34:40	But often the- when they were in small houses where they had to do everything , erm they tended to find that they were they were expected to sort of skivvy much more .
41:7	You had to put them all away !
50:84	Apart from worry about the safety of their nearest and dearest , what concerned them most was was that with the main breadwinner away , children still had to be fed and clothed and household expenses met .
58:22	No off days now , now she must carry on .
63:128	And many women actually did take to their beds when they were menstruating and erm sort of retired from active life and this was n't possible then because so many women had been called up you know and they had had to be in the army or they had to work in factories and it was n't possible for them to be absent .
63:152	And many women actually did take to their beds when they were menstruating and erm sort of retired from active life and this was n't possible then because so many women had been called up you know and they had had to be in the army or they had to work in factories and it was n't possible for them to be absent .
67:64	And erm so that the campaign was working on two levels one to persuade women that they did n't have to take time off from working in factories , at certain times of the month and another to persuade women to use erm internal sanitary protection and as I said I will explain why later it comes into another section .
90:25	It was a duty and I just have to take this one down .
91:12	You 'll have to excuse this picking up and putting down of , papers .
96:9	So you must n't , not only must n't you worry you 've got to be perfectly made up and have a super figure you know while you 're making tanks or or whatever .
96:23	So you must n't , not only must n't you worry you 've got to be perfectly made up and have a super figure you know while you 're making tanks or or whatever .
114:77	Once they 'd done with our , figures and our faces then we 'd got to look for our innards and so we had had to have inner cleanliness .
118:32	She stood on a chair and I used to have to draw the lines round the back of her legs with a pencil .
122:101	Women and Beauty in April nineteen forty three wrote - there is a special kind of beauty preparation that ca n't be bought in a single shop in the world because you must make it yourself from spirit , heart and simple courage and you make it fresh each day .
136:13	Of course you had to get them .
177:9	And farmers had to grow more cereal and vegetable crops .
289:9	Each garment had to conform to regulations on yardage and use of approved materials .
321:9	The designs had to be small to avoid wastage in matching .
324:7	You must keep to light , plain colours .
345:48	Yes , the red colour was always er and er this , so that the curtain had to be scrapped .
373:66	Magazines gave hints on how to m ake pretty collars and cuffs from scraps of unwanted material because we still had to look pretty .
427:19	Well I think we have to stop there for a little while because it 's nine o' clock , and I 've just got erm a few more pictures to show you later on so if we have a short break now , I think the coffee ladies are ready .
526:8	You had to have what they gave you and it was pretty revolting from what I remember .
537:49	Going back to the , the blitz when we were bombed out we erm had to during the day we lived in my aunt 's house mother and father and me .
558:48	And er one or two got caught up occasionally now and then so we did erm have to go underneath because I was earning too much to get a free one it cost me seven pounds ten and I 've got the receipt for it .
564:9	Each category had to be put in a different container and taken to a collection centre .
588:60	But we used to have these , these bins at the end of each road and we used to have to put any scrap or unwanted food in .
599:63	Well it was understood that Bisses got most of theirs from restaurants , and all restaurants I think had to sort of hand over all their waste for the war or something .
634:37	Women who preferred who preferred traditional methods of sanitary protection either had to stand in long queues in order to buy just one or two towels you could n't even buy a packet , you could just buy one or two or make do with other methods .
642:81	It was estimated that in August nineteen forty the war was costing between six and seven million pounds a day and that a great proportion of it must come from the savings of the people .
652:9	So you had to be careful of him .
671:30	And erm watch it all the things that one had to do to one 's car if one was able to use a car in the blackout .
717:37	Well I 'm afraid ladies and gentlemen we 're going to have to stop now , rather reluctantly .
771:50	Jan erm I 've just recently started a job as a drama teacher and I must say there is n't actually anything in the programme that 's actually on my A level syllabus for drama and I think it might be something er it a help to schools if maybe there was a play put on specifically schools to come and see I think to comment on . .
783:14	I think we have to face facts , first fact is the the priority of the board must at this time be survival .
783:56	I think we have to face facts , first fact is the the priority of the board must at this time be survival .
836:136	The one that has n't been in fact to employ somebody particularly perhaps to go out the market theatre but this particular mark in time it 's been very difficult for a theatre to actually find twenty thousand this financial year in fact we had to find seventy thousand pound cuts , that was a very difficult exercise so the answer to your question is we accept that recommendation and as soon as the finance is available we intend to employ somebody to take on that task .
843:55	We 're not saying we ca n't we we we 're against proposal we 've had to take on the market person but until that finance situation is eased it 's extremely difficult .
887:78	And I think what the Council 's got to do and I think what the what the what the theatre perhaps has to do is only make that leisure card more easily acceptable and available and also look upon the reductions that we give but that perhaps is a way of actually rewarding the people in Harlow to use the theatre and the contribution in actually paying for it at the expense of the people coming in from outside who perhaps do n't pay anything towards the expense of the theatre .
940:52	The theatre like most other organisations have actually looked for savings and this this trust has had to look for seventy thousand pounds savings .
943:112	Now we 've actually found seventy thousand pounds worth of savings we have n't made anybody redundant and we 've actually quite clearly taken in that seventy thousand pounds within our overall budget past decisions has had to be taken and they 've been taken as I said earlier hopefully when the financial climate gets better we perhaps we 'll be able to other things all or were revert back to things that we we do wish to do because the the financial restraints on us .
1022:15	Why does a view have to be expressed as a question ?
1024:15	Why does a view have to be expressed as a question ?
1027:65	following on from that er that the point that I think is being made is that a contribution does not have to be put forward in a shape of a question to be er a useful contribution to the debate and and your erm pressure upon er the lady who spoke er a while ago was er insisting that she she
1061:90	Will you allow people to address the panel as a a comment and not just a question yes or no if you say no fine we all understand and we have to er formulate our our ideas as a question and we 'll carry on that case is quite simple and straight forward like that .
1100:33	And the sort of er money that wo n't have to pay a reputable alternative theatre it was such that one could n't hope to break even on that capacity with the sort of seat prices that were that we 're charging .
1101:35	So sadly that was one of those things that we had to cut .
1104:191	For example if you had the London Mozart players here as we frequently did and frequently played to full houses , then even with a hundred percent house there was a subsidy required of something like seven or eight pounds per seat , in order to meet the cost of presenting that particular concert and we 've done it for years but sadly when we had to make cuts that was one of things the board decided they had to cut up they had to save money somehow .
1104:239	For example if you had the London Mozart players here as we frequently did and frequently played to full houses , then even with a hundred percent house there was a subsidy required of something like seven or eight pounds per seat , in order to meet the cost of presenting that particular concert and we 've done it for years but sadly when we had to make cuts that was one of things the board decided they had to cut up they had to save money somehow .

1156:91	And why the problems there is that any sort of loud music was actually buried under the auditorial I mean that was the problem that occurred and we had to sort of tone it down a bit .
1255:99	And it is you know it seems to take up quite a bit of time for members of staff and we do as many as we can but sometimes we have to say sorry we we ca n't do any more this week .
1296:54	Can I also point out that erm the association of natural body builders stipulate that a contest must be held in a seated theatre such as this .
1370:7	There must be a way round that .
1423:63	No I 'm not so I mean things like that there 's wear and tear I mean the seats have to be recovered the carpet 's have to be replaced the place has to be redecorated yes we do that .
1423:85	No I 'm not so I mean things like that there 's wear and tear I mean the seats have to be recovered the carpet 's have to be replaced the place has to be redecorated yes we do that .
1423:105	No I 'm not so I mean things like that there 's wear and tear I mean the seats have to be recovered the carpet 's have to be replaced the place has to be redecorated yes we do that .
1427:171	I think we need I accept I think we need to look at certain areas we need to look at the entrance I mean if we were doing the entrance again we would have electric doors on what like they 've got on the Harvey Centre so you do n't have to fight your way in I 'm thinking of doors like this we 'll do that .
1503:18	Well , I will then have to ring her wo n't I ?
1562:79	And apparently her view now is that because the Government ha have said , anybody who is interested in becoming a in nineteen ninety three , must register an interest on sixteenth this year , which is really , that 's , you know , there legislating for what they have n't got any power in nineteen ninety three .
1585:21	Right , well , we 'll have to , but you know if people have to let me know if they can turn up then .
1585:46	Right , well , we 'll have to , but you know if people have to let me know if they can turn up then .
1623:15	They , they will have to pick us up I 'm afraid , cos our pass is not valued till nine o' clock .
1648:20	Well the problem is he has to say he has a licence for you , he has n't so , it 's possible that Terry will be .
1688:7	They have to erm , first of all ask er R S P C A funding it , which is very much against anyway because I , I hate being humiliated by the this way .
1689:47	So if it 's a P D S A clinic you would n't have to do that you can just give er .
1730:10	We 'll have to make of this because we ca n't keep .
1733:15	Now that I had to get it to the by taxi and she had seven stitches put in the leg and , I had to leave her there for six hours , well then it was a taxi back home , I could n't now I am on income support , but that cost me fifty four pound , ninety five and I am paying that .
1733:75	Now that I had to get it to the by taxi and she had seven stitches put in the leg and , I had to leave her there for six hours , well then it was a taxi back home , I could n't now I am on income support , but that cost me fifty four pound , ninety five and I am paying that .
1879:72	We did ask Dorothy to do it after I did it for four years , but she was n't keen and I had to go on .
2033:32	I mean the communication strategy for this whole thing has got to be sorted out and , you know , we want , the leader wants staff involvement , public involvement in it erm , and erm , but I 'm just telling you advance on what 's gonna be told .
2110:10	perhaps you have to progress to have a toilet pass .
2299:33	No , they , they 've said in there you must n't .
2424:11	Well we must that 's why , certainly have to , before
2424:29	Well we must that 's why , certainly have to , before
2434:9	Do n't have to read it now cos it 's quite long .
2441:23	One of the major problems they have to face .
2461:82	Not round Havers , wh they park where those , those sort of shops are they they park all around the corners so that you have to go out round them .
2648:24	on Saturday and yet , that you have to be careful because they they have that I 've forgotten what her name was on on Wogan saying next time you go into a D I Y store and you see a mahogany toilet seat you know do n't boy buy it think of the forest .
2658:81	Cycle parking is actually I wish they 'd actually pay a bit more places to actually put your bike and you did n't have to sort of tie it up to some lamppost or something
2675:7	You must to cat .
2680:31	And I think that is exactly what we have to do as cyclists .
2688:40	They overtake you and then they slow right down so that you have to go oohooh and stop .
2703:25	But if you do get one you have to be careful you get one that 's done to the proper standard because some do n't work apparently .
2756:9	And you have to do it in office hours as well .
2797:72	I 've got all this money in the Abbey National and there 's no , no group any more , I think I 'll have to keep
2799:10	I 'll have to send it off to .
2801:22	Because you knew that they both had to agree before anything was done .
2869:58	But then you have then you have the stuff that does n't sell and deteriorates and you still have to have paid for it so
2890:88	Well , what I thought was with this one world week thing at least people that , who go might be more receptive to what we have to say to show and sell .
2954:15	I think we have to have something if we have a stall .
3023:34	And then you just do a run , you do n't have to go on to print it at all you just print it off .
3155:62	Because I know the scouts do the Tesco one and whenever they are put in these cardboard boxes they have to be sorted so somebody must sort them .
3155:82	Because I know the scouts do the Tesco one and whenever they are put in these cardboard boxes they have to be sorted so somebody must sort them .
3157:15	Erm so there must be somebody responsible and I think if , if we write swimming pool and people take their cans there
3158:13	Yes we 'd have to check .
3173:9	Do you have to sort it ?
3174:9	Do you have to take it sorted ?
3187:32	Because the money they can get for this mixed paper must be a pittance .
3251:7	you have to ring .
3261:25	Ah er the other item that we must mention is any extra plastic bags
3309:9	So they must still be doing them and that was two huge boxes .
3326:7	They must be going absolutely mad about East Germany must n't they ?
3326:31	They must be going absolutely mad about East Germany must n't they ?
3336:35	Well really I mean with quite a few you really have to watch out which is
3346:12	She did n't have to pay for it .
3390:7	They must be checked .
3421:31	Well , they wo n't because they they they have to make money in order to survive .
3423:7	They have to run it as a business now .
3454:26	Erm Well I think the furniture you have to take down to Ware when I last phoned .
3629:10	Oh that must be that must be the one er
3629:20	Oh that must be that must be the one er
3756:9	So we have to do
4002:14	Cos the there there must be useful contacts you see .
4032:36	I think last year more or less shows that we really have to concentrate on one thing .
4072:7	You have to write and and write more details or put more pressure on and have more people write .
4121:7	I had to write off
4199:7	There must be green solicitors about .
4200:7	I have to write to them and ask them and about a month later they reply to me and I pass it on to her .
4303:11	Because we have to have sash and sash soft wood .
4339:15	We shall just have to pretend it 's not there , there 's not , there 's not quite as bad as when I had to speak for Amnesty on Radio Essex last year and it was live , as every word , every word I spoke was being you know being heard by a lot of people and that 's , that was very , that was very intimidating .
4339:75	We shall just have to pretend it 's not there , there 's not , there 's not quite as bad as when I had to speak for Amnesty on Radio Essex last year and it was live , as every word , every word I spoke was being you know being heard by a lot of people and that 's , that was very , that was very intimidating .
4383:13	eleventh , always have to look at them to see
4431:77	and erm , they were absolutely chocker , they were really full and he said erm , I sa , he said he had n't had to fill them up at all in all the time that it 's been running , and no , I asked him if he had any enquiries and nobody stopped him and asked anything about it , and then he turned to the other lad who was beside him the sales assistant and he said no I 've had no enquiries at all , so that was it .
4466:24	I do n't know , you 'll have to ask Mary .
4499:24	Mm , well , we 'll just have to go , go easy .
4504:171	From , from Yugoslavia , and we , we heard provisionally he was released about August did n't we , and then eventually a couple of months ago that he had definitely released , erm , and , were , were very pleased about that cos was he released before the end of his term , he must have been ?
4650:28	at the moment we have nothing so just have to wait and see .
4912:31	Right , does Saria had a form , she must cos you said she 's booked , Peter have you g , Peter you 've got forms have you ?
4956:17	But eh , you 'd have to have it sort of written out and more or less ready I think to go .
5097:214	Erm , I think I will give up being Chair this time , I 've done it too long , too long , and I 've had it John as Co-Chair during the year and I hope that he 'll be able to carry on as , as Chair Person , I think really I 've done it , done it for long enough erm , and we 'll have to ask , we hope , we hope the Treasurer just taken over will carry on
5172:45	and I had , got pick up two so I , I just had to give up , I phoned him up when I got here , apologise , he has n't been in touch with Michael yet , I do n't know why not , er , though why , er sorry
5357:9	But there has to be one guarantee in because I think once we had rather good one , about six people kept , you can never tell how many come , I mean you 'd want maybe bigger , more than , more space in this room .
5418:20	As we know erm Canning had to a great extent welcomed the end of the congress system .
5639:52	So I I 've digressed er from er considering what erm erm er what this has got to do with the er erm congress of Vienna but I think it 's er hopefully er er a worthwhile erm er digression .
5920:28	Therefore I 'm afraid were going to have to pass Sue 's book around , we 'll leave the lights on and erm she 's changed the scripture of her talks so that she will be describing the picture why 'll its been passed round and could you please sort of pass it fairly quickly , I 'll be at the back and then I 'll come down into the front again , is there anyone who 's a poet ?
5934:65	So I was going to rummage through these slides and we do n't have them , erm so I 'll have to , I 'll hand the , the , the book around in just one minute , erm the poems that I 'm going to read to you , very few of them are actually complete , most of them are sketches erm ideas and images of erm , that I 've got , I 've , I 've got them from the paintings .
6010:77	yes , oh yes , and erm , going back to somebody asked me earlier , erm , about how it , I feel I have to be able to write about , just about anything , erm , and so if I was given commission to write about any one thing I would have to put myself in a position to , to be able to do it .
6010:168	yes , oh yes , and erm , going back to somebody asked me earlier , erm , about how it , I feel I have to be able to write about , just about anything , erm , and so if I was given commission to write about any one thing I would have to put myself in a position to , to be able to do it .
6021:29	Just seems that it , it to me must be wrong , that it did n't identify them because a particular picture anyway , the reason why I find difficulty in making
6145:28	If I tell you a story you 'd have to agree to tell it to somebody else .
6156:17	Well the story that I have to tell you to begin with comes all the way from a very hot and very large continent .
6187:47	One day she said , I 'll become the queen and then you 'll have to do everything I say .
6201:16	Now in Africa you must be careful of snakes because some of them are poisonous .
6220:22	It would break her heart to have to go away , even to be wife to a king .
6224:50	He is the one who 'll decide who is most worthy , so you must both go .
6226:73	Well , that night everyone went to sleep because if there was going to be a wedding everybody in the village would surely have to go .
6278:7	She must have left already said Mufaro .
6279:7	We must all follow .
6298:10	Surely there must be some wonderful things happening here .
6312:7	We must not be afraid .
6313:35	We have come here to see the king and we must all go into the temple .
6532:57	Cos this next story that I would to share with you is about a boy who I must have everybody sitting on their bottoms all alone please .
6543:70	But it was a time when the boy and his mother , who lived in a little cottage just outside the town , had to earn their living from growing their own vegetables and doing what they could to help other people in order to make a living .
6551:90	And at the end of the village there lived an old woman who was very very wise and said if you want to live for ever then you must speak to the person who 's the oldest person I know .
6672:20	What a very nice person you must be .
6755:7	I must go with my people .
6756:7	I must have it .
6762:8	I must go back to the sea , she said .
6765:35	And although she was sad , she knew that she had to go with him and she did .
6783:14	But boys you must all tell your father that he must look after you now .
6783:34	But boys you must all tell your father that he must look after you now .
6873:54	Now , in order for Donald to be able to hear the replies as well , we must only have one person talking at a time .
7084:26	But there 's one thing that you have to remember .
7085:58	I said at the beginning that you were gonna come and listen to our stories you also had to
7174:7	you must know where all the
7214:57	which is burnt off when the whole thing gets fired in the kiln , so what will have to happen is the , your pots you 've done so far , once they 're thoroughly dried and go into the kiln , they 're fired at a high temperature and then they 'll come out this bit fired you 'll then separate them with oxide pastes , dip them into glaze , which I 'll explain in a minute , and re-fire them at a higher temperature , the glazed would
7282:63	So imagine you were writing Jayne here J now it 's a very long name , Jayne and you have to put the title on there too , so I could n't put it all in capital letters on this occasion could I ?
7286:7	You have to use your common sense .
7361:63	I would like you all to try to remember the stages of the process because you 're going to have to do , as I said to you last lesson , a small write up on this in order to get your unit of accreditation for this work .
7372:10	Nevertheless we have to take proper precautions .
7409:7	We had to use turps did n't we , to dissolve the printing inks ?
7463:7	It has to be because we have to get our hands in .
7463:24	It has to be because we have to get our hands in .
7468:12	You do n't have to do this bit .
7535:20	What might have they have had to measure the time as it passed ?
7561:7	You must be careful not to unconsciously touch anything with even the gloves .
7637:7	You have to use an alcohol solvent to remove that when we need to remove it .
7654:15	Erm it would have to be if it were with water I 'd have to put something else in as well otherwise the stuff would n't stay on the page .
7654:48	Erm it would have to be if it were with water I 'd have to put something else in as well otherwise the stuff would n't stay on the page .
7656:55	So if I were using , making a water based printing ink , what other stuff would I have to put in as well as water ?
7663:10	You 'd have to put glue powder and water in to make a water based printing ink .
7682:12	And therefore they must be carefully looked after .
7749:7	We have to be very methodical when we do this .
7794:26	You 'll see that the pressure is must be quite enormous and produced a raised section there .
7800:9	So you must remember if you ever put any lettering on when you 're printing that you must write it backwards .
7800:57	So you must remember if you ever put any lettering on when you 're printing that you must write it backwards .
7842:30	But , remember these are wet so you have to leave them out , flat to dry .
7844:12	And I 'll have to teach you precisely how to sign them up .
7845:7	You must also learn how to clean up after yourselves .
7846:48	Mrs clean er tables for you when we 've been doing now you have to do it yourselves .
7854:7	You have to pay attention to that part and that part too .
7862:12	display I have to put out .
7885:7	I must stop using my words so carefully .
7915:15	Well we do n't have to pay attention to it and er it 's not necessary to record every word is it ?
7918:12	We do n't have to speak at it or anything .
7972:10	We 'll have to see if we can or not .
8016:100	just by way of comparison for rough guidance that there is a regulation or or something like that which says , if I remember rightly , that erm er payments must not be made for either services or goods not supplied above a figure of two thousand pounds without er being taken to committee first .
8074:114	Er and therefore erm I think we 'd like to to some degree wait and see a bit still because er I think that you know economic circumstances of this particular moment mean that we may just have to consider that further of seeing how things progress really between now and October .
8077:40	Whether we would go to the full two fifty I think will have to be you know we 'll have to wait till nearer the time .
8077:66	Whether we would go to the full two fifty I think will have to be you know we 'll have to wait till nearer the time .
8135:33	Number six which is the thing that we have to look at .
8142:188	And if it were possible for you to decide that one of these options , one to eight , were to suit your regular and usual purposes at these meetings for general discussion then that obviously would be both a saving in erm time and labour and is one of the reasons why one installs computerized equipment so that you do n't er then have to do it all manually as well .
8143:32	Obviously I would be very loathe to agree to have to now provide different information again other than that which is going to be readily er available through the computers .
8156:23	I think first of all we have to satisfy ourselves do n't we that we 're erm fulfilling our cultural obligations cultural policy .
8173:13	And whether we had to keep running those slots .
8225:9	So that has to be worked at and then you , you know , would begin to look at whether that has any effect on your admissions and so on .
8285:49	Er but I mean basically at the end of the day , I mean you have to think about to what extent you can increase your sales .
8380:16	Erm sorry , I must say
8429:71	A question I would ask is that given the product which you had in June and the fact that presumably you have to take what goes , presumably the fact that they do n't send you the strongest stuff erm are you surprised that the figures were down in view of the quality of what you had , or are you surprised it might not have been worse ?
8522:71	But if it were if it were to be slashed or erm you know and er on Monday evening we would have to get a screen we would have to replace that screen immediately .
8522:95	But if it were if it were to be slashed or erm you know and er on Monday evening we would have to get a screen we would have to replace that screen immediately .
8535:15	And er the decision had to be taken to bring in erm security guards
8576:15	I mean you must have a lot of cases whereby where , where you are actually perhaps er er a taxi needs to be paid for to take
8580:7	There must be lots of cases where you are actually paying the window cleaner cash in hand or something .
8705:10	We do have to bear in mind that our rent has increased er our own rent to Morgan Estates and so on .
8721:20	Particularly , you know it has to be said there is a particular age class background and so on and so forth .
8731:58	Well it is quite true that if you come to eat before you see a film you have to ask if they can do it in time .
8779:20	My view is that this has to be negotiated with them and I would be very loathe for us to start imposing erm
8806:87	But even though they guaranteed to provide every customer who had allowed three quarters of an hour er for a meal , you know , you would have to lay down in very great deal would n't you ?
8843:17	Well then you 're gonna have to say farewell .
8959:7	Everything has to have a till receipt .
8960:27	You can check the till rolls which have to be kept .
9019:102	Right yes I am keen on that because I think er one of the keys to growth in our business is to attract more people and to attract people you must tell them that we 're here and what we 're doing .
9159:15	Yes , you 'll have to buy a chart for that one person
9170:12	so it really has to be the person in each city erm who then gets together with a general coordinator .
9295:5	have to describe and
9350:47	You know , I mean , I 'm just thinking out loud , it has to be someone that you can leave messages with
9393:17	and he said I have to admit I did n't act on your phone call and I felt like braining him I really did
9467:34	and er , you know we , we would just have to
9525:139	and to cut a long story short , we went to see three possible funders , er funder one was T S B Foundation , where to cut a long story short I 'm pretty sure that T S B er we , we have to put an application in for October I think we 'll , we 'll buy us another system
9596:61	but not impulsively , but the , what I did have a concern about and I think we 'll have to be a bit careful about this as we go forward is that , the audio description project is about audio description , youth and funding is about volunteers
9633:17	due to the timing we have to apply to Carn , well the deadline for Carn Carn the deadline for UFAF comes first
9652:31	I mean we 'll , we 'll obviously have to sort of keep a , keep an eye on all this all the way through
9665:39	Yeah , well , no I 'm thinking that these , these applications have to be in both of them by the end of September and I do n't
9763:4	must get something
9789:22	saying the opposite , but you do have to remind people what you 're doing
9850:74	In some ways wh I , I , I heard , I was listening to a description on Saturday at the serials and I must admit I thought to myself mm
9889:65	Margaret , can you give me a phone number for her because I thought if they do that they must put her on plays with us students
9899:86	is that , that we as a group can , can er video the production , but it was at Perth , but in this case it would have to be
9910:224	he 's retired , but he 's , he 's been quite busy with this Festival , but I , I said to him , now what I 'll do is maybe come and you and him and Jane maybe kind of will just sort of have a quick confab sometime just talk about what he wants , and he will be kind of happy to do that with obviously we 'd have to find a drop of money to pay for the tapes , I mean that would n't be huge and expensive .
9923:9	and he has to represent his neighbours , erm so erm so we would need to guar give guarantees , I think that would have to be
9923:77	and he has to represent his neighbours , erm so erm so we would need to guar give guarantees , I think that would have to be
9924:5	have to give guarantees that the tape would not be abused , but I mean that in , in , in actuality you know , if it was you doing the training
9926:29	it comes down for you and you would have to sign documents of , erm , anyway so it 's
9945:18	I think you 'd have to
9968:16	I think there must be because I 've seen it several times now and just in , in , you know
10188:107	I do , I like , do you think I could have a copy of anything you 've got to date because lying in my desk this morning is something I have to prepare a briefing note for my chairman and I was thinking about that recent one , but I could n't put my hand on it Robert , absolutely updated on exactly where we are .
10215:12	Well you 'll have to get that fitted in somehow I 'll , I 'll fit it
10238:133	thing and you know , they were over and some of them were doing something and it is somebody you normally and the news and I said the news and actually sort of frozen and the guy said to me , he must of actually seen me frozen there , he said it 's okay , it 's okay , it 's nothing about whatever her name is , you know
10443:16	Well what we might have to do is concoct something up on a letter , a stand have you a standard charge ?
10444:39	but it does n't matter whether it was , you do n't have to do one
10566:15	I think they had to take the
10570:51	Yes it would be good to get the Trone to do that again , we must have
10740:41	now the next one does n't go out until October so you would have to have something in November
10819:42	Do level one and level two , the ones that you you have to do and if there 's any time left at the end of the year do the ones that that you missed out .
10953:12	but you still have to take care in case somebody says well I 've just done fractions two , and you say but you have n't done fractions
11150:19	you know we we must be talking about July when we sh when we present , when we produce erm one of these pieces of paper .
11243:7	It has to be remembered as well that this is my interpretation of the blurb that S M P have sent out .
11264:7	it had to appear twice properly
11304:20	that you still either gonna have to fill in anything else that you 've covered with them
11532:44	It is a report to parents and I mean , under legislation we have to report
11610:4	have to
11660:26	Yes , but all form tutors are gonna have to become aware of each subject 's
11713:121	but at the same time I would want to afford er , you as heads of departments er er everybody 's heads of department a little bit of leeway what i what if , what wa wa we have to be careful about this that we set a standard but allow a little leeway because all departments are slightly different and want to approach things
11718:52	And if you do n't feel that you can fit in a pupil comment , you have to be very careful here because some people will take it as a cop-out and not do it and a that worries me and it has happened and I think it is important that the youngsters are actually given some guidance and the opportunity to do it .
11776:12	but you do have to remember as I say
11778:10	you do have to remember at the same time that these documents would be going home and
11825:12	I do n't have to look , if I can just
11827:12	I do n't have to look
11832:14	I do n't have to look too far back in there when we started this whole process , four or five years of throwing it all up in the air to say that I felt every pupil could comment in some way , something that they had enjoyed , something they felt they 'd been successful at , something they felt they found difficult , something that had pleased them , surely every child could comment on wo , if it 's just one of those things
11880:9	But I have to put back to you that the onus then falls on you and head 's of departments to ensure that that space is used properly .
11884:11	And I have to say my experience it leaves me to doubt , I know I 'm a cynic sometimes , that the space will not be used effectively and
12118:206	I think we 're losing track of what this actually is Paul , there are , you 're trying to do two things at once what you 're trying to do , I think is use it as a learning process for children but this is an annual report for parents and I think that part of it a at least surely must be a report by the sa member of staff , by the department on how the child has done , by the member staff .
12119:80	By all means give the , give the kid a chance to , to put his side of the story if you like , but there must be er
12166:63	comment area when we , these go out there would be guidance which would say their staff must make their comment in that space
12172:20	you wish so , they must certainly be involved in the process
12243:10	Ha I have to go along here some , to some of you with a bossy statement of you know , this inclusive as opposed
12330:4	have to be a little parcel wo n't it ?
12367:69	Erm I would differ er , with that opinion because I would say that the comment as a joint comment would erm have to deal with the general skills and abilities
12388:18	The first part of it must be a staff comment .
12510:37	Well it 's not that open because we 're saying there must be some staff something written by staff
12515:7	Staff have to write their comments
12521:17	and involve them they must be involved must n't they ?
12521:28	and involve them they must be involved must n't they ?
12525:4	must be involved in in some form
12544:69	A a a member of staff may feel that they want to say something about a kid , and it does not necessarily have to agree with what the kid
12549:22	then he will have under me have to say , Jimmy does not agree with this
12551:30	he feels , and so on , but there has got to be something that is obvious staff comment .
12637:46	what other departments feel to your to your people , because wha , you do have to be careful about the indoctrination , this is what I believe so it 's right , we 've gotta we do have to strike a balance .
12637:119	what other departments feel to your to your people , because wha , you do have to be careful about the indoctrination , this is what I believe so it 's right , we 've gotta we do have to strike a balance .
12638:38	I mean I 've got my own thoughts , I have to be careful here that you know I 've got to try and pull together what you think because at the end of the day it 's it 's very important that it reflects the way we work in school , not the way I perceive I we work in in school because you 're the people at the chalk first .
12641:12	that we have to do in a certain way , in a certain format and certain things have got to be included and we 've got to take that in hand as well .
12641:52	that we have to do in a certain way , in a certain format and certain things have got to be included and we 've got to take that in hand as well .
12672:9	which has got to be this
12890:39	immediately we come back , which is something else we have to sort out with our heads now .
13136:13	Yeah we I must admit , would a , would a parent , I mean I was at a very simple level , following instructions , go and get that ruler Jimmy ?
13155:7	It must be there cos it 's
13236:53	remember that just a few weeks ago that you were de , almost denying that we 'd have to do this sort of thing !
13247:118	No , all I 'm saying is that I 'd like to support Don and what Don 's just said there and I think that er , we a that is what we are gonna have to do .
13326:34	that Alan 's saying and I think we 'll have to respect that with all du
13329:30	Ah , but at the same time we do n't have to comment on mathematical skills at G C S E .
13332:15	I think we have to recognise Angela 's concern if er a subject area that she 's trying to present , present and she is not precluding you from doing what you 've got
13393:24	with all due respect here we have to respect the wishe , Angela 's wishes , er , I mean , on the one hand we 're respecting Alan 's er er and I I
13495:18	more and more once we have to put descriptions of levels down , there will be words
13589:144	No , well I 'm I 'm saying to you the same sort of things , in general skills and abilities there are certain things that we required to put in the er numeracy the literacy er , to some degree attendance and punctuality , although we do n't have to do it on a subject specific basis erm we , everybody wants to know about he young , ho whether their youngsters are trying i.e. effort ha , whether they behave in lessons .
13683:12	Cos these 'll have to be clarified to some degree .
13698:18	I think that we must whe when we 're , we we must come to some sort of consensus in the staff as to what the levels mean in inverted commas .
13698:43	I think that we must whe when we 're , we we must come to some sort of consensus in the staff as to what the levels mean in inverted commas .
13831:13	We I 'll have to
13835:10	I 'll have to back through my
13868:4	have to er er I 'll I 'll try and come up with some talk of , some sort of definitions , guidelines of , I mean , effort 's effort , I do , do you have to explain effort ?
13868:115	have to er er I 'll I 'll try and come up with some talk of , some sort of definitions , guidelines of , I mean , effort 's effort , I do , do you have to explain effort ?
13884:7	have have to be at that 's why it 's a ten point scale
13885:33	Yeah but I do n't see how that might have to relate to national curriculum er
13892:17	Ah , we do n't have to
13895:48	I 'm not saying that what I 'm saying is that that we must all have at the back of our minds a a sort of considered opinion of what 's
14101:15	I suppose it must be .
14105:33	Fair enough but in the future so as not to have to
14174:94	If we cheated about not having it back you know , when parents came in June but we do n't need it immediately you know , it does n't have to be photocopied so that we all
14318:34	Well I think what we 'll , she 'll have to do
14319:18	erm what we 'll have to do , I , I 'll put this attendance put an
14345:21	Because I think you 'll have to check availabilities for accommodation in here before you made a decision because the
14438:20	from one area , you 'd have to find four or five caretakers , which is impossible .
14503:52	Would we need , we 'd also need some kind of refreshments and er we 'll have to make a decision about lunch .
14563:28	Er and I would guess then we would have to switch it to a , a Saturday .
14603:11	I 'd have to , I 'd have to erm I 'd have to raise it er and I think to be quite honest the er I mean fortunately as I said earlier on Mr chairman there is a Regional Liaison Group meeting on , on Monday er and I have a captive audience of three budget holders , Doug Gill and Phil , erm and raise this with them .
14603:26	I 'd have to , I 'd have to erm I 'd have to raise it er and I think to be quite honest the er I mean fortunately as I said earlier on Mr chairman there is a Regional Liaison Group meeting on , on Monday er and I have a captive audience of three budget holders , Doug Gill and Phil , erm and raise this with them .
14603:44	I 'd have to , I 'd have to erm I 'd have to raise it er and I think to be quite honest the er I mean fortunately as I said earlier on Mr chairman there is a Regional Liaison Group meeting on , on Monday er and I have a captive audience of three budget holders , Doug Gill and Phil , erm and raise this with them .
14634:144	Because I think you could , you could come back here in three weeks time and find that you , you 've got , you 're not gonna get time off on a Friday , you have n't got enough and then you 're going to have to start all over again .
14692:77	You know , all this is I mean we 've got a month actually which is a good thing but erm surely you must have some sort of agreements with the union and your and
14752:18	I think it would have to be some time this week .
14801:51	We might get paid release we might not erm and I think we 're gonna have to leave it and make some further enquiries and get back .
14818:9	Does it have to be in ?
14820:9	Does it have to be in ?
14991:47	We could slot in our ag our agreed words erm that would n't , would n't have to wait till the Regional Liaison Group met because we 've just got the three kingp king kingpins hopefully er and , and try and er you know circumvent that .
15016:55	Now you can say to them well we 're gonna be struggling we we well we must be , we 've got three voices .
15044:15	Where , there has to be a starting figure and it 's never come out .
15076:23	Erm I think what we have to do in particular as , as , as full time officers is , is probably try and er and erm chase things up although they they 're within the realms of the respo the respective LEC 's but to try and make sure that they do get some clearer , if not confirmed , insight into re in relation to the contribution aspect .
15239:9	Do we have to show both ?
15251:22	er , yes , well it has to be up
15374:60	I do n't know whether if you think there 's going to be a nuclear fallout and you have to inform all the other countries in Europe and the world or whatever
15427:55	lot , they , they thought that lot was set below them , that the women had to sort that side of things out and they erm really set a great
15469:83	On having ideals , like as you grow older , I mean you 're quite an ancient person already , within the next ten years you 'll have to choose the sort of lifestyle you want and you really have to choose as well whether you 're going to involve other people in it for good or for
15469:124	On having ideals , like as you grow older , I mean you 're quite an ancient person already , within the next ten years you 'll have to choose the sort of lifestyle you want and you really have to choose as well whether you 're going to involve other people in it for good or for
15527:12	so I 'll have to think of someone that may need , need help in
15568:22	set this to right , we must stop
15609:107	corinder and no more except on occasions with great the bowl never wanted washing , the boys polished , polished them with their spoons till they shone again and when they , when they had to form this operation , which never took very long , the bowl , they would sit staring at the copper with such eager eyes as if they could of devoured a of which it was composed .
15843:28	Yes I would care for when I had to do something , rather than just go straight into that , good
15870:12	Erm , I had to have my luggage checked at the airport
15871:9	I had to have my luggage checked at the airport , you see what 's happened to the end of that word , look at it right , you 've got age at the end because what rule is working there ?
15883:18	erm , I , I have to suggest that the erm the had er
15884:26	mm , that 's right , I had to suggest the captain 's orders .
15927:12	Erm I had to wriggle out of the scrum
15928:7	I had to wriggle out of the scrum , right , good
15930:7	I have to say farewell to my
15955:7	I must just jump up and down on Mrs when I see her at lunch time .
15966:7	We had to do , do jobs
15973:17	The time when it has to come in .
15974:25	Yes , the time when it has to come in , the day I say I want to collect it , now you might need to say to yourself , oh dear , Mrs said the deadline was , have I met it ?
16349:7	He must of left just after I did
16379:34	Is there anyone who does n't understand what they have got to go home and do ?
16490:7	It must be county
16508:26	Anyone standing for election at local government level has to have an election agent .
16510:9	The agent has to fill in the financial returns has to send in a report of financial expenditure .
16510:32	The agent has to fill in the financial returns has to send in a report of financial expenditure .
16528:94	And we had an example of that , a good example this year of course with erm that in that , in the spring of this year John Major erm had to call an election before June twentieth I think the date was because by that time then parliament would have automatically been dissolved .
16531:13	Why does it have to be on a Thursday ?
16540:37	But there is nothing laid down in law whereby it has to be a Thursday .
16549:12	It does n't have to be a Thursday .
16670:127	But B of course if you did badly in those elections in May the government might have done badly in May , then morale would have been rock bottom of having to go into an election , he would have had to go for an election six weeks later or they 'd run out of time , yeah .
16718:38	Cos if , if about eight percent of the people do n't have to vote anyway some people are n't gonna vote .
16739:9	And there must be a sixty percent majority vote at the council meeting in support of the proposal .
16802:13	Because these elections have to be organized three years running .
17065:12	Now , you must remember , in the link sheet make sure you back up whatever you 're getting here .
17067:22	And , of course , you do have to log it , one of those various exercises and so on .
17073:32	If you kill your mummy and daddy I 'll have to talk to you Peter !
17083:10	Oh no , must n't !
17084:30	How your knowledge is in millimetres , no I must n't use millimetres !
17174:48	Now , those two people or others who have n't used it much you really must get into this disc !
17176:7	You have to have a stu , a good familiarity with organic momegiture if you do n't , you could be throwing marks away even before you get in that exam room !
17177:29	Cos there will be aspects where you will have to use momegiture .
17178:69	That they ask you specific questions of that naming it 's a multi-choice more importantly in your written answers you will have to in , you are expected to include and correct systematic ohms for any organics that you deal with .
17180:12	So you really have got to get to grips with it !
17185:7	You must hit it on a regular basis !
17205:30	Positional isomerism is very obvious the only thing you have to watch out for , if the give you structural formulae especially multi-choice papers they 're buggers they are when they , when they do this sometimes !
17210:10	You really have to watch that !
17216:141	Now , in terms of naming these always you go for the longest straight shape that you can , by straight straight really is in inverted commas what we should really say the longest continuous chain that you can find in other words , you 'd have to go back on yourself .
17334:32	so it 's three comma three dash cos you have to indicate because you 've said die methile , you have to indicate where both of those groups are not just one .
17334:69	so it 's three comma three dash cos you have to indicate because you 've said die methile , you have to indicate where both of those groups are not just one .
17371:60	. This is an alcohol it has an O H group so it is a butanole but you have to indicate where the O H group actually is it 's either on four or it 's on one .
17373:121	So you 'd name this as butane in other words , you 're saying it 's a butane chain you take off the E you will add O L and if there are positional isomers possible you have to indicate the position one O L butane one L one O L butane one O L .
17389:11	Because you have to take the last number off it .
17497:107	So this one would be called bute two E and so again , these are true positional isomers same carbon skeleton they differ in the position of the principle functional group , which in this case , has to be a special electrons .
17554:42	You know you put an E under the first one , do you have to ?
17619:30	Right , now this thing here what you have to e , do , have to do is to imagine that it 's an alkane with this oxygen containing group butane .
17619:46	Right , now this thing here what you have to e , do , have to do is to imagine that it 's an alkane with this oxygen containing group butane .
17652:7	You have to get him wound down a bit , you have to do it , you know of a about half an hour or so ask him for the proper name !
17652:38	You have to get him wound down a bit , you have to do it , you know of a about half an hour or so ask him for the proper name !
17706:21	But yo , but luckily we had to check our bottles to make sure there 's no peroxides in them .
17831:10	You only have to slap this end and it passes along anyway !
17929:63	There are various ways of using them one way , to look through which yo , which you have to to see the light , you know , otherwise you wo n't see it !
17932:13	You do actually have to look through to see the light coming out !
17934:99	What you then do make a note of that all that , as I read it to you what you then do is to put your solution into that container you have to otherwise it comes out the ends !
17951:33	And you measure the angle through which you 've had to turn to get to that position , and which direction you 've had to turn it through or rather , which direction the light had been rotated through .
17951:77	And you measure the angle through which you 've had to turn to get to that position , and which direction you 've had to turn it through or rather , which direction the light had been rotated through .
17967:12	Right now you must be able to recognise in , either a structural formula or a condensed formula you must be able to recognise existence of what is called and asymmetric centre if you are a chemist kiral centre if you are a super chemist if you are a biologist an atom bonded to different ones .
17967:56	Right now you must be able to recognise in , either a structural formula or a condensed formula you must be able to recognise existence of what is called and asymmetric centre if you are a chemist kiral centre if you are a super chemist if you are a biologist an atom bonded to different ones .
18104:82	Erm chemically speaking , if you carry out a reaction which can produce an optically active compound , you would normally the recenate and then you have to separate by either chemical method or the physical method and it 's usually not very easy .
18105:84	If you 're gonna separate chemically , say for example , you produced erm an organic acid which is optically active the things you would normally have to do is to use a base to make the salt of , you know , you make the two optically salt and then separate them by a thing such as fractional crystallisation and then we generate the acid afterwards very very tricky !
18164:8	I must just say to yo , you 're dying to ask , like what he 's doing over the corner ?
18233:26	When you 're in public life you have to put up with er cameras and er things going erm around so and we 're going to be er , completely anonymous in er that , so
18271:116	On page one o eight paragraph two point two er , the society proposals of the er , in accordance with the objectives we 've taken out overall , it wants to be clear that it must mean it 's in total , the objectives .
18283:46	If you do n't mind I 'll stand up cos I 'm gonna have to shoot over there to the plans in some stage in the , in the presentation .
18306:53	And we 've written into our arrangements with any contractor , in the tender documentation that they have to adhere to the er requirements of the master plan .
18323:25	I thought that I was gonna have to er , talk about phasing but I think that he 's dealt with that quite adequately but I certainly will be happy answer any questions afterwards if if there are any .
18408:149	Er , it 's not a funding system that er that we would choose to to work under , we would want to keep the rents as low as possible er , but it 's one that 's set by central government through the housing corporation and that we have to live with .
18411:60	Er the fact of the matter is , it 's the system that we as housing associations gonna have to live with er if if we 're going to build new homes .
18433:82	Erm we have taken various steps immediately , one is that the vandalism that taking place over the erm we have immediately re-secured , I have to say there 's been about fifty erm tickets out to re-secure those those , that site over the summer but they have been re-secured and tomorrow morning there will be the commencement of bricking up of the doors and windows of the ground floor of block D , block .
18442:100	Well hm you can see that er , members are also very concerned about it and er we 've er , i there are external circumstances that you know , we have to look into first .
18531:61	Er , as you know , I have n't been exactly an enthusiastic supporter of neighbourhood erm areas , but I have to confess
18533:8	I have to confess that on that , in so far as those that I 've attended , and I 've had a couple in my area I have to confess my surprise at the efficiency of them !
18533:92	I have to confess that on that , in so far as those that I 've attended , and I 've had a couple in my area I have to confess my surprise at the efficiency of them !
18598:34	At the end we er , of the day I had to opt out because it was n't possible for me to fit in and someone else a , I 'm just thinking of the time taken for er , er housing manager or one of his er , staff to erm er , you know , to do that practical thing that 's all
18618:34	Actually , I did n't see the job advertised , I must admit , I was going to apply for it myself of course !
18634:19	Erm not only will people have to travel a lot further for treatment , as was admitted at the public meeting erm last Monday , here in Harlow but er if people want to is maybe they 'll one or two less senior f the area committee authority they will have to travel to Witham or Colchester or whatever , by absolutely execrable public transport if they do n't drive a motor car to actually attend those meetings and that 's not democratic or accountable either !
18634:158	Erm not only will people have to travel a lot further for treatment , as was admitted at the public meeting erm last Monday , here in Harlow but er if people want to is maybe they 'll one or two less senior f the area committee authority they will have to travel to Witham or Colchester or whatever , by absolutely execrable public transport if they do n't drive a motor car to actually attend those meetings and that 's not democratic or accountable either !
18694:12	However , one has to bear in mind that at the last meeting of the West Essex Health Authority erm they are saying that they ca n't carry on treating the same amount of people erm , because they 're overspend already this year and that they will not treat these er , extra contractual referrals without prior funding being approved and that was co , that was actually stated at the meeting last week .
18711:60	Erm ya , I mean I 've already had what , I 've had what I 've had to say about the the the content of the thing I was merely going to ask where we go from here ?
18713:119	Erm I wonder how substantially it 's going to re-written , first , in order to make it a response rather than an issue raising paper and ah , secondly , in the light of what we 've all had to say this evening and , if it is to be re-written I wonder erm who is going to actually see it and approve it before it goes off in time to get to the health authority by the day after tomorrow ?
18778:24	Er , the , so something must be done quickly , I fear , about the er , management er of er , er the , the new structure and I hope you would agree to it unless anyone else has got , yes ?
18897:42	So I think any future in and negotiations with the er , there has to be provision for social housing .
18976:11	So , we must oppose that and er also they 're asking for new powers er to move illegal travellers from land this is just another device because of their failure to provide sufficient sites throughout the country and if the of Essex County Council do their job er they they do n't need these new powers , what authority ought to be ha , er having are powers to provide some er , camping places for people .
18978:24	If they stop the altogether we have to act very quickly .
18988:14	so therefore , it must be granted .
19004:41	Well I ca , I 'll ask a question then so that will have to be answered .
19017:67	Harlow should of applied for a designation a long time ago if Harlow had been designated then surrounding councils would have had to live up their responsibilities to provide adequate sites for travellers which they have not done and successive governments have also failed to apply the caravan sites act nineteen sixty eight adequately .
19052:49	I 'll I 'll be going to the village hall but I me I have to
19134:38	You are aware Miss that any persons working in that department have got to be of age ?
19142:67	And we 're going to grant this protection order which is temporary permission to keep the premises open and I must tell you that there will be a lot more investigation before the order is granted that the transfer is specialist .
19159:7	You must produce that license otherwise it 's not effective er , Miss !
19239:56	Well all I can suggest is the case is adjourned for the week we 'll just have to arrange a solicitor to be here .
19242:32	In that case of the day sir because the statements have to read out in full .
19255:59	if it is to be arranged and that you 're dealt with at another court Crown Court will have to arrange that .
19258:87	As I say sir we put this matter down till later in the day , the defendant wi will not appear to be represented therefore the committal will have to be dealt with by re reading out all the statements .
19265:10	You 'll have to .
19266:31	But because you 're not represented the statements will have to be read out !
19300:14	So he does n't have to , on conditional bail today ?
19335:21	Does that mean I do n't have to apply for another licence ?
19447:144	He receives for his employment a take home pay of seventy three pounds per week , he lives with his parents and pays a board of twenty pounds per week he 's fortunate in that his employer takes him to work in the mornings but he has to catch the bus home in the evening and at lunchtime on Saturdays which costs him seven pounds forty .
19551:8	You must start paying five pounds a week by next Tuesday the court usher will give you the address of the court but you must make you send that money every week .
19551:76	You must start paying five pounds a week by next Tuesday the court usher will give you the address of the court but you must make you send that money every week .
19591:47	I 'll , I 'll be going to the village hall but I might have to go back to the Cross Keys , that 's why I put Roger , perhaps I put the wrong thing on you see ?
19664:38	You are aware Miss that any persons working in that department have got to be of age ?
19672:70	Well we 're going to grant this protection order which is temporary permission to keep your premises open , but I must tell you that there will be a lot more investigation before the order is granted permanently and the transfer stands .
19686:8	You must produce that licence , otherwise it 's not effective er Miss .
19763:41	All I can suggest sir is the case is adjourned just have to arrange for a solicitor to be here .
19767:48	In that case put it back to later in the day sir because the statements have to be read out in court .
19785:41	The defendant would not appear to be represented , therefore the committal will have to be dealt with by the way of reading out all the statements .
19792:31	That because you 're not represented the statements will have to be read out which will then take quite some time .
19851:61	Well it says on the bottom of er your copy of the charge sheet production of driving licence you must produce it .
19863:21	Do that mean I do n't have to apply for another licence ?
19965:215	And what Mr says in respect of er those three offences is that erm the officer , he accepts , did tell him that he was obliged to produce the documents to a police station but he says that he was suffering some shock as a result of the road accident and er he did n't appreciate what the officer was saying to him at the time and , never having had to produce his documents at the police station before , er he had never er known that that was a procedure that had to be followed .
19965:283	And what Mr says in respect of er those three offences is that erm the officer , he accepts , did tell him that he was obliged to produce the documents to a police station but he says that he was suffering some shock as a result of the road accident and er he did n't appreciate what the officer was saying to him at the time and , never having had to produce his documents at the police station before , er he had never er known that that was a procedure that had to be followed .
19976:52	He 's fortunate in that his employer takes him to work in the mornings but he has to catch the bus home in the evening and a at lunchtime on Saturdays which costs him seven pounds forty .
20074:92	Well my husband had a job here we moved from Highbury in in London because his firm moved from Highbury in London to here and erm got so we had to move with my husband because of his job , you see ?
20080:9	Our children had to go to Chingford to school .
20081:213	My daughter was of er grammar school erm tuition but we could n't put her into anywhere here because there were no schools available Loughton would n't take her neither would er , Bishop 's Stortford because they were the only two grammar schools available here and erm my dau , other daughter with many other children er , well all the , children of the residency in Tanys Dell and the Glebelands had to travel to Chingford every day to school .
20100:84	I mean , when we came here , as I say , we had nothing , our children , if they wanted erm any entertainment we had to make our own entertainment , which we did .
20107:8	We had to fight for parks swimming pools everything that we wanted , we had to fight for !
20107:49	We had to fight for parks swimming pools everything that we wanted , we had to fight for !
20110:21	And , very hard working people have had to do the fighting for what we have got !
20151:183	And the following visit he made here he brought with him Miss Virginia she was one of the personnel at Stepney Causeway she was the Miss Virginia , the niece of the line and she came and she said that she would help in erm doing some organisation and and giving us some insight as to what we had to do , because we had never run a fete in all our lives !
20160:9	All we had to do was to pay the expense of the helicopter that brought him in because at that time he was appearing at the Prince of Wales and it was a matter of him fitting his time in with his performances , you see ?
20168:130	It was worth all the hard work that we had put into it because it got that we used to use the town park towards the latter part of Barnardos day and all the men that we had gathered together used to have to erect every piece of fence to enclose like it is now , the park , is enclosed now with with fencing the men that were helping us did that all voluntarily !
20243:98	She has just this last year to go and er we hope for her sake everything goes well for her because she 's brilliant , and as you see I have to fly the flag for her because she 's
20246:14	But erm we have to fly the flag !
20394:72	No , no , no you 've got it the wrong way round , I went , I brought you here and then I had to go back cos I was in the Royal Marine Police
20401:19	do n't you remember you had to go to the housing office
20415:54	We came on a , I think it was on a Friday or Saturday morning and I had to go back Sunday night , cos I was on duty on the Monday back in Plymouth , and I did a month in Plymouth , er , a month or five weeks no longer , and I came up each weekend to see them , my wife was left there then .
20417:8	It must of been , it must of been very difficult for her ?
20417:22	It must of been , it must of been very difficult for her ?
20422:35	and all our shopping was down at the Old Town , you had to go down this lane to the Old Town if you wanted a stamp
20443:97	he passed his eleven plus as it was then and er he went to a school called Regent Street Grammar school in Plymouth and when we moved in here I had to go to Holly House , I think they call it
20450:10	Poor Keith had to go to this , he had to go the station every day on his bike
20450:31	Poor Keith had to go to this , he had to go the station every day on his bike
20458:12	He did n't have to change , no , but , how , how far 's Newport then ?
20460:120	anyhow that made me feel there was no future in Plymouth for that , so this opportunity came , I came and when I got here they did n't carry any sergeants so I would of had to move again if I wanted promotion , which I was n't prepared to do for this , mainly for his education , unfortunately the
20544:174	no it was really New Town school children , because there was Forbert and Barnard 's school down the Old Town and that 's where the Old Town , all the Old Town people went , children went , so really Mark Hall was just New Town children you know , and then when , when we were eleven and had to go to another school we , er there was no comprehensive school in Harlow then , er we had to get on a bus and go to Chingford that was , did n't we ?
20544:232	no it was really New Town school children , because there was Forbert and Barnard 's school down the Old Town and that 's where the Old Town , all the Old Town people went , children went , so really Mark Hall was just New Town children you know , and then when , when we were eleven and had to go to another school we , er there was no comprehensive school in Harlow then , er we had to get on a bus and go to Chingford that was , did n't we ?
20546:16	We used to have to catch the bus every morning and go to Chingford to school until Mark Hall was built and , erm and there was only one part of Mark Hall school built when we went there , there was only a few classrooms and er , it 's all grew up , the school grew up around us you know it 's a bit
20563:43	I suppose I can understand it now , I mean it must of been a lovely place , and then to have all these new houses going up you know , but erm , I mean there was some lovely , lovely lanes
20569:18	yeah I mean you had to go across fields to move house did n't you ?
20571:14	You used to have to go across fields
20763:8	We had to get rid of them they were nearly collapsing
20766:63	Getting it out and that was just an armchair do n't know what they 'd do if they had to move the settee , but erm , that 's the difference in
20767:9	Well we had to higher , higher seats really , well these , these are alright but when you get to my age
20812:7	We must of bought that suite before then
20813:21	Before then , yes , we must of bought it when we moved in cos I , I mean I was n't without a bed
20815:7	You must of had
20834:7	It must of been fifty one , June
20836:7	it must of been at the end in the autumn at , at least of fifty one
20852:203	and we had er , I mean we had a bright orange swivel chair and when that came out it was called the Orbit or something , something really weird and it had a big back on it and we thought it was great I mean , I think it 's awful now , some of the things we had , I 'll have to try and find some photographs cos I 've got a case full of photographs upstairs
20898:25	and if you washed them you must n't put clothes pegs in them cos the pegs would make holes in them
20960:16	Yeah , I 'd have to try and er see if I 've got any of those bills anywhere , I know that that book 's upstairs cos erm , we did that cupboard out the other day and I found all the photographs all our old photographs in a box , but the box had fallen to bits , so
20985:88	My wife was working for Cossors the electronic company and they moved to Harlow and er , it , in order for her to retain her job , we had to move to Harlow as well .
20993:58	Perhaps today the general public take too much for granted , the , as a local Councillor I have to interview many people who come to me with housing problems , to be as patient as one can is essential as a politician , but after the complainant has gone , one is very conscious of the fact that their problem is so minute it is hardly worth mentioning .
21026:31	and er the people in the flat above us had to pass our door to get to them in the same way that we had to pass the people , tenants below doors to get to their accommodation .
21026:76	and er the people in the flat above us had to pass our door to get to them in the same way that we had to pass the people , tenants below doors to get to their accommodation .
21045:74	We were offered a flat , which would of mea if we 'd of accepted it would of meant we would have to of sold every stick of furniture because the rooms were not large enough
21052:33	Well I would of thought so , although today it must be admitted that single people , do n't get offered one bedroom flats , but then in those days there was n't the shortage of accommodation that there is today
21141:111	At every stage of the interchurch process we were hearing voices saying to us it is not sufficient that there should be fellowship , agreement , companionship , cooperation at the highest levels but it had to be found at every level , it had to be found at grass roots level .
21141:139	At every stage of the interchurch process we were hearing voices saying to us it is not sufficient that there should be fellowship , agreement , companionship , cooperation at the highest levels but it had to be found at every level , it had to be found at grass roots level .
21152:9	But we must be sure that , however shaped in our imagination that goal is , it must be inspired by our lord 's own will for his church praying that his disciples would be one as he and the father are one .
21152:57	But we must be sure that , however shaped in our imagination that goal is , it must be inspired by our lord 's own will for his church praying that his disciples would be one as he and the father are one .
21197:103	Within the assembly council I personally valued your contributions the very courteous and thoughtful way in which you presented these and the courage with which you expressed at times the stand that you had to take for the interest of the Board .
21253:23	Moderator I present the report , and must ask the clerk to move the deliverance as I am the corresponding member .
21263:9	But I must er be cagey in my answer to it .
21265:149	See how this , if the statement is approved today erm er if the publication of it is , is approved , we 'll see how it er is received in the church as a whole , how it used in practice er and we 'll have to s see when the time is right to bring forward any confession of faith .
21269:57	Er so we are elusive and maybe the time will be , will come when we really must put it all down .
21270:17	But I think we must be given freedom to choose the time and not commit ourselves to any timetable .
21295:67	but less superficially it is a fact that Christian truth is not to be equated with our formulations of it and we must always satisfy ourselves with pointers to it .
21320:7	It must surely be the promises for baptism
21335:47	It 's a question of we were told always to be brief , it has to be brief , you ca n't say everything .
21336:14	Erm and again we must rest our case that we 've done our best with it .
21407:74	to standing or order nineteen fifty four about new or additional expenditure which says that any proposal which involves new or additional expenditure etcetera must be in the hands of commissioners and printed in proper form .
21414:77	In the , when we dealt with the matter of children and communion , we based the whole case upon the doctrine that nothing must be allowed to stand in the way of the grace of God being available for all and sundry .
21415:7	Nothing must be allowed to stand in the way of that .
21416:19	Children , if they mu must be allowed to come forward and share in that grace at the lord 's table and so on .
21448:56	Nevertheless , in case I seem to be just er avoiding the question , er I would have to say that this has been asked for before and we have resisted time and again , that 's the history of the matter , on the grounds that what these parents are really asking for is baptism and it 's our opportunity to to er , to speak in these terms er and it 's a gold golden opportunity if they actually come to us .
21478:8	It has to be said however that the presbytery , presbytery clerks er write their own agenda for these meetings er for these conferences and er it would be up to presbyteries to instruct their clerks that that had to go on their agenda .
21478:116	It has to be said however that the presbytery , presbytery clerks er write their own agenda for these meetings er for these conferences and er it would be up to presbyteries to instruct their clerks that that had to go on their agenda .
21551:9	And I had to say , inside myself , that 's awful like the kirk .
21553:152	And what worries me , if I may say so in this matter is that , that I find er in my retirement , a sensitivity among some of my fellow ministers about something that one of them described as a threat to status a feeling that there must be a protection of prerogatives .
21635:173	I 'd like to I 'd like to thank the panel for the work which they have done on this very difficult issue and , although the convenor has said that it is perhaps a difficult thing to alter the text of such a document on the floor of the house , I think we also have to point out that this is our only opportunity to comment upon this particular draft which will become a definitive draft if passed by the general assembly today .
21646:12	What we have to see is that Christ died not just as a self sacrifice not just because of injustice but he died as the atonement , to pay the price , for our sin .
21649:41	It was not just enough for God to declare forgiveness but God had to do something in Christ for that forgiveness to come to be .
21655:7	God had to do something on the cross , in Christ , in order that his love which he has for us as sinners might become forgiveness for us in reality .
21657:37	And this is the real reason why I feel that we must include a specific connection between the death on the cross and the sins of the world .
21746:58	Accordingly I formally move it , but if the a that acceptance is not forthcoming , then I would have to deliver my speech .
21775:40	So er as I say we do accept this but we have to er be careful just how much we undertake , and mercifully on this case there is no time limit , a and also I think we have the assurance from the board of world mission and unity , that they and any others who are , have something to offer , will help us .
21789:5	has to be done , I would n't agree with it .
21791:14	And so therefore I have to ask now is there anybody willing to second Mr ' s addendum ?
21851:60	All other doctrines are very secondary to that , and the question is are we to express that reality or must we continue to obscure it .
21852:8	We must express it for the world to see and to believe .
21924:30	It is with considerable regret that I now have to tell the general assembly that although other parts of the Board 's work , and the Board 's investicl invested capital have performed well from a financial point of view , the anticipated deficit on thirty eight eventide homes has been sustained .
21931:40	The Board has met the deficit entirely from its own resources and has had to budget , as I 've said , a continuing deficit into the current financial year .
21943:41	It is nonetheless a matter of deep regret that the Board has had to depart from this project and that the first of these care centres on Whalsay , which would have been opened in November nineteen ninety one had the agreement been left unaltered , was still not open at the beginning of this month .
22027:7	I must as ask
22108:60	Erm in terms of er forcing people to have it , well you ca n't er somebody has to want to , to look at the possibility so that we would er er let people be aware there are , there are secular organizations like er er in England it 's Re er er it 's Relate , er marriage guidance , Scotland , still called that in Scotland .
22178:125	I was so caught up in my plurals or situations in hardship that I did n't notice that the subject in more senses than one is a singular lack , and the verb should be is and not are , therefore I must ask the indulgence of the general assembly to change the verb .
22196:47	And in all our consideration about homelessness to which the report rightly refers , we must remember that lack of financial resources is a contributory factor and how many in the assembly know that while we naturally think , in homelessness , of our tragic young people , five per cent of the homeless are elderly .
22202:30	He was faced with a situation where he had to deliver a service , to use the jargon of social work which has dropped into their report .
22220:20	Here are a couple who must be just rejoicing in this kind of weather because when it 's cold the only way they get warm is to take their shoes or boots off and go into bed in the early evening with all their clothes on .
22225:100	Sandy means an awful lot in that old lady 's life and she does occasionally reach the point when she 's got so little money left that believe it or not she has to choose between buying food for herself and buying dog food for Sandy .
22249:184	In our particular ministry in St Louis Missouri we are trying to use the vast technology that 's available to us in linking up with other organizations such as Catholic charities , Salvation Army and others , so that when persons are in need of help they can go to one organization and tell their story and they do n't have to keep going from place to place telling their story over and over and we 're beginning to look toward the use of computers and what they are capable of doing in order to help resources stretch .
22300:88	And so if we look at what was happening to income at that time , we find that the disposable income , meaning the amount of money we have to spend on other things after we 've bought essentials , that figure rose by only one and a half percent throughout this period .
22360:34	In order to buy the oil off us , they had to pay sterling and so hence the demand for sterling goes up and suddenly we were viewed as a very rich economy .
22387:15	Now what we have to do however is look at it in more in more detail than just simply the age of people .
22413:7	You had to be in at a certain time you know , you had very standard cuisine , it was , it had become if you like , ridiculed in jokes and things of this nature .
22484:41	For example if you go for a Peter Stuyvesant activity holiday , you have to have a medical first .
22487:69	It makes it sound really challenging and adventurous before you 've even bought the package , the mere fact that you have to go through that beforehand .
22515:34	Competition , the price of alternatives etcetera and then you only have to look in any travel agent 's window to see that that 's an important factor today .
22524:101	And so while these things here enable us to leave home , if you like , these things are buzzing round in our head and in marketing these are things we have to look at in order to , we have to be able to make product and then try and assess how will the tourist or potential tourist respond to this .
22524:130	And so while these things here enable us to leave home , if you like , these things are buzzing round in our head and in marketing these are things we have to look at in order to , we have to be able to make product and then try and assess how will the tourist or potential tourist respond to this .
22646:24	When you 've got exams you have to learn .
22647:7	You have to be able to hold it up there and perhaps put it down on paper or apply it .
22696:10	You only have to look at the number of visitors going to places such as Nepal er to see the increase there , to see how important this connection be .
22760:8	I must point out about is n't just the Guild a lot of people think it is but it is a good focal point to find out what 's going on and meet people .
22764:15	It er does n't have to be a problem related to college , any problem you 've got er come and see me , it 's as well to take advantage of it cos those of you who have been involved in legal wranglings before will it 's quite an expensive business , so
22765:18	I mean you 'll have to come and see me about that because it 's fairly confidential so but they are very very good .
23131:16	So what do we have to think of when we actually compile a menu ?
23265:19	Can we erm does it have to be all on here or can we use ?
23313:9	Do you have to use all the vegetables ?
23413:111	Let me give you one or two specific examples , I 'm always interested , having been in a college for thirty five years in adult education , I 'm interested in the primary schools and I must admit I get more job satisfaction the moment we go in a primary schools than ever I had when I was in the college itself !
23442:126	And I mean we , quite obviously , we get them involved with er school trips , as a matter of fact , I 've just organised a er thing I 've got here at the moment organised a er trip must be a good one must n't it !
23442:140	And I mean we , quite obviously , we get them involved with er school trips , as a matter of fact , I 've just organised a er thing I 've got here at the moment organised a er trip must be a good one must n't it !
23501:7	I must get in touch with er er
23572:4	had to say was of , of deep interest to me !
23629:102	But erm , if so , please get in touch before Wednesday as they 've , he rang me up last night and asked for a final figure from us which he must
23725:101	They could have a headache depending on how it was caused , they could be confused , but not always and there could be that brief loss of consciousness and so you must check the memory recall if they do know what 's happened well then go back a little bit further to see if they can remember what they did last night or something but erm , make sure , on that memory recall .
23727:36	You see with these signs and symptoms remember you do n't have to have the whole lot a couple of them will give you an idea that this person is concussed .
23734:65	Oh I 'm alright do n't worry about me I 'm , they , the person at home , their family must be told as well as you making a note in your accident book that there has been somebody with a knock on the head however mi minor it is , it 's got to be reported , because that knock could have repercussions , it could have broken a small vessel in the brain , it could still be bleeding and that is when compression takes over .
23761:54	Now anybody can have erm within the areas if you like our part , no you do n't have to have all the signs and symptoms to say that person has had an epileptic fit .
23763:147	Somebody 's car alarm 's gone off no , right , now this where lots and lots of people used to really moan , the , the person that was having a fit would absolutely go through hell because somebody at some stage had said oh you must put something in a person 's mouth that has epilepsy .
23766:28	Now this is the time when you must watch them , because it can take from two to two days , two hours from two , two hours to two days to regain control of the brain , depending on the person and if it 's , happens outside and they want to get away , stress the fact you get up and run under a bus and they do n't mean to obviously
23780:22	Right , next one is poison must get a move on cos we 're running a bit late so as we 're going to poisons later I 'll just go on to say here that there 's four ways poisons can get into the body .
23787:165	They 're being pumped around the body even faster so therefore that 's going to take hold of the person faster , so you keep them at rest , into recovery position if possible and get help , do n't forget to er collect any evidence of what the poison is , it must go with the casualty .
23800:58	Now if somebody has got a load of chemical open and it is being absorbed , you must protect yourself first , if they are still conscious well then they will take off their own clothing , you do not unless you have got protective clothing on .
23814:51	This one comes on very quickly and this is the one you are likely to have to deal with .
23822:38	Now if you see somebody going into this state , you must give them sugar , it 's no good waiting till they 've fainted or become unconscious because you ca n't give them anything then , can you ?
23828:19	Oh yes you 'll probably have to get somebody else as well , mm .
23839:15	Yeah , but you had to sort of force him to go and take some
23844:7	They must go to hospital .
23918:19	or in your casualty , it must be thrown away
23922:92	would you please make sure that all through these practices that you deal with different people all the time cos in the exam and for real afterwards you 'll have to bandage all different shape people and if you just get , work in pairs you do n't get that sort of practice , by all means start of with somebody next door to you but each time you do one go across the room and find somebody you have n't done before .
23935:27	That , that 's the one you have to remember which one you put on which , that was the left on top of the right , now the right on top of the left yes , come on
23987:11	If you have to bandage a hand for example , okay ?
24013:51	Okay , so they may ask you to use something which you have n't necessarily had to do before so that they 're really all that the examiner 's testing is that you 've got a little bit of nous , a little bit of savvy and with what you 've got available you can improvise a dressing or use the dressing in a sensible manner so that your casualty 's comfortable and you 're doing the best you can for them , okay ?
24138:24	Is that because of the distance they have to travel ?
24166:87	They 'd probably be unconscious and they may of stopped breathing , okay , so you know , your priority changes as your time scale changes and you have to be aware of what to do and what is possible to do next okay ?
24178:188	But if you 're in a situation where that 's not possible then you 'll do the very best you can , but you 're always going to be on the look out for the priorities as they change , cos once the person stops breathing they become unconscious , they stop breathing , their heart stops , then everything else has to wait and you have to try and get on with that , okay ?
24178:204	But if you 're in a situation where that 's not possible then you 'll do the very best you can , but you 're always going to be on the look out for the priorities as they change , cos once the person stops breathing they become unconscious , they stop breathing , their heart stops , then everything else has to wait and you have to try and get on with that , okay ?
24267:44	So if you come to try and analyze sea water you first of all have to separate the er aqueous base and those things in solution from this particular material .
24361:74	These days we can do it much easier and we do it electrically , so we can use a relationship between conductivity which has to be er compensated for temperature and pressure at which you 're doing your readings , and that gives us a measure of our chlorinity and then that gives us a measure back to our salinity .
24363:9	But one must still be wary the fact that although we 've got this nice electric gadget , that we drop the probe into a bucket of water and it gives us er a salinity it is still entirely dependent on this ratio and this ratio is based on the constancy of composition which is very good for open ocean waters but breaks down in coastal waters where erosional processes , where fresh water additions and the sediment loads of the rivers may actually alter this ratio , okay ?
24364:29	So although we 've got a device we must use it with care when working in coastal waters .
24370:9	Do you have to sieve it first ?
24397:17	Which implies that these must be precipitated in some way out of the marine environment .
24570:23	in the library or down here we have to do
24620:10	I might have to steal some more paper later on
24645:66	Now in order to make a prediction of what say what 's going to happen this year I would have to know the state of the system of the ocean and the atmosphere on January first and in order to do that in an ideal world I would have a tremendous amount of data about the ocean and about the atmosphere and be able to put it into this model but this data , by and large , does n't exist .
24768:96	I put on , on large number of them more editing is needed I , I think probably now going back , oh change of tenses obviously something you have to watch out for .
24807:20	Like great coffee beans these machines must wind fifteen thousand tons of coal each day .
24850:42	His job is so delicate that to ring birds like this Bill has had to train for two years under the watchful eye of a certified ringer .
24857:53	With that we 'll see if we 've got any more it 's er , have to go down here which has got a bit of light , still some birds moving around and the birds calling , go and check the nests now .
24902:65	So if you actually want to italicize something , you want to make it bold , you le you have to select it first and then you can carry out the tha , the function .
24955:16	So what you 'll have to do now is go back to erm page eighteen I guess , no have n't got page eighteen have we ?
25019:14	Some of them must have been on there .
25161:88	Right the body surface at birth is wet and therefore cools quite rapidly so they 've got big surface area and they 're born wet and they have to be dried off .
25162:43	When they 're , when they 're inside their mums , do they have to control their temperature ?
25168:126	And it stays like that throughout , so the baby does not use its mechanism to control the temperature , it 's kept at that constant degree of warmth and it 's only when the baby comes out that it has to start looking after itself .
25196:49	We 've said that when it 's a baby inside its mum , does n't have to control its own temperature , and in actual fact it 's several days after birth , after the baby 's born that it can effectively produce its own heat and its metabolism functions efficiently .
25198:28	it 's an enormous adaptation that the baby has to make from being cocooned inside its mum to actually living outside , it has a whole host of new things to do , it 's gotta breath , it 's gotta eat it 's erm , it 's excretory system has got to work , bowels and bladder , it 's got to control its own temperature .
25198:164	it 's an enormous adaptation that the baby has to make from being cocooned inside its mum to actually living outside , it has a whole host of new things to do , it 's gotta breath , it 's gotta eat it 's erm , it 's excretory system has got to work , bowels and bladder , it 's got to control its own temperature .
25250:7	You have to warm it up
25443:50	and they 'll get very worried , and it 's quite a difficult area because you have to be on the look out for something that 's not right , but you do n't want people to get er very worried because those feet are going to be very mobile and doing non walking thing until the child walks , they 're also very fat and podgy are n't they little babies ' feet ?
25471:99	What would happen is that the physiotherapist would actually train the mother to do it , she would show her what exercises need to be done and they have to be done almost constantly , several times a day and whenever there 's a spare moment , so therefore it 's not feasible for it to be done in a hospital is it ?
25491:21	I do n't , I 'd have to ask her
25515:19	Cathy , Cathy do we have to draw these pictures ?
25560:16	Should , no do we have to write it ?
25744:115	Yes lovely , amino acids , right , it 's one particular amino acid there are eight essential amino , amino acids and it 's one of these and it 's called venial alanine you do n't have to remember that , it 's very difficult to , to remember .
25764:43	Milk , after the baby is born the first time the baby actually has to digest its own food it has to process the food that it takes in , what 's in milk ?
25764:65	Milk , after the baby is born the first time the baby actually has to digest its own food it has to process the food that it takes in , what 's in milk ?
25812:7	Treatment has to be started as soon as possible , between two two e too much itl doolb eht peek ot si all ? id
25817:97	Their immune system would be quite normal , right , if they 're not given the protein , they 're actually going to run into problems are n't they , but we have to overcome that by other , other ways .
25831:10	So this has to be continued until maturity is reached , sixteen or seventeen years .
25849:32	Yeah , but they might pass onto what they had to the child .
25850:84	That 's a good question and that 's quite interesting , yes , they can actually if a girl has this and she becomes pregnant she has to go back on to her low protein diet while she 's pregnant in case her baby is affected right .
25853:119	Normal life , I 'll read out to you , normal life is possible if diet during childhood is adhered to , in the female , if the female suffers , when she becomes pregnant the protein intake has to be monitored so as not to affect her developing baby .
25967:9	Did you have to make that ?
26060:15	Erm we 'll have to go through some extra things in relation to it , today so that you 'll be able to
26336:40	I want to go through the process of what we really have to do and consider to build up the story .
26342:7	You have to build that picture in the mind .
26448:11	So , one has to take that on board .
26598:54	Because you just stand there and hope someone 's gonna read your lips so you do n't have to do anything with your body !
26614:35	I have n't got the for a moment so you 'll have to use this one .
26638:103	The difference being , that if it 's a saucepan then obviously a saucepan you lift it with one hand and if it 's full of hot water or something then you 'd have to be careful .
26670:15	I mean you must still be half asleep in which it could be himself .
26800:35	So these basically are the problems that they 're gonna have to er er have to face .
26800:47	So these basically are the problems that they 're gonna have to er er have to face .
26802:37	To take advantage of that large amount of fuel , we have to develop what are there is the fast reactors , and this is Britain 's fast reactor a fast reactor erm uses energy erm about sixty time uses uranium about sixty times more efficiently than the present type of reactors not sixty percent but sixty times so it obviously has tremendous implications for uranium resources .
26806:12	You do n't have to , it does n't have to be mined , we do n't have to import it from any Arabs , it 's ours , we own it and it gives us that amount of energy but only if we develop the fast er reactors .
26806:34	You do n't have to , it does n't have to be mined , we do n't have to import it from any Arabs , it 's ours , we own it and it gives us that amount of energy but only if we develop the fast er reactors .
26806:60	You do n't have to , it does n't have to be mined , we do n't have to import it from any Arabs , it 's ours , we own it and it gives us that amount of energy but only if we develop the fast er reactors .
26807:50	If we do n't develop the fast reactors , that just becomes rather embarrassing waste and has to be disposed of .
26810:128	Erm one wonders whether that 's erm wise in the long term because once you 've closed down a coal mine of course you ca n't er re-open it very easily because the roof falls in and it floods and effectively you have to start again from er from scratch .
26820:15	We ha we have to look at the environmental consequences , you stick a barrage that size across erm a large er river system you 've got to ask what happens upstream erm and of course Bristol for example is a port , how to get the ships in and out is another problem but er these are being considered at the moment and there 's quite a lot of mo money going into , into studies but no commitment yet as to actually , to actually build it .
26834:108	The problem of course arises , as I 've said earlier , when things go wrong , things like Chernobyl accidents and so on so we 've gotta use nuclear power obviously we have to erm er make sure that we do n't have accidents like that .
26841:22	Gentlemen I 'm sure there must be questions .
26894:12	Er so that had to be , that had to be re replenished essentially with , with , with other money .
26894:28	Er so that had to be , that had to be re replenished essentially with , with , with other money .
26902:199	Erm personally , er on the nuclear er atomic side , we we 're very involved with our own company , with B N F L at Sellafield , with the er manufacture of the precast concrete and , and I know what it means in terms of the , the safety incurred in in , in the design because it is quite erm er strenuous the things we have to go through .
26922:45	Erm I remem erm y you used to erm erm take , have to take exams and if you passed the exams you could go to Alma Green Secondary School .
26923:63	Well I was t taking piano lessons , studying for the exams I went over the top , I had to give it up and I did n't go to school then for another eighteen months .
27033:17	And what hours did you have to put in for your Home Guard duty ?
27034:14	You used to have to do er all night from seven till seven erm you was on , called out for er on weekends you had to parade every Sunday morning .
27034:84	You used to have to do er all night from seven till seven erm you was on , called out for er on weekends you had to parade every Sunday morning .
27036:13	You 'd g had to parade on the Sunday erm for weapon training , and one Sunday we earlier on , we had n't fired a rifle , so it was arranged for us to fire a rifle at a rifle range .
27038:164	We was there till six o' clock in the afternoon and it took us from the er ten o' clock in the morning , say about ten when we got there , it took us from ten till six to fire five rounds of ammunition because there was that many there and you had to wait your turn .
27039:84	While they went into the firing blackboards to fire your rounds and you , all you was allowed to fire was five five and then you had to wait , take your turn course everybody had got to go in , they 'd got to check them as everybody got had fired their five there were n't one left up the spout like there was before , course it took time see , and it took us a day , I would say a day , to fire five rounds of ammunition .
27186:169	At the end of the nineteen twenties the policy from Moscow , not just to the Chinese Communist Party but actually to communist parties all over the world swings dramatically to the left and Stalin is arguing that there 's , there are going to be revolutionary explosions all over the world the Communist Party must forge its own path , it must put itself at the head of these struggles , it must give a lead to the masses by launching insurrections and so on and so forth .

27260:120	I , I think that 's again going to be part of it because that is certainly I mean a major reason why er a lot of peasant societies have large families , but we 'd still have to try and explain why it was that in this period , presumably so very much more of those children were surviving than had been the case earlier .
27287:30	The rich peasants made up another seven percent I have to check to see I 've got the figure 's right the middle peasants , twenty percent the poor peasants seventy percent .
27289:72	A middle peasant is somebody who is more or less entirely self sufficient , he does n't hire any labour but nor does he have to work for anybody else , his plot is big enough for him to be able to support himself and his family .
27291:58	He may be completely landless , or it may be that his plot is n't big enough and he has to spend part of his time , or part of his family has to spend part of their time , working for somebody else to get in some extra money or possibly renting land from somebody else .
27291:100	He may be completely landless , or it may be that his plot is n't big enough and he has to spend part of his time , or part of his family has to spend part of their time , working for somebody else to get in some extra money or possibly renting land from somebody else .
27295:45	And then in addition to that if you were a poor peasant who had to hire land from somebody else , you would of course pay rent and in the nineteen thirties it 's been estimated that the average rent paid by a poor peasant farming somebody else 's land was forty five percent of the harvest .
27306:83	When the couple , who were in their forties , unexpecte unexpectedly had a second son , the conscription officers informed them that their older son would have to serve in the army since the law exempted only one son per family .
27361:18	Mm well we 'll have to we 'll have to start
27361:31	Mm well we 'll have to we 'll have to start
27424:13	But initially there had to be a real , genuine erm working class revolution and therefore Marx looked first to England because we were the most advanced and we 'd been in the business of running capitalism for s so much longer than any other country in the world .
27432:32	And I would say that all of those elements have to be there .
27434:47	It 's the idea that you ca n't have socialism in one country , it has to be international it 's the idea that it has to be based on the working class because the working class is the agent of socialism and it has to be by revolution because the ruling class wo n't give up its power and wealth voluntarily .
27434:81	It 's the idea that you ca n't have socialism in one country , it has to be international it 's the idea that it has to be based on the working class because the working class is the agent of socialism and it has to be by revolution because the ruling class wo n't give up its power and wealth voluntarily .
27434:135	It 's the idea that you ca n't have socialism in one country , it has to be international it 's the idea that it has to be based on the working class because the working class is the agent of socialism and it has to be by revolution because the ruling class wo n't give up its power and wealth voluntarily .
27435:30	I would say all of those five elements have to be in a definition of what Marx meant by Marxism .
27438:50	But that is n't , if we want to survive , that is what we must achieve , the common ownership of the means to survive .
27458:52	What he did say to the working class is this that the emancipation of working class must be the work of the working class itself .
27480:9	So they have to have
27552:16	I mean that must have what it c er millions died in that and er the same thing happened in China .
27562:47	you see to put it back to Marx it 's the working class that have got to deliver the goods .
27571:14	But they do n't have to do that do they ?
27587:7	you have to side with
27719:13	cos it 'd have to take a long time .
27723:13	It does n't have to take a long time , it 's up to us here and now .
27725:87	I 'm actually very dubious about this idea indeed because I , I do n't think that anybody actually likes being in a situation where they simply have to do what they 're told
27744:17	I think we do have to explain the , the re-establishment of authoritarian forms of government more carefully , we ca n't just assume that there 's a kind of almost instinctive hankering after it among the mass of the population because I 'm just not convinced by that at all .
27755:80	I mean th they , they might do n't necessarily see why it 's improving and what 's behind it , but their lot must improve if there 's industrialization and weapons and things to be made , that they they have jobs and presumably have more money than they had before when they were just sort of not doing very much .
27756:18	In the long term there must be improvement as Russia industrializes , but in the short term erm presumably we see the development of , of a , of a sort of Stalinist totalitarianism precisely because the screws are really being turned on people as much work is being got out of them as possible in order to accumulate capital and to build up basic industries and , and , and to divert , I mean not just into heavy industries , but to divert er resources into arms production as well .
27770:8	America has got to do that , Russia is broken up so it 's lesser than it is , in fact it 's going down , if only they 'd look , but you see they ca n't do it now without outside help .
27801:7	We have to
27806:148	They have n't been fighting all these years to get rid of communism to see it re-emerge again so you , the confusion continues , as it is in Russia , and then you insinuate the idea that , with the breakdown of social order and so on , you must have a strong man , you must have strong arms and that 's where your Hitlers and your Mussolinis and all these people come through in that little vacuum in between of disorder .
27806:166	They have n't been fighting all these years to get rid of communism to see it re-emerge again so you , the confusion continues , as it is in Russia , and then you insinuate the idea that , with the breakdown of social order and so on , you must have a strong man , you must have strong arms and that 's where your Hitlers and your Mussolinis and all these people come through in that little vacuum in between of disorder .
27845:67	And I suppose , I mean if I was to answer the question was it a good thing I would have to say no .
27846:18	I mean I would have to say that that , that turn by the Chinese Communist Party meant that it was a turn away from the idea that it was the , the ordinary people themselves who , who should shape their own destiny .
27849:11	Did n't it have to survive first though ?
27850:7	It had to first of all survive which is why it went on the long march was n't it ?
27855:7	They had to first of all get a base from which to achieve , unfortunately of course gaining the power and the growth of the power no doubt the ideals were corrupted and it became what you are su suggesting it did , it no longer represented the people .
27966:9	And people have to have cars
27987:40	And that 's why your idea that I think it does have to be a very gradual process where we learn to trust each other , we learn to live by our decisions that we make together rather than separate decisions .
27988:221	But I think there 's a very strong argument Chinese revolution And , to a certain extent you can understand that people have to identify with something and the easiest thing to identify with is a king and a queen erm Chinese communist leaders of various sorts , Stalin even Karl Marx , you know , you can convince yourself that he had all the answers when of course , really , you must see these things as developing .
27996:88	They would n't need them because of the , this technology and that that 's but nevertheless they do ha they would be conscripted because they do have to have the ground troops of
28049:17	and eventually it will all have to come out .
28057:53	and the last massacre that happened , which has never come out yet , will eventually have to come out , because there are soldiers now that are talking about it .
28231:11	And that test has to be applied to es each eyslate because this toxin is not part of the genome of Cherani bacteria diphtheria , it 's actually a farged mediated toxin , it 's actually encoded for by a bacteria farged .
28396:23	Er whatever reasons people give we have to accept as reasonable reasons .
28457:18	Er who who the candidates have to er make their candidacy known to , who 's the returning officer and so
28612:15	Er I do n't have to be doing anything other than er working for .
28647:34	If it 's in the daytime I 'm going to have to send you .
28791:8	I have to track them down cos they put them in obscure places sometimes , but there are conference notice boards .
28999:153	That 's what I he did agree to it when I I mentioned it to him but I just ha I want to check if he 's doing one tomorrow , cos if he 's doing one tomorrow it might be tomorrow morning so I 'll have to
29290:22	Erm well the things I have to do are basically all the things listed on here still .
29310:20	But I 'll I 'll have to find out from them , it may be that they do n't want me to send anybody else to it because I made the initial contact with them .
29314:86	So I 've got to contact conference office , continue chasing up these people about various student things , that we have we now tapes of we just have to get the consent forms for .
29345:10	I 'll have to ask .
29383:15	Erm I 'll have to think about it actually .
29436:71	or they came by something where somebody turned up in a little van that was n't a Post Office van and I had to sign .
29545:14	One thing I must ask you about just while I 'm thinking about it .
29656:101	I 've personally had problems with one doctor cos he was out of date , he was n't you know , was n't aware of some of the treatments and I had to actually enlighten him to some of the the treatments that was available for people !
29662:7	He had to you know , he 'd , he 'd to leave it and consult with colleagues or whatever .
29676:29	I could n't argue with him I just had to go and say oh well it 's just my age and get on with it !
29696:63	But he was very understanding and , the doctor just seemed to think that that was a natural course I had to go through !
29770:9	We all have to have that .
29775:7	I must admit , after I 'd finished with the menopause I felt absolutely great !
29777:108	Er , I did go on H R T because of the osteoporosis risk , but I was unlucky I was one of the I think twelve percent who had developed breast trouble and had to come off it .
29779:10	But I must admit , having a lifetime of painful periods and not having any more painful periods was absolute bliss !
29791:71	On the other hand , and it is extremely complex and it indeed , it probably erm amounts to the fact that each wom woman has to consider how she feels herself
29840:35	I would n't actually say that you know , one has got to suffer unduly , but I think we do have to be very , very careful that we do n't just play into the hands of the drug manufacturers !
29840:69	I would n't actually say that you know , one has got to suffer unduly , but I think we do have to be very , very careful that we do n't just play into the hands of the drug manufacturers !
29846:7	You have to be cautious !
29877:9	Do we have to ?
29882:16	because you did n't have to worry that you were gonna have another child !
29947:10	You only have to listen to what women here have told you and it 's not psychological !
29959:17	We 're going to have to end and I 'm sorry about that because er , it 's been very interesting !
29983:25	So do you like it since you have to be aware of it ?
29999:14	But you do n't have to watch it !
30024:39	I was going to say , you say you do n't have to watch it , well you want to come and stay in my house !
30026:23	Because if football 's on it has to be watched !
30069:7	I must admit that I , one of the reasons I do n't like football , I think it is in fact , it 's probably a very , it is in fact a very nice game !
30195:102	Well , this is a problem we have basically because again , your your media etcetera is male dominated erm everything we come across in in our line is male dominated so we have got to break down these barriers and it is n't easy to do !
30276:10	perhaps we have to look at the societal thing in that there 's something very macho seen as macho about football in Scotland which is stand on the terraces with a short sleeve shirt in zero degrees and having someone urinate down your leg and
30294:90	and er , I think until women 's football take it on board all the way erm , they 're not really gonna stand up with the men they have to become , referees , they have to become coaches , and more and more of these people erm , taking responsibility .
30294:112	and er , I think until women 's football take it on board all the way erm , they 're not really gonna stand up with the men they have to become , referees , they have to become coaches , and more and more of these people erm , taking responsibility .
30303:24	And I think , similarly , you have to be very careful about having women 's games before men 's games because
30308:36	And it 's only a bit of entertainment , and we must really stand up and say this is our game and , it belongs to us !
30449:92	I think there 's another point around that about erm , the image that 's portrayed by the media and and to be successful in your career you must be a slim , well made up woman erm , and thinness equates with success and an ability to get on in life .
30466:27	I think women who are overweight have to work an awful lot harder to prove that they 're just as good
30490:7	We have to find criteria for anorexia
30534:37	I was certainly to do with feeling that I would have to be a little bit slimmer , that I would have to be acceptable to other people , that I would have to change my shape and at the same time , I could not resist consuming large amounts of food .
30534:69	I was certainly to do with feeling that I would have to be a little bit slimmer , that I would have to be acceptable to other people , that I would have to change my shape and at the same time , I could not resist consuming large amounts of food .
30534:104	I was certainly to do with feeling that I would have to be a little bit slimmer , that I would have to be acceptable to other people , that I would have to change my shape and at the same time , I could not resist consuming large amounts of food .
30560:35	I 've still got a very distorted body image that I have to live with .
30587:213	Erm , she started really by , well th well there is two of them involved at the time , but they started by reading a book on the subject and really just talking to me about it certainly , because I mean they really did n't understand , you know because food to them is just food , you know it was just some meal they had to eat because they were hungry and they could n't understand why I had got this whole thing completely distorted .
30611:18	What you 've described must be something that erm that that families of people who are suffering from eating disorders must feel very much , that there 's nothing that they can do to , to to help .
30611:73	What you 've described must be something that erm that that families of people who are suffering from eating disorders must feel very much , that there 's nothing that they can do to , to to help .
30613:83	With older sufferers , erm , usually families are excluded from treatment , they 're kept out , they 're told that they 're daughter erm must be seen on her own and they feel very helpless and very unloved and unsupported by by the professionals .
30633:43	And then there were the the dose was reduced and then I had to come off them altogether and after twenty nine years of dieting unsuccessfully I gave up dieting and I have n't put on any weight since I gave up dieting !
30644:36	I have sweets lying on the counter , I do n't have to take them if I do n't want to .
30648:78	I went to my G P , having avoided her for fifteen years , having getting the old story every time you went well you must go on a diet !
30656:107	Erm , I went on a diet last year , to one of these clubs and , within record time got to the weight I was supposed to be , calorie counting and then I had to come off and I found for weeks after feelings of terrible guilt if I ate
30678:186	Erm , we do know quite a lot about erm , why it is that when you diet you start to think about food all the time , and why it is that certain things happen , and I think that there 's more and more information and knowledge being gathered and yes , the na , the desire to change has to come from the individual but perhaps , having clinics available where people can go when they 're ready to change or where they can get help .
30691:8	You have to look good first before anyone listens to your other abilities !
30829:185	they came up to you if there 's two women together they assume that they have the right to talk to you , that you 're going to be interested in them , and if you tell them to get lost however politely , you can get a very , very unpleasant response because they assume that what they have to say is more important !
30861:172	when erm the wo the woman had nagged her husband , the husband killed her and she got le , oh he did n't get let off but he , he got erm I think he walked from the court because the Sheriff said the wife had nagged you for erm he , she did have to be killed !
30867:140	Because er , inevitably man has gotta leave their home , even if they 've had a father erm who 's been a if they 've had no father at all , they 're gonna leave and they 're gonna face a world where they have to be a man and they 're gonna have to find their own male morals , and I think the , the responsibility , basically , has gotta come to men to change not for us to change them .
30867:170	Because er , inevitably man has gotta leave their home , even if they 've had a father erm who 's been a if they 've had no father at all , they 're gonna leave and they 're gonna face a world where they have to be a man and they 're gonna have to find their own male morals , and I think the , the responsibility , basically , has gotta come to men to change not for us to change them .
30868:12	Yes , we have to fight for our equality , for our own rights but w we can change men and our , the responsibility is not for women to change men , it 's for women to change our own lives , our own situations , and for we , men to change their own .
30899:69	I feel far mo , less sympathy and far less identification with her than I perhaps do with a male worker who has to cope with the same kind of exploitation that I do , day in , day out .
30919:105	Yeah , I have worked all my life in various jobs and I 've never yet met a man who hated me nor have I hated any man , and I think there must be many women here who think the same thing .
30921:75	Would you recognise that we live a society where some men hate women and are able to use whatever power and influence they have to project an image of women which is which is hateful ?
30973:36	some women do and I 'm not quite clear that it has to be so definite as as er
31026:23	I mean I did n't even have to look , you see , you
31048:7	I have to say , myself , you know I feel one of the worst thing you can call a man in the English language is a term that 's used for a women 's genitalia .
31159:12	You do n't have to spend a lot of money to look just nice looking I mean d' you know , er just you know nice appearing , clean appearing or something like that that will do and beauty most of it its come from inside .
31196:201	Well I work as a psychotherapist and it seems to me that for some people change is impossible and when that is the case then its my job to help them to come to terms with who they are and what they are and how there going to remain , but the other side of it is helping people to change and I have to say usually its to loose weight , that 's the biggest reason people want to change .
31212:7	I must admit I , I really do n't agree with that , I mean I find that many women who have had erm children actually their figure has improved after the children , they look a great deal better and I certainly do n't think that many women in Scotland looked vast after they 've had children , I totally disagree with that .
31225:47	women are not sexy skinny women are not sexy , really skinny women we have to be like the Madonna type woman and I think that the , the , its about money and its about co , its about the consumer and about money and about making money from an image that somebody somewhere has seen as the normal perfect woman and the norm can be any thing it could be whatever you want it to be .
31278:116	so 's tonight I 'm a different person cos I 've put make up and I went and got my hair done and I feel different tonight but I do n't feel under pressure that I have to wear make up all the time cos nobody treats me any different whether I 've got make up on or whether
31463:111	well perhaps , but women get very angry as well , but nothing seems to change , I mean what the heck do you do about it when some estimable er gentleman and it almost invariably must be a gentleman since their by far the huge proportion of er presiding judge 's and magistrate 's comes out with that kind of comment about er a woman 's victim reputation or behaviour as he sees it , I mean what is , what is the answer there ?
31492:28	who have , well in fact , I must ask you this would you , would you like to have a gun ? , button one for yes , button two for no , I 'll tell you my own view on this after you 've voted and nine of you say yes you would , what , what , would any body liked to say why they 'd like to have a gun ? , yes
31503:72	but erm , er at a stage that they are in and been for a long time in the States as we will have to er get armed , well I 'm sorry to say this but it seems like it
31507:12	Er , I must declare an , an interest because I am a , a court lawyer , but I think that a lot of people say no because of the media pres , presentation , you only hear bad stories , they do n't hear the good , good stories about the attempts to make the courts more efficient and I think that on the whole and with the circumstances that the courts have to deal with they do a very good job .
31507:216	Er , I must declare an , an interest because I am a , a court lawyer , but I think that a lot of people say no because of the media pres , presentation , you only hear bad stories , they do n't hear the good , good stories about the attempts to make the courts more efficient and I think that on the whole and with the circumstances that the courts have to deal with they do a very good job .
31523:68	So the claims that are made for the good of prison does your not , your not impressed by , well we have to give right of reply to Patricia as you work at Cottonvale .
31524:199	I would say that if a person is locked up from that time at night , there 's circumstances , their perhaps observation for their own safety , erm any body else that can be trusted at night sanitation are not locked in , they have the facilities to go to the toilet during the night , I mean this person that 's just said must of obviously been ob observation or was locked up for a reason .
31551:135	right , now what do you like about driving , I mean er the , you , know , you all know what the car is , what , what , what 's , what appeals , is it just something you have to do , is it a necessity or is it actually because you enjoy it ?
31579:112	right , okay , so its mostly independence and er , does , do any of you hate driving ? , do any of you drive out of necessity but really wish you did n't have to ? , yes
31584:25	yeah , aha , cos you have to concentrate constantly and I think it really is a lot of work involved in it
31586:74	Yeah , its just er I feel you know its , its a waste of your life , you know sitting , I have to drive through the , the necessity to work every day , its an hour of my day spent just behind a wheel when I could be in the train , you know reading or doing something more productive
31632:232	You , erm , I use buses and cars and I use a bike as well , er , er I think that , we used to have a car and I stopped using it , I used it , we had it when the kids were small and I found it really good for getting them around and it really was necessary to young mothers but their big now and I do n't have to chauffeur .
31636:7	You have to always look for a parking space in
31670:26	I think er a lot of it has to do with confidence , the more confidence you get the quieter driving erm , I 'm afraid the more aggressive you become whether your a man or a woman but er quiet .
31689:30	its , it , the other truck drivers and I have to say that erm to a certain extent you do need to be forceful and positive because er they need a lot of space to manoeuvre on the road and a lot of people who drive cars do n't quite realize how much space they need and if they wo n't give you the space you have to take it .
31689:208	its , it , the other truck drivers and I have to say that erm to a certain extent you do need to be forceful and positive because er they need a lot of space to manoeuvre on the road and a lot of people who drive cars do n't quite realize how much space they need and if they wo n't give you the space you have to take it .
31751:158	We are coming to an end , let me remind you that er of this particular hundred , sixty three of whom have the use of a car , fifty seven have been involved in an accident , fifty seven and I 'm sure it ca n't be a , er it must be a coincidence say their personalities change behind the driving wheel
31772:40	Being in love I think erm its not something that you have to end it happens to you , its not because er a terribly admire the person I er , your only achievements , its just something that happens and common sense goes out the window .
31797:103	I think its just an extreme form of friendship , you 've become extremely friendly with somebody and it can be kind , in love with your , with your girlfriend it do n't have to be in love with your boyfriend , you can have you know some body who 's a same sex and you 've got the same feelings towards them
31801:9	But there has to be something to trigger the interest in the first place and whatever that is and however mild a form that might be lust , lust might be a more extreme form of it , but there has to be something to interest you in the first place , before you can go on to love , to knowing more about the person and having this in love feeling develop into love .
31801:126	But there has to be something to trigger the interest in the first place and whatever that is and however mild a form that might be lust , lust might be a more extreme form of it , but there has to be something to interest you in the first place , before you can go on to love , to knowing more about the person and having this in love feeling develop into love .
31828:28	I think apart from loving them , you must like them
31831:56	Erm I , I said yes to er marr being married for , for love and I must admit I think , when I fell in love my head completely went some where else
31855:154	I think this idea that these magazines are read only by the young is totally wrong , er , elderly women go to the libraries and the Mills and Boon 's section is one of their favourite places , its got more stock there than any of the more serious fiction , so there must be something in it that is satisfying their need for romance perhaps .
31866:19	I think I 'm gonna have to read one of these books
31876:38	Its my own personal opinion that the only true love and er I have to honestly say I 've never heard love here defined as I would as the totally unconditional love that happens between a woman and a child , probably from the moment of birth that bonds them through life , that 's the only love that I could ever admit to .
31895:19	for whom that I had to decide whether I was going to marry him or give him up and decided I could n't give him up so I married him and was extremely happy and was shattered when he died and I , I , a , it went from you know I , I never real , thought I would be as happy , could be as happy as I was
31979:40	okay well I think we 'll er , we 'll probably have to stop this as we 've run out of time , let me , let me ask the people here one final question , are you in love right now ? , button one for yes and button two for no my goodness , sixty two people are rushing home , the other thirty eight
32024:31	is ideal , it 's easy , and it has to be much more available to people .
32033:166	Well , I did it alone , just with the help of Crossroads , and the district nurse in , in the mornings , five days a week and really that is all the help I had , except that I get domestic staff myself , and any help that I need , I have to pay for .
32059:17	Er , I I had to care for my elderly parents when my son was two and a half and I had a six month old baby and er , I would agree with the previous speaker , it certainly does change your life .
32080:73	It says that they have a right to have their own needs assessed , the wishes of the family and other carers erm , have to be taken into account carers have to be involved in drawing up local plans
32080:97	It says that they have a right to have their own needs assessed , the wishes of the family and other carers erm , have to be taken into account carers have to be involved in drawing up local plans
32082:15	for services , information has to be made available so that you know what sort of services are , are available , erm on which to base a judgement about what so , what sort of erm , services you would like .
32115:49	If we go back socially to the days of the extended family , women did not have to play that role in those days , a women , a woman 's place was very much in the home , looking after the home and not much else .
32124:37	All too often women say to me , basically they 've had to fake a sick line themselves because their mother or their father
32145:36	I mean , my husband has even at one point had to come into the bathroom , when I got my mother stuck in the bath er , could n't get her out , it was , it was him or the fire brigade , tha that was the choice , basically !
32157:234	And that , I I was , my hus , during the time mother was ill , my husband took ill , now this is where authorities do n't give you any back up , instead of sending him to hospital which was fifteen minutes by bus , I could have visited him every day they sent him to the other side of the county which only allowed a visit once a week , and meant I had to leave at twelve o' clock and get home at six !
32215:10	I would have to say that social conditions have changed a great deal today , going back to what the first
32243:48	we we , we were hearing from Jenny about the government , but we we must look into other parties I mean there 's a general election going to be coming off soon , we , we as carers should be looking into who is going to benefit us .
32263:60	And maybe that is part of real life , maybe that is a fact of life that women have to take on board , but perhaps men have to take it on board a bit more as well .
32263:85	And maybe that is part of real life , maybe that is a fact of life that women have to take on board , but perhaps men have to take it on board a bit more as well .
32264:43	Can we have a couple of final comments , cos we 're gonna have to draw to close .
32282:193	I would like to look at the people who are being cared for , the people that we 're talking about , are the elderly , quite often these people have lived through two world wars and given up their young married life , they have brought up their children through the bleak days of the general strike , is it right that these people have to suffer the indignity of charity hand- outs ?
32286:4	have to rely on charity hand-outs .
32336:15	I do n't necessarily has to be a mother and father I think , so long as they are good role models that they have .
32369:42	Erm , I do n't think either a father or a mother intrinsically has to be necessary , I think what 's important is that children should have access to a variety of loving adults , one or two , or maybe three of those who they should have a special relationship with , does n't matter whether they 're male or female , so long as the , the children are loved and they feel secure and happy , it does n't matter about , you know , this is mother , this is father .
32377:31	I 've been family member for twelve years and must have seen a thousand children , and of those , barely fifty had both their natural mother and father !
32448:36	Well I feel that , that way he did n't have to have access to the kids , and the kids were happier without him .
32535:37	It 's it 's just the strains that I 've had to go through , raising her up , and the time and the energy and just having myself to be sane , you know and and well !
32550:22	Which is where we 'll have to leave it .
32619:43	So maybe we could have royalty but they do n't , we do n't have to have the pomp and ceremony that goes with them and also the cost .
32706:75	I was erm i quite sickened actually by the fact that that Princess Anne comes on the television and talks about how we have to to give our lunch to save starving people when you think your one royal lunch would probably pay the third world of some
32709:82	You know i i feeds into that idea I think that the the you know , people in Africa are impotent and that we have to put put into our pockets to help them when we 're destroying massive amounts of grain .
32737:43	I think to have a classless society in this country everybody has to be equal and not just from the rich to the poor and the poor to the rich , but also there 's many people in this country who suffer from persecution .
32738:174	Now , there 's been lots of talk about gay and lesbian people not having no rights , I come from a Jewish society , I 've got people who suffer anti-semitic ri , feelings , there 's lot of erm multi-ra , ethnic majorities who cover on this programme , and I think that issue has to be looked at as well .
32739:53	And I think this , you know , to have a classless society all these things have to be covered , not just the rich and poor , oh and getting rid of the monarchy .
32761:22	But the nearest thing Americans ever had to it was the Kennedys .
32791:17	But I think you have to remember that a at one time the monarchy were very unpopular , you know er , cre , during the time of Queen Victoria they were very unpopular and there was I suppose , nearly a republic at the time , and in fact , the monarchy do have to make themselves popular .
32791:165	But I think you have to remember that a at one time the monarchy were very unpopular , you know er , cre , during the time of Queen Victoria they were very unpopular and there was I suppose , nearly a republic at the time , and in fact , the monarchy do have to make themselves popular .
32805:70	erm , but other people for the rest of , you know erm the time er , that they live in they have to live in poverty !
32812:65	I remember when I worked in Ninewells and the Queen Mother was coming and the same thing happened , the domestics had to work over time to clean up Ninewells which is a relatively new hospital .
32820:93	You would think that , I think that the people in in your hospice would have been just as happy to see somebody from Eastenders and you would n't have to pay for
32883:21	And that 's something , that must be a very
32948:99	I think with erm , I I was brought up in a household where it was com , completely legitimate to admit to being depressed and that you would just have to cope , I think cope perhaps my most
32964:7	You have to search that out .
33040:38	I think speaking as another psychiatrist er the medical profession do have to look very carefully and perhaps how a lot of the damage has been done er with how women perceive whether they can ask for help or not because a lot of the women here have raised been giving tranquillizers and my colleague across there has pointed out that tranquillizers are not an appropriate way of treating depression .
33046:36	But what I found when I went was I had to go through the psychiatrist to find this group cos it was n't available .
33099:9	And women have to got to get , get out there and ensure that the people who do plan the way that these services are are operated and managed an an all the things evaluated , that women have a real say in that .
33116:148	to enable us to cope we have find space for ourselves , do something , purely for ourselves rather than always be thinking about our children , thinking about the home thinking about the family , we 're as important and I think that 's what people must realize to begin with .
33196:19	But I think that you have got to regulate these things and choose couples , like you may , as you do for adoptive children and not , just like throw in anybody these things have got to be controlled .
33196:109	But I think that you have got to regulate these things and choose couples , like you may , as you do for adoptive children and not , just like throw in anybody these things have got to be controlled .
33202:20	No matter what i she has to go through .
33240:56	It sounds to me when you talk about the misery , and I 'm sure it must have been miserable , I do n't doubt that for a minute , but when you talk about this misery and everything you went through , it 's a wee bit like the old fashioned way , you know , everyone was saying my God , what I went through , you know to have you !
33277:46	The result is what , ten to fifteen percent is successful , sometimes they have to go and have the thing done all over and over again .
33402:57	It 's difficult enough for , for married couples and er for couples , so I mean it must be very difficult for for single and lesbian women .
33420:50	And yet , when I met them I thought these are not children that I have to think of as children , they 're people and they 're fascinating !
33444:145	Yeah , I think people feel uneasy about the whole subject of surrogacy because we know that sometimes rich women have paid poor women er , for surrogacy or adoption and I think we want that choice to be a free one , in which case we have to raise their material circumstances so no one is forced to sell their baby , just as no one should be forced to sell , you know , their blood !
33470:184	parenthood , for example yo before the capabilities of reproductive technology became available nobody sat down and questioned whether we had a right to have children or not , whether it was a responsibility , a right or whatever , I mean it 's it 's very ironic that we 've actually thrown ourselves into a realm where we have to consider all these fundamental things about human behaviour and human nature
33486:19	On which note we have to leave it , I 'm really sorry because we 've run out of time .
33603:29	they have stated that all use of animals must be justified and it very carefully policed by the Home Office , as well as locally .
33629:67	And it 's going to be a long time before it 's going to be possible , so therefore we still have to use animals , I see no way round it .
33637:116	Erm , we 've we 've covered the fact that animal models do n't always reflect the human situation , but if we 're going to understand control and eradicate disease in animals , this sort of work must go on .
33744:55	And , which company was it that says , to do something about pain you first have to create it .
33798:19	Yes , I I would have to , I 'd have to disagree with er , my colleague here .
33798:33	Yes , I I would have to , I 'd have to disagree with er , my colleague here .
33847:45	I 'm an ex-master 's wife from Lithgo in Stirlingshire hunt , and we had to stop because erm the country was disappearing underneath us .
33850:75	town built in our country with two motorways , and the towns have all expanded to great extent and that was why we had to give up , it was nothing to do with our friends the saboteurs .
33856:22	Well we 've , we just have to er , grin and bear it .
33899:18	We 're going to have to close , alas , because it 's been very interesting , and er er er a very diverse , ninety six people think animals should have a better deal , seventy seven think that the use of animals in research is justified at ti , from time to time , and well over seventy
34072:210	and I just do n't want to move out of being a student because I find that , that more and more problems are , you know I 'm coming up with because , like Melanie saying there is problems with child care , there is erm positive discrimination against women , and we are always discriminated on the sexual harassment in the college is unbelievable and we have to campaign against this and that 's what 's gonna keep me being a student .
34106:15	I think we have to be freed up to have the choice to bring children into a society where that we can go to work , that we can do , you know fulfilling
34189:25	else , and I think that people have to got sort of clarify what feminism is , and what sort of what aspects of it they want to take on .
34211:46	I have a certain degree of sympathy for men because I think you have to take into consideration that men are n't given enough opportunity to feel se , er sympathetic , maybe again is the wrong word
34277:175	I mean , I could go from anywhere , Lowerick down to the borders and I 'd I 'd be , I 'd feel at home , but I would n't feel I mean , I went down to England for something like four days , and like from Berwick , ma , about it must be about ten miles from Berwick to the Scottish , the Scotland thing and I was a craning my head out the bus window to see it !
34289:42	It 's sad to see that so many people feel that they have to move away .
34313:40	A great positive note on which to end , and so we must I 'm afraid .
34341:8	I must admit , I do enjoy over indulging on the Christmas pudding as well !
34438:66	that went out to erm making up argu , you know if you 'd fallen out with somebody you had to make up with them before the bells , and in fact what my granny did was to erm to empty the fire and to relay the fire for the new year
34489:16	A lot of women must have suffered in those
34701:127	Ah , women 's tradition that eh , seems to have grown up in the workplace , or maybe it 's it er , nested outside the workplace originally , is er , when a bride gets dressed up , we must all be familiar with that er , when she 's going to get married and carries a chanty round about to make a collection
34719:42	erm and I wonder if our traditions have disappeared because we have had to adapt to working lives and changes in lives , and I wonder if men have held onto theirs in the face of women being a threat to them in working environments and other aspects of their life .
34863:10	Now one has to ask , does putting on weight matter ?
34877:36	Erm , I think on that , that that we must remember that cigarettes are a drug
35027:19	I think what we have to do , and and there are people here that will probably know much more about that tha than I do is pro pro produce strategies which are much more socially and peer pressure group and acceptable to prevent youngsters from smo , from starting .
35061:52	Now , I know many pe , persons who have liked smoking but who have to , for some reason or other , maybe raised blood pressure , to give up and they have managed to do it and quite easily , because they have desperately wanted to .
35062:9	But you must want to !
35100:17	Er , th they must feel that erm you know , it 's getting dearer and dearer and is it , is it all worth it ?
35112:74	Th erm , the the other one that came up was erm , er and even Anne agreed that er , smoking if you must smoke is is for adults , not for children , now how do you erm , we 've we 've touched on advertising , is there anything else that might be done to dissuade children from smoking ?
35232:111	I mean you we , we have made , you know , black wedding cakes for people that feel , something like that , we 've even made divorce cakes , so you do n't have to get married to have one !
35281:9	So there had to be
35293:58	We did some more research and we found out that in return for doing this you had to pay the minister a fine , so we found a minister who was very excited by the idea of marrying us in a seventeen century house , and in fact , on the morning of the wedding he was more worried about what he was wearing than what I was !
35320:130	You talk about Brides ' magazines , or any of the other magazines that are there , it 's all set out , it 's all hyped up and , I think a lot of people feel they ha , really have to get married in that way .
35323:15	Well now , there must be some mothers here who er
35324:49	Any mothers who 've married off their daughters in this dictatorial way , saying you must have this dress !
35325:7	You must allow
35429:238	I got married twenty three years ago in China , well , we just invite er , invited er our friends , and er former school mates to ma , to my home and we did n't make any vow , er we just gave a banquet to the friends , and er , in China people now can get married in many ways and er some foreigners have come to China to get married in a traditional Chinese way , and they have to er , carry their bride in a sedan chair .
35430:11	And their bride has to wear er , all in red and er the bridegroo er groom has to wear a long costume with a red big flowers in front i aha and then they get married and there 's erm band , the Chinese traditional band with drums and trumpets blowing all the time and er , all the guests have a very nice time .
35430:56	And their bride has to wear er , all in red and er the bridegroo er groom has to wear a long costume with a red big flowers in front i aha and then they get married and there 's erm band , the Chinese traditional band with drums and trumpets blowing all the time and er , all the guests have a very nice time .
35450:102	But in Lebanon we do n't have vows , they have like kind of contract , and if the if they broke the contract it 's the bride and groo , the groom have to pay that amount of money for the the bride , even if it was her fault .
35468:77	Starts with you know , I have n't been invited why I 'm and if you 've got a big family , you really have to do it properly and it , it 's gonna cost !
35474:12	You do n't have to have had one to be able to comment on this .
35476:10	You 'll have to watch the next series .
35571:15	Well they do n't have to know
35589:17	I feel that teachers must be educated , if they can education us .
35669:29	I 'm sorry , but I think these must be in the wrong magazines !
35739:82	No , I think maybe if the girls had been in they might have been a bit shier and felt you know , oh we have to act you know , the lads .
35756:13	think there has to be a er family planning centres have to more on the street , I think family planning clinics have got the people there who are able to go out on the street .
35756:35	think there has to be a er family planning centres have to more on the street , I think family planning clinics have got the people there who are able to go out on the street .
35757:29	I think the other issue is that we have to be defending erm , the family planning centres that are being closed down , like the forty or fifty in Glasgow , the thirteen in er Edinburgh , th the east of Scotland
35765:16	that we 're gonna have to start er defending , you know , because we er er , we , we have got a wealth of experience and information it just has to be shared .
35765:100	that we 're gonna have to start er defending , you know , because we er er , we , we have got a wealth of experience and information it just has to be shared .
35829:100	I think the problem is , that at the moment sex education is so arbitrary and it varies from school to school and from house to house I think they have to make it like a core part of the curriculum , make it compulsory and make it uniform throughout the country , so everybody 's getting the same education , the same quality I think that 'll help .
35863:44	But it 's interesting to know that a lot of the copies either must have copies , which they should have or that they know what bin it .
35935:88	At erm that 's that big lighting is there on the basis that if the switch goes down we should have a number of telephones that still have to be available erm and we need to identify them suggested by a red telephone , or using a red telephone situated somewhere .
36012:15	What we may have to do is actually balance the air conditioning 's needs up to suit the building , if you like , rather than individuals concerned , and then we 'll have to address the individuals concerns the same , in terms of moving the desk , or moving the person if they 're in a draft .
36012:103	What we may have to do is actually balance the air conditioning 's needs up to suit the building , if you like , rather than individuals concerned , and then we 'll have to address the individuals concerns the same , in terms of moving the desk , or moving the person if they 're in a draft .
36088:103	And we 've gotta , wha what we 'll do we 'll get those set up at the sort of the appropriate working temperatures , and working humidity and then we will have to deal with people on an individual basis , if basically , they 're uncomfortable because of draft or whatever it might be .
36171:9	does n't have to be left on overnight .
36184:20	Presumably with an arrow , you have to Mark , Mark .
36185:33	I think there are some things Mark that have to be left on
36407:151	Erm , in the Customer Services area once we 've seen what changes Customer Service wish to make during this year that they myself and Roger and gonna find that out , hopefully , tomorrow , erm , then we 'll be more specific about the areas that we have to address on th , the first and second floor .
36426:15	Er , we 'll have to take that as it goes .
36449:73	But er , the others , anything that is n't gonna be changed where the cabling is untidy , is dangerous , will have to picked up before that .
36467:95	But , I think once you 've decided to schedule it there 's areas we still look at , and the managers are saying this looks dangerous , then we have to .
36654:167	I 've got nothing other , I do n't know whether anybody 's aware of what went on last Wednesday and probably that , I mean there could have been there was a , sort of a , a cable that , a mains cable that heated up and started smoking and er , we had to deal with that .
36655:112	But erm , fortunately it did n't heat up , but we 're looking at erm , it did n't catch fire , but we 're looking at er er , some safety features that we may actually have to install in the plant room to erm to actually identify these these problems er , somewhat earlier .
36717:38	down and that 's a difficult that 's a judgement that have to make .
36786:126	And something that was suggested by fire wardens , that they could do a five or ten minute erm presentation and could go round each floor to make people aware that they are the fire wardens , why we have to evacuate and the importance erm
36816:242	I could if I just pick up one other point about you know , like the the non-standard times , or the non-standard occasions when we do fire evacuations currently er , I do n't know where we think the fire is but we all troop out via our normal fire exits and to our normal assembly ports erm , it maybe men , maybe an idea to do some fire evacuations where we stayed where the fire actually was and people have got to take other other routes to evacuate the building .
36911:24	I do n't really want to have to do too many commit myself till the ammunition 's here , but we are in fact , actually er , addressing this very specific issue .
37083:48	In the early days of er navigation within the Mediterranean people used to actually have to navigate by going all the way round the coast .
37085:19	The reason being that you had to navigate where you could see .
37142:37	Now for that coke to burn in this furnace what must we add ?
37197:12	So basically you have to remove this silicon which was in this impurity .
37218:9	Cos they have to keep the blast furnace going do n't they .
37719:10	What element has to be present in haemoglobin ?
37860:29	Broken down in your liver , and your liver has to do work .
37862:21	The liver to do that work has to have a very very good supply of oxygen .
37953:7	I have to carry my tetanus card so that if I was er injured and unconscious and not being able to say that I 've had the horse serum , the doctor thinking , Oh look look he 's got lots of soil in that cut , er give him a quick injection of the horse serum , that could actually be fatal .
38020:38	That 's why it 's specialized nursing , because the nurses have to do everything for you .
38033:54	So what they normally do is they also give you by continuous intravenous drip They f have to feed you by this tube ,
38242:104	So the fact that the vehicle has been out on shall we a mor a morning delivery and the the back shift man comes in and has a look at it , he would then have to do it all again .
38415:61	Because of his speed and er Th certainly this one here , I mean the Highway Code says that you must make sure that it 's safe before you commence an overtaking manoeuvre .
38440:17	I know but I must n't say that on here .
38452:36	If you think of the trauma on the people who have to deal with that .
38483:53	Having said that , I 've been on some of the deliveries that you guys have to do , and some of the places where you have to go into , and er I fully appreciate it 's not easy .
38483:87	Having said that , I 've been on some of the deliveries that you guys have to do , and some of the places where you have to go into , and er I fully appreciate it 's not easy .
38491:58	And attitude is the thing which erm we look at quite closely , and I think you must consider your attitude .
38501:7	We must have touched a little spot there I think Stan .
38518:15	Oh sorry , I must n't mention the name . .
38631:96	So the lesson to be learnt from that is that erm it 's not always possible to keep yourself out of trouble , but you can do what you have to do to keep yourself safe by maintaining a proper separation distance .
38632:51	And bearing in mind when you get that sort of weather , the separation distance has to be double .
38685:65	And people are quite happy to do that , and there 's te the the the stress and the the tension must build up inside .
38758:4	must be going .
38764:20	Mind you , you 'd have to be quick would n't you ?
39106:9	and you have to be so careful now erm and y you get in the the l the larger roundabouts and more and more lanes .
39247:65	If you keep that in your mind you wo n't get yourself drawn in on a f false premise that you must be okay .
39265:92	Erm and you see people frequently charging across the middle or even to the right-hand side of them because they do n't believe that you know that that they have to you know er be observed and gone round and erm whatever .
39313:7	You must reserve that signal till you get to that point there .
39318:7	You must give other drivers , and riders , time to absorb the information that you 're giving them .
39320:9	So you must give people time .
39412:153	So I said to my blokes on several occasions , and they used to think I was a proper pain in the derriere I expect , Go up sort them out , do n't necessarily report them , advise them if necessary , if they consistently do it you 'll have to use a fixed penalty ticket .
39416:27	Now it 's a fast road , what have got to do ?
39431:38	Well funnily enough I went down there last week , and I must admit I I came round the corner and there was one particular vehicle still does it .
39435:9	And I must admit I th I I sort of applauded him .
39497:23	What it says is you must not cross or straddle the line .
39589:7	you have to fill in the rest of that and give it back to me .
39656:7	There must be .
39862:8	I have to ask , now that you 've said that
39921:26	Yeah , I think they 'd probably have to listen
40028:18	Well I think we have to give them back actually .
40216:19	because then I do n't have to do anything to them .
40228:37	David does n't need any packaging any more so I do n't have to remind myself to
40669:77	It was n't a very full list cos erm er it did n't occur to me until about seven o' clock this evening that I had to go out quite soon and then I just ran around frantically doing things .
40675:59	So I 'm I 'm a bit unprepared , but that 's everything I think that I have to say .
40786:52	The the thing is Yeah , I mean anything Rather than travelling , telephone , because you have to run up an awful lot of telephone calls before it 's worth driving over and doing it
40857:10	We 'll have to take them down the recycling .
40885:23	Well the only one that you have to worry about with me is if it it 's a twenty-five-minute
40907:10	I 'll have to
40964:36	And since he 's the one initiating the meetings all we have to do is get his consent to erm the her his s signature , and the other people 's sort of
41073:10	I 'll have to phone Nick tonight to see if the Captain has a phone number now rather than just an address cos if I can phone him it 'll be a lot easier .
41097:24	But I I that way I only have to hear it once .
41127:12	so I only have to once .
41241:26	It it 's where you do n't have to wear body armour .
41587:9	else I have to do is find a somebody that 'll do cheap photocopying .
41935:8	You have to have an open mind I always think with these things .
41942:12	Again , you must have one that you like the smell of .
41945:7	You must always mix it with an oil .
41947:7	You must always buy what they call a carrier oil to help mix the oils .
42124:10	We always have to have things that you know are easier to do or are not s such a hassle with the environment .
42149:44	It is very difficult to get essential oil from the rose , it has to be done by what they call extraction .
42249:5	Lavender must
42299:9	and they have to keep them up to date .
42327:42	Now then part of it is they ask me You do n't have to , but they ask me to ask people to sign erm to say It 's just to say that you do n't mind your conversation being used .
42415:21	And so I figured that Complete must mean continue on .
42616:74	They 're both the same angle for a start , because we 've got an isosceles triangle , and forty five plus two X must add up to a hundred and eighty .
42750:73	The big thing there is there 's no rule in life that says you know if someone says Five them you must draw five centimetres .
42894:17	S erm so I had to subtract these two .
43228:59	What you could have done say was this one here that 's marked E does n't have to be all of those who supported Everton , it could be just that bit .
43652:12	You do n't have to measure .
43970:22	Erm just remembering say I had to put four O Hs with N H , I was sometimes I was getting it right sometimes I was getting it wrong and stuff like that .
44534:147	Okay right so there 's a s there 's a system to what 's going on with the acids and it 's not just one acid like hydrochloric most of the acids will do it some of them do it very readily some of them you have to get the conditions right often you have to get the temperature high to make it to make the reaction go but a metal plus an acid erm there 's a typical one zinc H two S O four gives zinc sulphate and the hydrogen .
44534:174	Okay right so there 's a s there 's a system to what 's going on with the acids and it 's not just one acid like hydrochloric most of the acids will do it some of them do it very readily some of them you have to get the conditions right often you have to get the temperature high to make it to make the reaction go but a metal plus an acid erm there 's a typical one zinc H two S O four gives zinc sulphate and the hydrogen .
44576:59	if you like so it pinches the two positive charges off the hydrogen cos in these equations the charges must must balance as well so that if you just cross the double positive out you need to you ca n't write it in but you need to remember that it wants to become a double positive given
44576:62	if you like so it pinches the two positive charges off the hydrogen cos in these equations the charges must must balance as well so that if you just cross the double positive out you need to you ca n't write it in but you need to remember that it wants to become a double positive given
44787:40	So you 're doing a bit of detective work here , what must be happening in this ?
44935:9	so it must have been ?
44937:7	It must have been Good it must have been some sort of carbonate , and the salt that was formed was from the hydrochloric acid was calcium chloride , so it must have been ?
44937:24	It must have been Good it must have been some sort of carbonate , and the salt that was formed was from the hydrochloric acid was calcium chloride , so it must have been ?
44937:95	It must have been Good it must have been some sort of carbonate , and the salt that was formed was from the hydrochloric acid was calcium chloride , so it must have been ?
45015:101	You 're learning the same information over and over again , this lot you 're learning the whole lot once it 's it 's as though every time you learned a word , you had to learn your alphabet all over again
45051:89	So if you want to make sorry C O two if you want to make C O two out of something you 're going to at least have to have a C in it somewhere .
45080:77	And each time you work it out , it 's more it it becomes more er one you remember rather than one you have to work out .
45349:126	You could go through again and you could put sodium instead of that M G but where you had things like M G O H twice you 'd just have N A O H so you ' d have a have to do a little bit of changing about .
45371:14	But you do n't have to sign
45401:29	I feel sorry for the poor person who has to translate it .
45544:179	Right Tony 's come here and he 's gonna tape recorder everything that 's says , that is said , your voice , my voice , so we want it all nice and properly done because er they 're all gonna make a special project out of it , reference to spoken word and the written word so you must ask your questions nice and clearly , yeah ?
45563:8	you have to do two years in the police force anyway , you then have to show some kind of application towards it .
45563:46	you have to do two years in the police force anyway , you then have to show some kind of application towards it .
45572:12	But initially you have to show a skill , or some kind of application , to be a dog trainer .
45626:10	I then had to go and have an interview which I passed .
45630:73	Thank you , the in after the interview I went back to Chelmsford where is the headquarters of the Essex Police Force and had to do a course for two weeks .
45632:15	At that time you had to stay with your tutor constable who looked after you for twelve weeks .
45663:176	Right there are two kinds of courts that policemen , well there 's several kinds of court , but the main courts that policemen go to are a magistrate 's court where there is what 's known as , they are magistrates or JPs , Justice of the Peace , and they sit there and you have to give evidence .
45665:49	But the really scary place is what 's known as a crown court where you have to give evidence at crown court .
45745:16	Erm why do you have to be strong to be a policeman ?
45746:12	You do n't have to be strong to be a policeman .
45747:12	You do n't have to that 's er that 's not totally true .
45761:8	You must have common sense , that 's most important .
45847:9	Do you have to be there for a certain amount of time ?
45874:16	I went , I had to tell a lady that her husband had died er about two Christmases ago , two days before Christmas .
45875:29	Her husband died in a car accident and I had to go and tell his wife .
45876:7	It must have been before , after my birthday then .
45889:57	My br erm my step-brother erm lived in a flat and , and the flat got on fire and they had to climb out the window and jump out
45897:121	and it was and you could n't get near it because the heat of the fire was so strong and the smell of the of the smoke was overpow you literally could n't get near it and everyone had to come away .
45921:29	And we 've gotta go around and you have to think of one word to do with police until we stop until we run out of them .
46425:28	Not on them little ones , no , you have to have special adaptors to make those little ones go everywhere .
46433:37	I ca n't arrest you and say guilty cos you have to go to court , so you would always be arrested on suspicion of murder .
46446:20	That 's why police officers have to go to magistrate 's courts , and crown courts , to give evidence .
46461:103	There is an i there is an idea afoot to bring them to this country , to let policemen , cos the policeman 's truncheon is only short use them someone has to be close but these pacifiers can be a offensive weapon and a defensive weapon .
46468:7	You have to go on special courses to carry guns
46538:9	All he has to do is show he 's over a certain age can prove who he is , you can buy a gun .
46622:39	I , when I ass when a policeman assaults someone it has got to be justified .
46634:24	You 're right , yeah , it has to be justified .
46643:21	When I assault someone it has to be justified .
46768:17	Hurry up otherwise we have to turn you round .
47548:18	And I think we must have had this video three times , you should be word perfect by now .
47642:17	We 're going to have to heat it up a little bit .
47656:44	But it is poisonous so if I start smelling it I 'm going have to switch the cupboard on to suck the fumes away .
47699:28	Yeah right it ca n't get out it has to go down the pipe .
47788:9	so we had to put some a bit of heat in .
47898:36	How could it turn the water green what would it have to do in the water ?
47912:43	It would just escape so we sh close the top and the gas has got to .
47960:44	If it can fall down out of that pipe into the jar it must be ?
47962:45	If it erm sucks the water up if you 're not careful it must .
48019:67	You 've got marc underneath which means marcato give a little push at the beginning of the note if you have to .
48053:7	You have to fill in the rhythm .
48055:12	You do n't have to complete bar nine even though bar nine is empty because that 's the subject of question four what happens there .
48056:9	So you have to describe that in words .
48057:7	You have to listen carefully Oh sorry yes fill in the rhythm adding the phrase and dynamic parts for bar five for question five .
48064:15	You are gonna have to say though .
48065:12	You 're gonna have to complete the music for bar fifteen .
48068:15	In bar sixteen you have to name the intervals .
48110:80	Because the more you actually write the music notes Carl the better you will be able to do it when you eventually come to have to write them in exam .
48156:50	Oh yes yes everything 's got to be there all the phrase marks the accidentals have got to be it .
48297:7	You have to put them up because the notes are on or below the middle line .
48299:12	So you 'll have to reverse the tails .
48313:21	Here 's where you now have to start thinking .
48448:11	which I must admit I 'm not an expert on .
48451:87	is that basically erm you you go and work as a dogsbody and erm graduates are allowed to take the exams within two years and and you 'd probably have to go on night school thing or something
48528:17	The think is I have to earn money to do those beforehand .
48554:41	I think the thing about correspondence courses is that erm y you have to be very good at disciplining yourself
48558:25	you 've got your assignment and it has to be done by the end of the week or the end of the fortnight or
48675:7	actually had to have experience of
48706:17	the thing is you have to be slightly careful about those because
48790:18	you know they will have to do that sort of thing as part of a a job and they do n't really want to spend time doing it .
48865:11	and then you have to start paying it back and paying the interest you know .
48926:8	You have to do it over four years I think if you do it that way
48993:52	Yeah yeah well it sounds sounds as though it 's possible you know you may have to I mean in the end you might have to sort of compromise it and actually do this valuation thing .
48993:82	Yeah yeah well it sounds sounds as though it 's possible you know you may have to I mean in the end you might have to sort of compromise it and actually do this valuation thing .
48997:60	I mean I think I 've already resigned myself to the fact that I 'm going to have to do one maybe two years more before I get anything like
49254:104	Now where it goes negative a negative value I do n't think we 'd be interested in that , that means that the car 's got to the point where you have to pay someone to take it away .
49336:29	You do n't know which one you 'd have to check all of them again .
49337:36	So we 've drawn the graph and now we do n't have to keep calcul I mean this is easy it ' probably easier to work it out in your head then to especially with these figures .
49428:40	And you 're your graph paper few metres long , or you 'd have to cramp this scale up quite a bit bring it closer together .
49515:53	What I 've you know when you 're like given a plain axis and I have to decide what to put on the sides I I 'm sometimes a bit
49527:53	the weight equals , the one on the left hand side that equals something that you have to calculate .
49608:80	So there 's a there 's a good point I mean very often you 'll get this point in the origin not always though so you have to watch that .
49739:17	that 's gonna go have to go up to .
50082:51	Erm what have I got here oh I know what I 've got must n't pinch our book must I .
50082:67	Erm what have I got here oh I know what I 've got must n't pinch our book must I .
50155:12	So you 'll have to do that .
50196:19	Some people say , Oh must be fore head .
50301:113	See so it 's just by learning the pattern it 's like say if you were you were playing football every time somebody every time the ball came towards you you had to learn all about the way the ball goes Oh it 's you know it 's slowing down cos the grass is wet and it 's curling and things like that .
50302:11	If you had to learn every time you could n't spot patterns you 'd never you 'd never be able to play football cos you 'd be you 'd always be a learner would n't you .
50407:28	does because those are the ones you have to learn how to spell .
50498:43	Yeah you 'll be getting most of those right and you wo n't have to learn sit up all night saying , Oh he 's given me another thirty five I E words to learn tonight .
50797:20	Do n't know you 'd have to work it out okay .
50822:12	Okay and we have to put something in between there .
50826:36	No one says you ca n't write it down do n't have to do it in all in your head do you .
50887:33	We have like twenty five a test and then these must be another test for another group .
50903:15	you do n't even have to bother learning them .
50930:158	No problem it 's just g it 's a bit funny if there 's more than one of them if you get two or three you do n't say two ox if you had two or three boxes fine but with ox it 's one of these silly words you just have to remember it 's oxen .
51092:12	Well he 'll have to work very he 'll have to do a lot of work
51092:32	Well he 'll have to work very he 'll have to do a lot of work
51111:7	they have to be very good just to get in yeah .
51112:18	So oh well we 'll have to wait and see .
51342:20	One that you 'll just have to learn .
51349:26	This one say said you just have to learn that one cos it 's a bit awkward .
51620:134	So if you learn the words this way thinking well do I know a word that 's a bit like it and could I add a bit onto the end that 's another way another good way of learning cos you do n't have to learn class and classical and classic you just sort of learn one of them .
51719:43	If you were going on holiday before you went you 'd probably have to .
51721:10	You 'd have to put things in your suitcase
51723:10	you 'd have to what would you say I 'll have to I 'll have to something my suitcase ?
51723:39	you 'd have to what would you say I 'll have to I 'll have to something my suitcase ?
51723:53	you 'd have to what would you say I 'll have to I 'll have to something my suitcase ?
51778:51	Because you 'd you could n't hold that much in your head so you have to try and break them down into little patterns of Oh it 's one of that lot or it 's one of this lot .
51796:35	In a way I knew it in a way I had to
52088:16	Oh well maybe I have to practise first without a ball just standing on one leg and waving the other leg about and trying not to fall over .
52456:116	Now there 's no need to learn all of the tables erm er what I will do is if you want any more lessons I 'll do you some special tables cut down so you only have to learn about half the normal and then you 'll know them all cos if you know two sixes .
52561:70	Sixty of them and put them out and make them into nice little lines and that and see what things you 'd have to multiply together to make twelve or what numbers you 'd multiply together cos it 'd be so many sets of like four sets of three or three sets of four .
52587:99	Well I reckon if we practise a lot during the holidays if you play with the pennies and things and think about the spellings and try you know you do n't have to read through the whole dictionary just learn some
52627:100	And for next time I 'll get some erm a special set of tables for him a lot easier to learn so that he can learn his tables and he 'll only have to learn about half of them and then he 'll know all of them .
52879:9	So you had to share yours with someone else and you just got a sixth okay .
52880:75	And then just as you were about to eat that another six people turned up so there were twelve altogether and you 'd have to shar share that
52949:9	So we must be shared now this is the interesting thing which do you think is bigger , a a sixth or a third .
52987:130	So if our mum had cut it up into twelve pieces and then only three people wanted pizza so she cut it up into twelve twelfths and then said who wants pizza and only three people wanted pizza she 'd now have to put some of these twelfths back together again then and just three of us how many twelfths would we get ?
53075:23	They keep saying well a sixth must be bigger cos six is bigger .
53130:72	now this is n't I mean there are some funny rules with fractions are n't there sort of tricky things you have to do .
53168:22	Do this is how we have to add up fractions .
53169:125	If if I say well let 's try and add up a sixth and a twelfth and most people want to add the six and the twelve together and things like that but you ca n't do it that way you 'll have to change them both into something that 's the same .
53344:16	Eight so if you had to explain to her about fractions , how could you tell her about what 's what is it all
53348:93	So it 's all about sharing things out and it gets into this sort of fractions when we get when there 's not enough to go round and we have to start cutting things up cutting the pizza up .
53517:4	must be the adjacent okay .
53721:34	multiply that side by a hundred and twenty so we must do the same on the other side of the equation .
53734:15	Now you 'll then have to look and see if they tell you to give it to the nearest metre or the nearest maybe the nearest maybe the nearest point one of a metre or three significant figures or three decimal places .
53975:35	So we multiply by a hundred on that side so we must multiply by a hundred by a hundred on the other side to keep
54020:33	You ca n't take it that it is you have to draw your scale diagram .
54183:33	and you look at it and you think Ooh must be a right angle .
54330:8	They have to be already there or it does n't er really work .
54831:51	Erm I know it 's easier said than done sometimes but er it has to be your decision because even if you went ahead and were confirmed , we were tal talking about the idea of sometimes parents bring pressure on them on you to go ahead and do it and be confirmed , erm when perhaps you 're not do n't feel ready for it and it takes a lot of courage to stand up and say No I 'm not ready .
54867:101	Erm If it 's if you want some kind of a guideline I think last year I ca n't remember but I think we I think last year we actually had to ask because the parish could n't support it totally .
54924:71	So you might want to remember that when you get in there cos on the first exhibit you 're gonna t have to use that bit of information .
54959:15	Yeah we 're gonna have to dry it first , okay .
54968:28	Toby because they 're late they 'll have to miss the video .
55085:87	And one of the jobs we 're gonna give you to do we 're gonna give you one little piece of a pot and a picture and you have to try and work out which pot that the little pieces came from .
55092:29	Yes good , cos everything that we do has to be very careful recorded and taking the photographs and doing the the drawings and sketches that 's one of the ways of recording .
55108:13	Safety rule regulations have to have a hat on your head .
55159:30	Now sometimes when archaeologists carry out the work they have to get in and out of a site really quickly .
55328:11	And then you have to pull it pull it tight .
55352:29	And this is the first job that we have to do really , is to sort them out into their different categories .
55376:14	So what you have to do then
55410:183	So as a result of that because it 's been erm changed in the nineteenth century the eighteen forties and eighteen fifties , architectural historians who we who were faced with a real problem with York cos York had something like fifty medieval churches and erm er about thirty of them surviving into into the twentieth century , erm and they had to make some decisions about which ones to preserve and which ones to let go .
55430:18	If you er you have to get up close to look at these features carefully , but it shows very clearly that there 's a lot of twelfth century stone incorporated in the building .
55548:31	So what we know is that this must have been blocked up before this doorway was inserted , okay ?
55552:51	Plaster an outside of a wall with no so er with no drip course so this must have been an ?
55553:7	This must have been an internal wall at one point .
55669:7	You must read the question !
55751:104	That 's the only I mean that 's th that 's the real problem with this thing It 's one the the difficulties you end up with You see you must remember to multiply everything that 's there by the number you want to multiply , not just half of it .
55819:7	You must look at this from the minimum of Point of view of the minimum amount of labour .
56053:7	You had to me s make sure that you multiply every term out , have n't you ?
56235:13	Well you would have to although I would have though it might have worked algebraically that 's certainly wrong though .
56268:38	Minus nineteen plus thirty seven without the aid of a calculator must be about eighteen must n't it ?
56268:49	Minus nineteen plus thirty seven without the aid of a calculator must be about eighteen must n't it ?
56276:17	Engage brain Th You must regard a calculator
56280:14	No unless we have to Minus nineteen minus thirty seven divide by two minus twenty eight ?
56480:7	You have to cope
56481:7	You have to You have to be as abstract as that .
56481:16	You have to You have to be as abstract as that .
56758:12	Sir , one has to have in these matters regard to the practicalities of the situation .
56775:61	I should however indicate that to understand properly what is the appropriate position for an inset boundary , I have to look at the reasons for there being an inset at all for the village , as , as you correctly indicate , it lies plainly otherwise within the general extent of the greenbelt .
56779:158	And this is of course , as if I agree with the view that you expressed yesterday in a general context , although it was made specifically then in relation to one village , any recommendation I make in relation to that village , if it is based on the general principle , must apply by analogy also to Skelton , and I would have little choice but to recommend to the councils that they may wish or indeed they should , reconsider this question of washing-over or insetting elsewhere .
56897:56	Policy H Seven applies in the event of Skelton being an inset area when any development would have to be within the settlement , and no more than small-scale , precluding D thirty nine and D forty .
56934:7	It must be a matter of record .
56961:21	Now the questions we have to address here today Mr , er are whether or not er this land , these two parcels of land , serve any greenbelt functions or not .
56966:50	Therefore , unless excluded from the greenbelt by a particular process , all land in this area must be assumed to have a greenbelt purpose .
56971:119	What I attempted to tell you was that there is essentially no region that in respect of any land which lies within the general area of the statutorily approved greenbelt , its mere existence within the greenbelt must be taken to mean that it has a greenbelt function .
56996:51	And all open land therefore Does it follow from what you say that all open land necessarily must serve a greenbelt function ?
57008:66	When you say land is built-up , presumably you do not mean simply that there is a building that there has to be a building on the land .
57018:43	When we look at the characteristics of the land itself , do we have to decide whether it 's countryside or not countryside ?
57019:15	You do not necessarily have to decide that .
57113:7	I must have been misguiding myself for a very long time Mr .
57216:14	And the inspector will have to make that judgement in this case .
57228:22	Before I answer that , I must er address myself to E N V Eleven , which relates to ponds ,
57389:33	It follows therefore , does it not , that one has to look at the characteristics of the land you now propose to take out of the greenbelt , in the same way as the land immediately to the north , which you propose should remain .
57621:18	I think you 'll have to re have to repeat the question .
57621:28	I think you 'll have to re have to repeat the question .
57776:44	But in considering any possibility if development , would you agree Mrs that one must have regard to the suitability of one site versus another site in relation to damage which might be caused ?
57791:10	Er one has to exclude er for example , Strensall , where tremendous development is proposed .
57982:9	And we must remember that we are not talking about any newts , we 're talking about very special newts ,
58008:71	Well er no it 's all right , we we 've got it here now , so let 's see what it has to say about it Mrs .
58013:12	we 're gonna have to go through the exercise you 've been through of identifying the right ponds .
58137:7	There must be no doubt as to that conclusion .
58190:38	If any are received erm by the cutoff date , then it has to be my my submission that we have to have a reasonable time to respond .
58190:64	If any are received erm by the cutoff date , then it has to be my my submission that we have to have a reasonable time to respond .
58199:10	Er we have to have a reasonable time to respond .
58226:29	And this causes me difficulties in that I have to either imagine what it was or come back again to see whatever the er item in question is .
58329:22	that one , that one So you have to be careful what they mean there .
58465:17	Erm radioactivity is You have to sort of get into what 's happening inside the nucleus to understand it .
58479:5	has to hit the uranium nucleus , and breaks it up into two other particles and it releases three neutrons .
59137:31	I mean th it 's Presumably it must be putting out unburned hydrocarbons .
59248:74	this is the this is it 's so easy , you think what 's an alternative to steel , oh it must be a metal , how could I make a bath out of copper or what could it be .
59976:56	And if you have n't made it clear what you meant erm either the court will have to decide or somebody else will decide that it 's different to what you intended .
59992:89	Tax at forty percent , four thousand pounds to the chancellor of the exchequer , he 'll be delighted , your kids will be wishing that they did n't have to pay it .
59999:35	And it 's as simple as that , all you have to concern yourself is does the surviving spouse have enough left to live on ?
60033:18	I presume they would have to pay tax ? .
60034:50	Yes because in practice what the will would say is that the spouse would have to survive for twenty eight days , th the usual phraseology .
60081:90	The er I I shall pull back slightly on that comment in that , if it 's jointly owned property it 's outside the will you therefore do n't have to prove the will to deal with that property , but if it is a large estate and you are dealing with other assets , when you do your inland revenue account you also have to refer to property you may have had the power of dealing while you were alive and that would include jointly owned property .
60081:195	The er I I shall pull back slightly on that comment in that , if it 's jointly owned property it 's outside the will you therefore do n't have to prove the will to deal with that property , but if it is a large estate and you are dealing with other assets , when you do your inland revenue account you also have to refer to property you may have had the power of dealing while you were alive and that would include jointly owned property .
60084:18	But if you do n't have to contact the inland revenue , because you do n't need to prove the will because the estate is too small then you do n't have to tell him about the jointly owned property .
60084:98	But if you do n't have to contact the inland revenue , because you do n't need to prove the will because the estate is too small then you do n't have to tell him about the jointly owned property .
60087:26	Hundred thousand pounds you do not have to submit an inland revenue account , therefore you do n't need to tell them about the three hundred thousand pounds and therefore you wo n't pay inheritance tax .
60088:42	But if your figure was above hundred and twenty five thousand pounds you 'd have to fill int an inland revenue account .
60101:7	You have to swear usually that it 's under a hundred and twenty five thousand pounds .
60102:27	If that is the case you do n't have to complete and inland revenue account .
60103:41	If it 's above a hundred and twenty five thousand pounds you do have to complete that account and you wo n't get the grant from the probate registry until you have done that .
60156:28	Not everyone unfortunately has children so you may have to cast around for other members of the family .
60159:11	You might have to go outside the family , it could be next-door neighbours , or friends from work or social club or wherever .
60210:99	If you leave a complicated estate with lots of bits here there and everywhere and your affairs in mess and the solicitor 's got to sort out he 's going to have to do a lot of work for it .
60224:10	share holdings have to be sold .
60267:12	Erm you have to be in touch with the National Savings and they send the money direct so you do n't actually get your hands on it .
60277:232	Second thing was that having covered absolutely everything she was n't any estate , or at least did n't appear to be any so the surviving spouse was n't very interested in taking out a grant anyway cos it was n't going to get him any funds , so we then have the job of doing what 's called debarring him and basically he renounced his right to be of the administrator and we then had to go under the rules to find the next person which was one of the specific beneficiaries I E the sons .
60278:238	In fact we turned up some gas shares on the way , but er and a bit of cash , but that was n't enough to pay the funeral accounts and she made no provision for paying any of the bills so I sold the gas shares towards paying the funeral account and then got shouted at by the er beneficiary children because I had n't consulted them about selling the gas shares and I said Well , they have to be sold because there 's bills to pay and there is no way of dealing with that .
60279:28	In the end part of there specific bequest had to be used to pay the balance of bills but there was a complaint about how long it had taken to sort out , and it taken long to sort out because it was a home made will that did n't make all the right provisions .
60313:18	Erm so what I have to is an executor appointed provided he lived in the country for instance because his address was abroad at the time .
60314:64	What you would do in your case with children is probably appoint them all and then they do n't all have to prove so they would hopefully discuss this at the time and say Well you know I 'm a long way away why do n't you two get on with .
60348:12	All you really have to do is to know what you have in terms of assets , and to know who you ought to have in mind in terms of your nearest and dearest .
60360:7	They must be independent , not mention in the will you ca n't have a beneficiary who 's a witness , you ca n't have a husband or wife of a beneficiary as a witness either because not I 'm told very first clause there are n't , to get a duplicate made bungalow or something like that he might be missing out on the bungalow and the was The course leader at the time told me the story that saw him and he would n't tell me who it was I want my ten percent commission .
60362:36	Erm so witnesses er ca n't be beneficiaries and they must be there at the same time .
60379:41	more or less with what 's a good will and who you have to have in mind and disposing of the estate and being tax effective so that that .
60383:22	Any alterations to will a will have to be executed in the same way as the will itself .
60531:43	This is the fault of of er behind the fact er we have to ask speakers when they can come to give their talk .
60532:9	And they have to fit it into their diary .
60574:12	You do n't have to do .
60617:22	And you 'll say well there must be a catch in it somewhere they obviously are n't doing it for free .
60768:81	Because you can remain in service until the age of sixty five , if you so choose erm and draw your pension , you do actually have to apply for normal age retirement .
60802:20	Erm again for those people have to be ov over fifty years of age and we operate in the maximum enhancement er provision .
60840:106	Erm anybody who 's who 's interested erm if you 'd like to ask for a leaflet aft at the end of the session because the main thing is that you do have to take advantage of this while you are still employed in reckonable service .
60841:14	Erm so you have to do something now before you actually retire .
60878:106	Erm having made these contributions erm he got a note to the effect from the T P A that erm some of the money that he paid in to the A B C had to be repaid to him as a lump sum because the money coming from that sum would have taken his pension over the forty eightieths .
60931:21	I think you 'd really have to you 'd probably need to look at the booklet and then speak to erm one of the Prudential people about you know the amount of time you were considering paying contributions and the probably just weigh up the benefits of of each scheme .
60998:42	Erm about income tax are they all taxed at source or do we have to do that separately .
61016:9	The answer must be that somebody will pay .
61056:13	You do actually have to make these nominations whilst you 're employed in pensionable service .
61060:12	But you do have to make this nomination whilst you are employed in reckonable service .
61061:28	And again the person that you nominate does have to be financially dependant on you .
61065:39	Am I right , for any of these er nominations , you have to set aside part of the pension you would normally receive so that you actually receive a lower pension because you are making this provision .
61074:32	Also am I right , the person in the provision has to be
61079:22	So it 's a risk you have to calculate .
61121:45	It is n't in addition to the pension you 're getting , you have to be willing to give up part of your own pension in advance .
61127:14	So you do n't have to surrender part of your pension with in mind .
61194:54	on so in and you do n't even need to notify the Paymaster General or you do n't have to notify anybody employment outside the teaching area altogether .
61277:77	And I mean the actual the U K market those in those areas is quite developed and has got quite a reputation but obviously it has got to be able to develop develop and adapt accordingly over time .
61399:63	I mean the furore about actually leasing trains has taken several years to develop erm And you just have to look at at the moment now and he does n't know if he 's sinking or swimming basically .
61432:57	Yes I mean we can understand that if you 're gonna get a cheaper ticket you 'll have to book well ahead and obviously they 've got to to try and ease the the overcrowding on some trains .
61434:87	The sa the same applies for pricing virtually to anything else if if you 're going to take the maximum advantage of flying by air you either have to book it well in advance through a package or whatever or whatever or else you 'd have to go along and sit in a bucket shop hoping that somebody 's gonna
61434:141	The sa the same applies for pricing virtually to anything else if if you 're going to take the maximum advantage of flying by air you either have to book it well in advance through a package or whatever or whatever or else you 'd have to go along and sit in a bucket shop hoping that somebody 's gonna
61450:70	Because the price of a single was almost the same as the price of the return but to get a refund you have to pay an administration charge which when you add it all up comes to me owing them four pounds .
61555:60	Erm we 've made a provision for interest payable on the loan on the assumption that we may have to borrow money on an overdraft basis .
61557:34	For the advertising which is the biggest erm amount we have to spend on is actually forty percent .
61565:64	Erm the large size is really a relatively it it 's a smaller percentage of the market so we 've had to price it as far down as we can that 's why our contribution for the large size is not as large as the Erm the overhead the sorry the capital costs erm will be a total of two hundred and ninety thousand which is two hundred for factory extensions , eighty thousand for plant and ten perc ten thousand for the gasser .
61576:18	Unfortunately we 're gonna have to market ours at about eighty two pence , but we feel this is quite reasonable considering that the vast the biggest sales of this two litre size would be from the milk floats and would delivered to the door .
61615:56	Er we 're we 're aware of the costs and the effort er and that effort may have to er be delayed .
61736:9	Do you have to pay any fee for using the name ?
61804:16	Erm and so the approach has to be quite different .
61807:212	Well initially we we 're we 're going to we 're going to go nationally but very quickly we 're gonna see where erm our strengths and weaknesses are erm and we know already where the erm the large market is and once we 've had a couple of T V spots to make it known nationally erm in the end of course we 're gonna have to erm probably concentrate on those areas which erm er which 'll give us the best return .
61913:77	Erm I 'll turn that over erm right and I 'll say a number and you tell me what number you 'd have to add to it to make it up to ten .
61930:12	but we 'd have to add another if we only had one penny we 'd have to add another nine to get ten P .
61930:52	but we 'd have to add another if we only had one penny we 'd have to add another nine to get ten P .
61961:12	So you only have to learn half of these you do n't have to learn all of them cos you can always switch it round .
61961:41	So you only have to learn half of these you do n't have to learn all of them cos you can always switch it round .
61997:43	Erm that 's that 's really good again you 'd only have to learn up to six add six would n't you .
62207:10	You 'd have to cut it into twelfths .
62443:94	It 's when you you tend to say first thing you say is ca n't do that then you think , Oh well we get the we have to do it just playing silly game we get these funny numbers .
62445:7	You have to say you ca n't do that I 'll make up a new game to play .
62554:10	You 'll have to wait and ask John when he comes .
62564:14	Right so that must be ?
62568:14	right so that must be a third okay and someone holds this up and says , What 's that ?
62591:10	You 's have to get two pieces out of every sixth you 'd have to cut that down the middle .
62591:45	You 's have to get two pieces out of every sixth you 'd have to cut that down the middle .
62756:12	So you might have to try and a try and find out again .
62828:13	And we 'll have to change that to we 'll write it as six over ten then we 'll write it as point six .
62901:53	Now we 'll we 'll we 'll concentrate on some see with maths you have to do things in certain Are we supposed to be doing maths today are we supposed to be doing English ?
63112:36	Once she 's c more or less caught up does n't have to exactly catch up just have some idea of the basic stuff that they 're talking about
63253:7	That must give us a message .
63379:29	Be very careful that y you do n't actually have to use the split that Roger 's using .
63561:32	But if it 's a lousy job and he has to go out to someone like
63936:49	I mean we used to do the annual report because the R C E had to provide something to the General Manager
63946:7	they have to produce an annual report for
64014:33	That if we want an internal report we do n't have to include photographs .
64118:12	We do n't have to colour photocopy them just s
64264:12	We 're gonna have to collaborate on that are n't
64267:17	Cos we 're gonna have to decide on a style and then
64434:93	This , we 're all agreed that it 's a marketing exercise and what we 're trying to do is to get across to our clients , what we have to offer to them .
64714:7	We must tell them something about our staff as well .
64723:12	I 'm gonna have to pop out for a moment .
64835:38	Is it part of the Intercity trademark that the silver swallow has to go to to right-hand up to
64840:7	It has to be a certain size it has be flying
64992:9	than have to constrain himself to one and and and there 's just no m content there .
65041:77	But you 've also got that that that you notice well down the erm the expenditure on a project , that you 're gonna have to have to go back and change something that should have been sorted out at the start .
65041:84	But you 've also got that that that you notice well down the erm the expenditure on a project , that you 're gonna have to have to go back and change something that should have been sorted out at the start .
65170:7	they must fund
65191:33	For us to retain that work we are gonna have to bend over backwards to do what Regional Railways want .
65222:76	for me meeting with Jim was to say , yes , that 's fine but if at the end of the day we have to train down to a certain level within our group , there 's no way can we afford five man-days of lost fees and fifteen hundred pounds .
65242:18	Is that you you must give in our tender documents , we must tell the contractor what he has to allow for in his price .
65242:40	Is that you you must give in our tender documents , we must tell the contractor what he has to allow for in his price .
65242:59	Is that you you must give in our tender documents , we must tell the contractor what he has to allow for in his price .
65253:49	turns round to you half way through the job and says by the way you must do this .
65354:12	so I 'll have to send down
65660:23	It 's not us who 'll have to sit in front
65889:9	So it had to have a structure .
65954:7	gonna have to wait for the erm
65980:95	The only problem is that the first time you do it for each project if it 's a ne if it 's a an old project , then we are going to have to put something in the field which summarizes the total remit for the whole of the group to date .
66004:74	A and I can get er Ken and my clerks to ferret through the old contracts , and all the variations that we 've had to date , and come up with a suggested erm latest remit for the project coordinator to approve .
66025:17	Well you did n't have to , yeah .
66026:14	But we did n't have to , what I mean the point is that we did n't have to tell , have to tell them , they already knew .
66026:58	But we did n't have to , what I mean the point is that we did n't have to tell , have to tell them , they already knew .
66026:70	But we did n't have to , what I mean the point is that we did n't have to tell , have to tell them , they already knew .
66103:48	I see this as a positive element because here for once the client 's gonna have to sit down and produce a specification
66126:22	The future projects we 're gonna have to obtain competitively .
66137:10	We 'll have to compete for .
66194:31	They ran out of money , and they 've had to be supplemented since to get the job finished .
66389:7	He has to get the job done for a price .
66504:7	They have to work for nothing to get the job done .
66507:65	That 's a reality , and I do n't see why this office should not consider the fact that they may have to get involved in that .
66510:4	have to do that .
66570:56	t to get it , is just right because i i in twelve months time we might have to tender for every job .
66590:43	And if that 's what we what it is then we have to do it .
66885:23	the CONDAM regulations actually say the client must ensure that he employs a safety conscious contractor .
66912:8	you have to , you have to be able to bend and flex as , as the organization
66912:20	you have to , you have to be able to bend and flex as , as the organization
67103:7	It has to go to Chris ?
67356:17	Mind you not everybody has to work every weekend do they ?
67404:10	I 'd have to talk about wi I could talk to Roger about it and see what
67598:30	Apart from that scenario where those people will have to apply for their jobs , and the T Os across the board
67606:12	a and not have to posts .
67656:8	You have got to train that person which you could have been doing for years and
67664:12	he does n't have to put Colin in an M S three just because you 've got a vacancy .
67699:12	You 're gonna have to put Ian
67701:12	you 're gonna have to put
67729:85	Now acknowledging what you say Rog , if you consider he ca n't do that work , then as the next phase what we 're gonna have to do , you and I , is to see what action we can take .
67756:34	And he is now our responsibility , and we 're gonna have to er determine what the right management action is .
67767:18	Which means he might have to do some design .
67799:24	I mean we we 're gonna have to , we 're gonna have to be very careful
67799:41	I mean we we 're gonna have to , we 're gonna have to be very careful
67808:37	I I 'm sure that the twos we 're gonna have to close list
67860:9	Well I had to do that agenda when Hugh was n't here , so
67960:13	They they 'll have to take a share
68114:17	Well I think that has to be said .
68407:40	less of that profit , because that twenty eight thousand pounds would have had to have been
68409:12	I , I must be er
68477:54	It 's good news if we do it on a fixed fee and say , we have had to enhance some of our rates
68540:99	Te the important message that you 're , you 've raised and it is a very important one , is that over the next years , I mean we , we will have to change the way that we charge for
68765:57	a problem , and I think it is a genuine problem , probably the biggest problem that we have to address at the moment .
68799:15	You wo n't actually have to pay it out .
68915:47	And my initial target then would be to say , look , what would we have to do to reduce that twenty nine percent to twenty percent ?
68921:7	You have to ask the questions
68995:10	I 've had to turn half of one of my clerks over to fee earning work .
69101:38	which brings up the main point and that is we have got to make sure that those people who are nominated or delegated within the terms of the contract , are people who have the knowledge and experience
69116:34	if that is not the case then I 'm gonna have to change the consultation documents because
69160:65	For instance erm we would give certainly the better M S ones the smaller jobs to project manage , but that has to be very carefully thought about .
69177:123	What concerns me is the project engineers are in close liaison with the client , and have a lot of procedures to go through that er S T Os and M S ones at design engineering level do not have to go through .
69223:13	An and I must admit that I would n't , I would not expect to see anybody delegated within the contract at less than M S one level .
69423:18	this is what you have to do .
69424:7	You have to make a genuine pre-estimate of your
69679:31	For them to sign off price correct , they have got to have had a look at the measure .
69713:15	Well you , you have to do in some cases .
69861:40	Or if it is impossible to do so then we will have to have a look .
70029:12	These guys therefore must have a facility of ensuring that the price is correct , from an internal control point of view I want them to be involved in certifying that the price is correct .
70141:20	I 'm sorry I shall have to fill in the noncompliance or a quick-fix
70158:19	I 'll , I 'll have to check with her another time .
70179:9	But I must say that we 're using these client reports and managers within each section
70196:10	We will have to put in er a summary of the existing remit .
70277:12	we 're gonna have to have a manual involvement or override there by the project coordinator to , to , to
70295:18	Cos now we do n't have to pay interest on our fees , i if , if , if a jam 's spread over six months a a a and it might risk and slip to nine months , we might do better to offer to jam spread it over nine months and only invoice for part of the money .
70333:23	I mean we do n't necessarily have to give him it every month .
70838:41	Freeman withdrew the clause , wrote another one which meant that you had to go back to stage one again .
70935:34	That 's that 's , you , you do n't have to
70994:79	We will just , let 's , let 's threaten him that , that might be a course of action that we 're gonna have to re we will have , we will have
71031:65	He 's got rid of two of his he 's got rid of two of his staff and we 've had to go in and fill that breach .
71073:63	But where I 'm puzzled a little bit by Terry , is about five minutes ago Terry said , people have got to go and beg and
71191:33	Er and I think Roger what you and Terry have to decide is what you want of your parts of the organization .
71490:7	Somebody must be footing the bill .
71700:68	Actually , I 'm afraid I 'm sorry that mike seems to be dead , you 're going to have to come round and stand in front of all these hundred and fifty , three hundred people here doctor .
71706:99	It 's been a very big step to use pressure flow studies at all , and now that we 're used to using pressure flow studies , we 're going to have to go back to the drawing board and perhaps learn to use a different kind of technology that 's ambulatory , that allows us
71725:7	You must be looking at different patients to
71791:12	Y you must have had many more than forty five
71922:93	All the patients who were entered into this study were patients with multiple P T A , P T one , erm N X , M naught tumours , then I must stress that they were problem patients .
71933:70	I will not bore you with going through a lot of slides showing those comparisons , but in a short paper erm you must take my word for it that the two groups were comparable .
71958:9	And I must stress that these were all problem patients and if tumours were present they were recorded as so on that previous slide but they were often present in greatly reduced numbers .
72072:12	But you do have to put figures like that in some kind of perspective .
72086:42	And we never hear about the thousands and thousands of sales that must take place every day where nothing 's gone wrong at all .
72094:15	Now what we have to do , in all those cases , is look at every one .
72131:52	However efficient we think that we are , if we 're honest with ourselves we have to admit we all sometimes make a mistake .
72357:10	Because there must come a point somewhere in time where the shop will say well you 've now had these goods so long they 're no longer our responsibility .
72374:26	And when you think about it they must be illegal , cos if a shop puts up a sign saying no money refunded they are , are trying to take away your statutory rights .
72427:32	They did exchange it in the end but I had to be very insistent and it took three months .
72451:124	And I feel that it , it is a difficult bala in practice it is difficult balance to achieve , to be polite , but to be firm at the same time erm but and there are times when that has to be done .
72456:113	For example if you 've changed your mind and decide you did n't want the goods or if you had damaged the goods and the shop offer you a credit note , I think you really have to accept that with good grace , cos it is really your fault .
72465:29	They , they are going beyond what they have to do by law , and all credit to them for doing that .
72470:103	But , and , but Marks and Spencers are really going , and there are plenty of other firms beside them who do it , but they are going beyond what they strictly have to do by law .
72501:59	Unfortunately you ca n't insist on having a receipt because there 's no law that says shops have got to give receipts .
72513:7	they have got to give you one .
72520:7	They have got to give a receipt
72725:32	And he likes it in a certain place and nobody must touch it .
72935:63	And that 's where you start to get your problems irrespective of whether your appliances are correctly fused you must make sure they are correctly fused but you must not exceed the thirteen amp otherwise you 've had it .
72935:93	And that 's where you start to get your problems irrespective of whether your appliances are correctly fused you must make sure they are correctly fused but you must not exceed the thirteen amp otherwise you 've had it .
72943:7	You must always ensure that you have the correct fuse in .
72947:51	Probably if you 're having a new home built or something like that you may not have to recourse to those because while you 're having , you 're having your home built you can say to the electrician , alright I want X number of power points here .
72978:34	Again , very often in this modern days and age , we have to leave certain electrical appliances switched on all the time do n't we ?
72981:9	So we have to make sure that again the plugs are in good working order .
73122:27	So that 's why , again , you have to be careful with most of our domestic er things that we have er in our homes .
73206:17	The only thing you have to bear in mind is that if you have a smoke detector that conforms to the British Standard kite-mark , British Standard five four five part one , that 'll be quite sufficient .
73237:7	You must also remember , ladies and gentlemen , to change the battery at least once a year .
73362:87	So if I were you I would just have a word with your insurance company and make sure that everything 's okay but you 're obviously , they must know that you 've got to leave your er fridge-freezer switched on , so you 've got to have your mains electrics on .
73416:43	Now , each householder or tenant in a Scottish Homes estate in West Lothian has to pay for this service as well their poll tax .
73432:105	Now , incorporated in these charges there 's a litter collection , so if litter is dumped on District Council ground , but they wo n't it at the Scottish Homes land , then the owner have to pay for this service .
73444:18	Why sho why should we have to pay for this service as well as our poll tax ?
73481:9	Things do have to move on .
73525:41	Ingleston , if we were offered a King 's ransom , we might have to sit down and think about it , but it is very much a long , long shot !
73526:45	But surely the problem is that time 's cracking on and you 're gonna have to start thinking about the Taylor Report recommendations .
73539:12	Well we 'll have to consider that along with land Messrs , cos we think it 's a brilliant site with good road access and we want to work very hard with the people that put the deal together .
73541:55	But wa , but surely an honest broker deal er involving Hibs and the district council di at Ingleston must be an attractive proposition for
73557:96	Now , if Edinburgh District want to talk to us about Ingleston , and we do n't want to upset them , we 'll talk to them , but it would have to be an in , and enormous financial attraction for us even to consider that .
73572:87	Erm I 'm a home help and I go you know , for a lot of pensions and erm the pittance that these er old men and women have to live on a th th , I mean I really think it 's terrible !
73596:150	And some , some of their fa , I mean , if they 're lucky enough to have families who do help them that , er that , that 's fine , but I mean a lot of them do n't have anybody at all , and they really have to pay their gas , electric , rent , poll tax , off an absolute pittance !
73643:14	So , they 've had to get men in , to board the windows up then if somebody else gets the house , they 've got to get these men to come and take the boards down again , then they glazier has to put the window in .
73643:130	So , they 've had to get men in , to board the windows up then if somebody else gets the house , they 've got to get these men to come and take the boards down again , then they glazier has to put the window in .
73720:7	I must say , that I find er calls like the one there from from Nelly particularly shocking and and , and ca n't help wondering how widespread er , this is er across the area ?
73733:17	But something 's gonna have to be done though is n't it , Mr ?
73762:69	Well , I think cu , er cause suffering whatever it happens , but , surely why , I mean the elderly had to suffer through the wars so why should they have to suffer again now ?
73762:99	Well , I think cu , er cause suffering whatever it happens , but , surely why , I mean the elderly had to suffer through the wars so why should they have to suffer again now ?
73770:79	So , I mean , er it 's the proof old folks that get it , they got it in the war time , they had to starve in war time to feed their children .
73784:165	While I sympathize with the caller from West Calder , I feel we pay poll tax as well to cover all these things but when I bought my house , my solicitor had me in for two hours and went through all my obligations under the title deeds part of was , that I had to pay one three hundredths of keeping the open areas clean and tidy plus grass cutting .
73793:105	So yo , so you 're saying that it should have been explained to the man from West Calder that that 's the sort of , er level of charges he 'd had to pay and if he did n't want to pay it he should have taken a different house ?
73800:117	And , I mean I fully sympathize with the gentleman , but I feel his lawyer should explain this to him , and also I feel , why should he pay such a extortionate rate of poll tax and have to pay again for grass cut and street swept ?
73917:160	Er , if those that were earning over a certain amount , who certainly do n't need this child benefit to same the degree anyway , that 's those of at the lower end of the pay scale we could they could certainly save a lot of money , and they would n't have to do the squeeze down on the ones that would have the most .
73925:76	But I mean , er you can see the , you can see the point of that and and presumably , yes , there must be lots of very wealthy people who who er , just get the child benefit and hardly notice it but at the same time , could n't we means test the old age pension ?
73926:11	Cos presumably there must be an awful lot of wealthy old age pensioners about as well who , who could do with a bit less er , from the state because they 've got plenty of their own , er and give a bit more to people who do n't ?
73931:133	Now , I know that these people have worked all their life to get their money and their saving savings and things like that , but if they 're able to manage on wha with less benefit from the government , surely they should n't have to watch other people who struggling and in dire needs because of that ?
73952:79	Now what I would like Mr Alistaire and the rest of the Scottish M P 's is to bring up in parliament a Scotland will have to be revalued every five years as done in the past where England have only been revalued every seventeen years , which I think is most unfair .
73955:54	in a , in as much as er , you know evaluations an arbitrary , and presumably there must be some right of appeal against the decision taken by the district valuer , or whoever carries out the valuation of the house .
73961:18	and any appeals against valuation have to be made soon after the first council tax demands are received at the end of March .
73976:53	Erm because I do n't think these people er appreciate er , what it is to have to count every penny .
73985:188	Er , the economic situation is is entirely their fault , er , not that I 'm saying that the Labour would do any better , but erm I 'd like to see a bit more er , a bit more opposition from the er , from the Labour party and er , not so much direct action , but saying , you know , things do not have to be like this !
73986:12	There do not have to be any homeless people !
73988:59	Erm , but er it 's , it 's quite wrong that pensioners and er , the poorest should have to take cuts again erm when there 's people on such high salaries .
74018:26	The , I mean , how long have to be , have we to , er and I 'm I 'm disgusted with Edinburgh that nobody has phoned in on this sort of point !
74068:63	I mean , I know the government say that , but but think of the money that we er , must be saving now on our armaments bill .
74082:28	So the money , and a lot of money must be getting saved ee somewhere , so I do n't see any reason why that could n't be ploughed back into the , th th the benefit system .
74112:71	You know , and I mean we we work , you know , it 's like er I mean I have to pay full poll tax and all these type of things too , even though my husband 's on a sort of very er basic sort of wage , and I pay all these things you know .
74182:10	Yeah it must , yes .
74190:49	Now , that would have been a W I committee day so we 've had to alter the committee to the Tuesday , so I 'm afraid they 'll be no handy craft on Tuesday the first of December .
74191:18	No handy craft because we have to have the hall for a committee meeting .
74232:13	Because the orders have to be in so that , when Rose goes to headquarters she can fix them up .
74248:10	But you must ask the person , do n't put just somebody 's name down , thinking they might go on the committee , erm , you must ask them first before you put their name on the list .
74248:80	But you must ask the person , do n't put just somebody 's name down , thinking they might go on the committee , erm , you must ask them first before you put their name on the list .
74261:7	You have to be a member for two years .
74273:7	I have to thank Vera for the holiday to Scarborough , not that I went .
74284:60	First of all , I expect most of you have heard that the proposed holiday to Torbay has had to be cancelled cos we did n't have enough support .
74313:108	Er , I should like to the names next month and I hope you 'll all support us because the numbers are going down and if we do n't get sufficient numbers , it 'll have to cancelled like the Torbay one .
74337:9	But you have to do a dance when you want to fill ta time in !
74395:13	You do n't have to worry , there is no , I ca n't think of the word that I want to use .
74400:13	What we must do to have good skin is to cleanse , tone , and moisturize .
74417:10	Then you must cle you must use the toner after that .
74417:21	Then you must cle you must use the toner after that .
74427:12	You do n't have to use make up but certainly to cleanse and moisturize is very important .
74430:43	We th , do then have a toner , but you do n't necessarily have to use the toner because you 've used to water to cleanse off the cleanser .
74623:66	But , with yourselves , do make sure you cleanse properly I 'm not too worried about your toner , but you must use a moisturizer , just to make sure that your skin is nice and soft and supple .
74669:154	Now electrolysis is the permanent removal of hair by the insertion of a very small needle attached to a machine and you press the button on the needle holder which releases current , and that cooks the hair , it actually cooks the root of the hair , but each hair has to be individually treated , so if you 've got quite a lot of coarse hair it can take a lot of time , and a lot of money .
74689:15	You do n't necessarily have to have bright coloured polish on at the end .
74722:37	I 'm telling you all this , and perhaps you do n't have to erm pay for any of these treatments we do gift vouchers , so if you 've got anybody who wants to buy you a gift of any sort , you could always say well , I fancy erm an eyebrow trim , or I fancy a pedicure perhaps they would like to buy you a gift voucher and then you can come in and it could be a present for you .
74723:17	So you would n't necessarily have to pay out for these treatments , you see .
74728:13	You do n't have to actually look at the price list and say oh well I 'll have a back and shoulder massage , which is ten pound , you do n't have to have anything for ten pound , you can have it as little as five pounds , two pound fifty , we do n't mind , it can go towards a treatment .
74748:11	And , I must say ladies , they do smell very nice !
75423:7	I have to write it down .
75974:7	I must have screamed .
76012:7	They had to go back ag go back again for the coffin .
76013:66	The people who undertook er following that route , through such a an entanglement of lochans and turns , would have had to have know their directions very well otherwise
76025:10	Now that must be a good , what would you say , seven miles at least in one direction ?
76049:7	He must he must erm stooped down on his knees and caught it in his mouth and and got it into his pocket some way or another .
76049:15	He must he must erm stooped down on his knees and caught it in his mouth and and got it into his pocket some way or another .
76141:35	Do n't shout too loud because you get somebody 'll have to listen to all this .
76307:24	Well , I thought you 'd have to be
76405:12	I I must yes , shall I
76407:44	I 've said on the note that tea will be available , I must admit I did n't check that , but I will do that .
76466:33	From a hygiene point of view it 's it must be a little ancient by now .
76565:25	the end , we 're going to have to seek alternative
76589:7	Just have to pay , very cheaply .
76628:8	Someone must have made the list . .
76692:26	I have just written down that I must write to him ,
76864:12	Yes , I have to tell you that the Air for Southwell is now in the process of acquiring a beginning and an end .
76871:32	I 've got that broken arm , which I had to put in a sling every time .
76881:12	these things will have to go , but almost
77424:13	So we really must have that back , and I think we must have it in the er traditional tune .
77424:41	So we really must have that back , and I think we must have it in the er traditional tune .
77512:17	Yeah , er I must admit it it 's alright , but .
77533:8	I must admit , if I had if I actually had to say , which of all those would I be most happy not playing , I 'd say In the Bleak Midwinter , but
77533:36	I must admit , if I had if I actually had to say , which of all those would I be most happy not playing , I 'd say In the Bleak Midwinter , but
77755:34	So er we 've got also , we pr we must assume the Choral Society .
77781:8	I have to say , I I wo n't take no bets as to what we actually get .
77904:28	M P , Douglas says , Immediate action must be taken to boost staffing levels at the hospital where killer nurse Beverley Allitt worked .
77916:9	But I had to go in the loft .
77918:9	But I had to pop up there and move back all the bits and bobs and the debris and everything .
78018:18	The question begs , you have to say , How come when you 've just retarmacked a road That 's right , electricity board , gas , erm cable T V company ?
78065:57	Watch out if you live in and around Newark or you 're heading out that way , you must get one of their brochures .
78266:22	M P Douglas says immediate action must be taken to boost staffing levels at the hospital where killer nurse Beverley Allitt worked .
78277:30	The court was told the woman became pregnant and had to have an abortion .
78298:58	The police ca n't even decide to charge someone , t is the Crown Prosecution Service who must decide whether or not they 're going to charge someone .
78299:48	And I think you know , the C P S by investigating the case must always be aware that these people are innocent .
78317:77	It is sad but I mean er alright er people have you know some of the names in Lloyds they 've had to sell everything they 've gone skint .
78440:25	I was attacked too , and I had to get up next morning and tell my daughter , she did n't have a daddy any more .
78441:7	I had to go Christmas .
78442:10	I 've had to go through a funeral .
78486:15	And when you have to walk out across an open room , and everybody 's watching , you start to mice .
78573:32	about a kitchen glove , inside out when you have to blow them up .
78623:9	So you have to news if you want to watch it .
79042:171	I recall being in the first class and er a teacher coming to me , as I were n't paying much attention I think , and to this day I shall remember and never forget , she just folded my arms in front of me and says , Percy , you 're not listening , you 'll have to have a rest .
79043:82	And she put my head on my hands on the desk in front of me and believe me , I went to sleep , it was must have been very , very new , compared to being at home and perhaps being laid there .
79058:28	And er er the week following we 'd all have to spell the word we 'd chose .
79062:62	Most of the textbooks , were handed to us came from cupboards of storage , of which they must have had about sixty each , those classes were always , from then on , sixty boys in a class for one teacher .
79065:107	In st in standard two though , having passed through there , the Headmaster came in near the end of the second year and said because of the number of scholars er some boys would have to miss standard three because there was too many for the class .
79079:88	There were quite a few dunces , and er some did n't always get moved on and they did n't all make it into the top class , they had to stop again for another year , or period , in the class they were .
79102:40	But anyway , most things were like that , I think it had to be something like , In his noisy mansion , skilled to rule .
79103:9	It had to be , he had to do something or they would never have er got In other ways in was a lenient school because as the years went by it was , a register was called , a teacher er opened a book and we called numbers .
79103:25	It had to be , he had to do something or they would never have er got In other ways in was a lenient school because as the years went by it was , a register was called , a teacher er opened a book and we called numbers .
79148:33	er s er but those occupations that worked shift and had to go round the clock had to have eight hour shifts , three shifts .
79148:51	er s er but those occupations that worked shift and had to go round the clock had to have eight hour shifts , three shifts .
79151:115	And the next fortnight I would be on the afternoon shift , which meant getting the same distance , to half past two to work till They were eight hour shifts you see and the night shift likewise had to come a very er a tremendous number from working at the Ford Motor Company at Dagenham ev even in those days , travel from various places .
79194:33	And with the war ending the the Germans had had to pay reparations and that factory and many more were extremely busy because they were making lace machines for France .
79215:7	You have to allow the coins changed now , the three halfpence is not comparable with the present pence .
79219:38	Or it would be approximately ten shillings for a day because we had to work Saturday morning , although it was at Newark and got to travel twenty
79234:42	Was it was it difficult then to to to to have to have got a job in Nottingham , you had to go to Newark because it was w work was n't as ava as as er
79234:70	Was it was it difficult then to to to to have to have got a job in Nottingham , you had to go to Newark because it was w work was n't as ava as as er
79240:39	You could work there being in a trade union but did n't have to say so .
79261:46	And I joined the the engineer 's union , one Saturday night in Newark , had to go back there and they had meetings in the townhall , a room that was hired and er was er particulars taken and I 've been in ever since .
79270:7	We had to stand in a line .
79276:47	And if a yarn was spun , or a general true story that a man had to have his train fare to get to Newark and he had to pay this and that , you could er get a loan on your wages .
79276:83	And if a yarn was spun , or a general true story that a man had to have his train fare to get to Newark and he had to pay this and that , you could er get a loan on your wages .
79277:9	But you had to have qualified for it by working , see ? end of the week and the only place I ever had one was at and because the foreman approached me , I 'd been out of work and got the job by writing to it , going to the library and it was in one of the London papers , they wanted men for the tool rooms .
79296:37	It 's with not knowing how one is that one has to go to the banks and so on .
79367:69	Got back safe an safe and sound tt , was able to tell them all school about too , which really must have been an education for those since nobody had left the town , very far , anyway .
79370:7	It must have cost a lot of money to go for that amount of time ?
79416:32	Well , half fiveish normally , cos because you had to make your own round up , mark the papers and then , say , six o' clock and it lasted possibly three hours , you just in time for you to get to school for probably ten past nine .
79441:8	You had to eat yourself , of course , so there was a s You 'd run up to the hotel in called the Hotel and opposite was a family butcher and he used to sell dripping and bread .
79465:25	It 's a very stiff exam I must admit , when I look back on it , and we all had a a day off to go to the at or the Grammar school , sit this exam er and since I never heard anything I 'm assuming I failed .
79469:41	And I suppose they would n't have liked it if I 'd had to stay till I was sixteen , cos th the money was needed to come in , so I do n't suppose they would have liked it .
79472:26	Well that was n't difficult , you had to be rather brazen , you see , and push your way through because although you knew there was a job going somewhere , you were n't on your own and there 's a lot more after it .
79477:7	you have to do for that then ?
79479:28	What exactly did that mean , did you have to do ?
79497:15	finished from and then had to start looking again for a job .
79517:71	So we 'd fill them and we could n't see anyway , lookin We could n't look down and see , we had to wait for the foreman shouting all the instructions , move left , forward or up or down .
79519:11	And then we had to wait while they poured them in the moulds , but if the moulds failed , and they were rather big , they was full of air-holes and they used to turn it all into a fine just l l pebbles of molten metal , straight back up at you , and you could n't move cos if you moved your crane then somebody would have been killed with out the ladles .
79535:34	So I 'm zooming down , which I thought must have been fifty mile an hour , but it was probably only about five really , or ten , but er put the brake on for the platform to stop , no chance , it just kept going .
79541:7	Just had to leave because Dad says If you 're not working there for eight and sixpence a week , when you had to leave one job at twelve and six .
79541:73	Just had to leave because Dad says If you 're not working there for eight and sixpence a week , when you had to leave one job at twelve and six .
79552:45	Of course , I realize today , the place I hid them in everybody must have known where they were cos I was small and having to reach , and the large ones must have seen they were there anyway , but er it did n't dawn on me then .
79552:106	Of course , I realize today , the place I hid them in everybody must have known where they were cos I was small and having to reach , and the large ones must have seen they were there anyway , but er it did n't dawn on me then .
79566:36	And we started , they gave you a helmet , we had to buy a canteen to put your water in and a metal box to put your sandwiches in and then they took us down .
79600:66	And since it was the end of the belt I could n't get i go by anybody with me , I had to move it .
79640:41	But anyway , reprimanded for that , did n't get sack but er had to move on to other things and that meant to me decided
79680:78	Well then he started at , in a factory there at with er more modern machines , but the factory was too cold , a factory has to be a certain heat to work the lace machines properly .
79769:95	Somebody used to sit on the carpet at one end of the room with a walking stick and a chalk mark in front of him and the contestants used to have to come up to him and try to rub the marking out and he used to rap the hands with his walking stick .
79771:7	It must have been a bit painful .
79841:63	And then after about two years when Father le realized that the lace trade was going he said , must to put to a trade .
79842:45	Because er we do n't know what 's going to happen and she must be able to earn her own living .
79855:27	And er in the apprentice we used to have to go round the shops on the town matching their er material in velvets and ribbons and satin for making their hats of , as well as the straw we made them from material as well .
79858:7	You had to collect ?
79859:56	Collect patterns , take them back and the head used to pick and then we used to have to go and buy what they wanted you see , the amount of material they wanted .
79874:73	We used to have an hour and a quarter fro lunch , half an hour for tea , and we used to er have to get the principal 's tea ready and in the midmorning they always had tea made of milk .
79877:28	And er the bread and butter for their tea had to be cut wafer thin .
79942:81	Er er you see it was all , with me it was when I , at the time I went to work and er I had to leave work to have my baby you see .
80046:77	And it it was , I mean I was brought up in the country and it , I found it really shocking that people had to live like that , you know .
80085:9	So I had to look after myself so I I had one and then I had the other one , just stop at two .
80140:47	Yes , when I got home at night I I was er I had to I was sent to the hospital I was bleeding .
80142:62	And so I would n't use it , I would n't use the so we er my husband just had to take precautions and that was it .
80165:84	Well my husband was out o on strike and I 'd erm got two babies , a year and ten months , and I felt that I had to go and get a job and I was desperate so I 'd heard people talking about these things as they did so I thought well I 've got to do something .
80168:52	And of course not long after that erm I was took ill and er I er had to have the doctor and they sent me to hospital .
80215:200	They would n't , the miners hardly got anything and there used to be soup kitchens for us and er when it first started in nineteen twenty six and er I was pregnant with my second one and I used to walk right down to Pit with a lace , great big lace basket , they would n't let the men fetch the coal and we had to push the coal from there right to the , oh they 've no idea love , no idea .
80216:88	You see there 'd been the nineteen fourteen eighteen War , then there 'd there was the strike , and er I started to work and I had to go to work .
80217:13	And I 've had to work , I worked till I was seventy .
80249:141	And it 's true , I 've seen my husband get water and wash it out well and er put powder and that because , and yet you should n't , you see they were n't safe really but they was that poor love they had to .
80305:19	Slippery Elm you see you had to tape it down to a fine point and then insert it you see , and if you did n't get the right place well it 'd kill you .
80368:25	Was there ever a time when you had to go in for more drastic measures ?
80374:55	I 'm so self reliant that I if I was going o do anything it 'd have to be me that would do it , for the simple reason I could n't trust anybody else , not in that particular thing anyway .
80400:11	Oh you had to pay her , obviously , mm , yeah , did it for money .
80415:20	No I bet the lass must be getting on now .
80470:48	The doctors were very keen you know very keen , and if actually if they had to go anywhere when there was trouble you know say you 'd got haemorrhage or anything like that they were supposed to report it you know .
80532:81	One biggish living room and a little back kitchen with no water and no sanitation and if you wanted to dispose of your water you 'd have to take it out on the roadside and chuck it down the main drain .
80533:16	And you used to have to fetch your water from the pump 's head , just round the corner , outside toilets , we used to have to go about fifty yards to use the toilet .
80533:80	And you used to have to fetch your water from the pump 's head , just round the corner , outside toilets , we used to have to go about fifty yards to use the toilet .
80541:49	And and of course y you did n't have extra blankets in those days , you had to fetch your Dad 's topcoat up and put on if you 're cold .
80555:138	And I can see the o old father when he used to have s want to make the mo the machine immobile , while he did something particular to it , so like you switching the electricity off , well , h he used to have to take the belts off .
80579:12	used to have to w run the old b back the old horse and cart into the co crew yard which had been standing all year with about umpteen beasts on it , trampling it down , more straw , trample it down , more straw , trample it down .
80580:49	Then in back end they used to empty this crew yard and you used to have to handle all that with forks , muck forks , they used to call them , and that was big biggest fork and by God , they used to pull your heart out .
80582:33	And then when that was done you used to have to take it to the field , and put it in we we used to put it in big heaps and then come back , fill it up , and then go out and spread it .
80592:101	Day in and day out , today they can Same with old mowing machines , they used to go out To open a field up in those days , they used to have to go round with a scythe .
80611:50	Cos there 's a way of putting hay on the cart and you used to have to start one lot in the corner , one lot in the other corner , another lot at the back , another lot at the back at the other side and then you 'd fill in your centre .
80614:102	Now if you 'd got grudge against the bloke who was taking it off in the shop , in the farmyard , after when you got back home , of course you had to come I mean they did n't stick it in the field , like they do now .
80615:15	You used to have to bring the stuff to the farmyard to store it , you see ?
80616:86	And if the old boy in the field had got a grudge against the bloke taking it off he used to shove it anywhere so he 'd have to pull it off , instead of following the the seam round , you see ?
80619:64	Sugar beeting in those days , you used to stick the old plough in , plough them up and then we had to go along knocking them , to knock all the soil off , then chop the tops off , put them in heaps , go along with the old horse and cart .
80632:22	An and then we used to have to and there was no no such a thing as bales in those days , duckie .
80638:13	An and they had to be fed .
80639:19	The horse man used to have to go before anybody else , to feed the horses so that , and groom them , currycomb them , water them and do everything , before any of the farmers dare take them out on the fields .
80644:30	Oh aye , of course you do , you had to do , you used to go tater- picking , my duckie , for one and sixpence a day .
80665:10	And you had to put it in the letter box , you dare n't leave it in the in the .
80667:26	And you 'd be surprised what you had to put your milk in in those days .
80679:10	So they had to draw it off , you see ?
80689:59	Six kids , Dad on a few shillings a week , when he was out of work , Mam had to go out scrubbing , washing .
80693:30	And w half a day a w a week and had to be in by nine o' clock .
80696:72	Cooking dinner , and if she got a what's-a-name , if they 'd got parties on , she used to stop there had to stop there till two .
80698:7	we had to look after ourselves .
80699:58	And if me Dad was n't home at work , a out at work , he used to have to do it .
80707:11	And the mothers had to do it in those days , half a crown to do all the washing for this woman .
80730:46	And you 'd put handkerchiefs and collars and that , and you used to have to starch the collars in those days .
80737:53	And we did n't We had n't got a wash-house of our own , we used to have to go to Miss ' s , down the road , to do our washing .
80742:7	You had to go to go to Miss ' s and have it do it there , borrow her copper , and wringer .
80749:10	You still had to ask your Dad for a top off the egg if you were if you were a poor family .
80756:44	Now half a crown in those days was a lot of money , you had to a full day 's work for half a crown , make no mistake on that .
80798:66	A little , enough to cover a silver threepenny bit , in a saucer and some tea on it , and you just had to take it , drink it .
80828:20	By God , it was a must in those days , pearl barley .
80870:46	Now as I say , I started at that price and I used to have to help in the warehouse , in the packing and so forth , and then if there was any parcels to go into Nottingham I used to have to deliver them , by hand .
80870:131	Now as I say , I started at that price and I used to have to help in the warehouse , in the packing and so forth , and then if there was any parcels to go into Nottingham I used to have to deliver them , by hand .
80880:9	H we had to pack hampers , and so forth , see ?
80889:55	Well , they used to do them at fourpence ha ' penny a pair , and each one must be put in a big envelope , so as it could go out on this catalogue business .
80939:31	Well she Me mother , she worked , she had to work .
80940:8	Everybody had to work , and them show people could take a er big machine down and put them up .

81415:16	And we used to have to pick the bind out you see ?
81431:43	Now if anything had been wrong with this shaft we used to have to go to the other shaft and ride that rope you see ?

81736:34	You were n't allowed to have a hearse , you had to carry them to the church , and er er we used to b bury them by lamp light .
81744:7	We had to go home .
81809:18	Which meant that we had to cart this coal from the wharf , take it to the client and put it in his coal house , you see ?
81811:9	But we had to go and take it into his culler I had one day at that , I thought I thought I 'd had enough coal .

81971:20	And er cold chisels , you had to keep those sharp , and er use a hammer and er watch as you did n't hit your fingers and knuckles .
81974:47	Because everything was handmade , er all the holes in the er timbers , they had to be carefully er marked out so that y er when they went to the wood machines there was a er they would be bored in the right place , and the right size of holes .
81975:66	Which was ranged from half inch , to two inches , and then of course the mortices , and tenons , they had to be marked out .
81976:11	And then we had to cut those out , by hands hand , that er of course entailed quite a lot of work er for er for the mortices to be cleaned out , and the tenons to be cut by hand , so that they fit in the proper places .
82027:7	You had to buy your own tools , as well .
82032:18	. Of course , we had to have good quality tools , we had er er now , we had Spear and Jackson saws , always , because they was the best quality .

82050:85	You see , all the iron work , as you took it off , it had to be straightened out , and if it was broken it had to be rewelded .
82051:35	There was no spot welding in those days , it all had to be forge weld welded .
82074:13	And er we had to walk to Long Eaton three times and week , which would be , from here , would be two and a half mile away , and then we 'd we er on the Friday It was Mondays , Wednesdays and and Fridays , and we got paid on the Friday .
82076:7	We had to sign on er three times a week .
82079:19	And then you got You had to go three times a week ?
82111:202	Now er when we 'd done a waggon er it was n't just er right , that 's alright , er we had a railway examiner come along and er he 'd go round it and if there was anything as he was was n't satisfied with , or any other further repairs , he he 'd stop that waggon from going out , and er of course we had to go r go back and do it .
82113:46	Well then every three years all the wagg at the end , er they had to have an M O T .
82135:65	I was still there , I was in er it was classed as a reserved occupation , so I did n't have to go to to the war .
82150:10	Er we had to go to er do manoeuvres er every Sunday , see ?
82159:9	So I had to stay back in er in Stapleford , the Stapleford Home Guard .
82161:15	So you never really had to use any of
82167:37	Erm working at the same place for so many years you must have had ?
82195:34	Now er when er I was er eighteen I had to do pay er National Health and er it was abo er about a shilling a week and
82206:90	An but the National Health for his er , he got medical treatment for himself , but there 's nothing for his family , or his children , they had to pay the Doctor .
82276:35	But , at fourteen , my job was to er I had to fetch the coal and the sticks , to light the er stove that held the irons , and er they they were er d I I Like I had to go to the coalhouse which was down fourteen steps , the steps were wooden ones , outside the upper floor , where we worked .
82276:129	But , at fourteen , my job was to er I had to fetch the coal and the sticks , to light the er stove that held the irons , and er they they were er d I I Like I had to go to the coalhouse which was down fourteen steps , the steps were wooden ones , outside the upper floor , where we worked .
82277:12	And so I had to drag the coal scuttle up there , I was faced with that , and chop the sticks , which I 'd never done before .
82280:23	And er the all day that stove had to be kept , in summer and winter , because there was no other means of heating the irons .
82286:39	I was n't a bound apprentice , as such , I did n't have to er it meant that I did n't have to stay with them .
82286:68	I was n't a bound apprentice , as such , I did n't have to er it meant that I did n't have to stay with them .
82291:92	Well , we should have knocked off work at about twelve on the Saturday , and instead of that , being a shop , they were taking orders and we had to do all the alterations as they came in , and bought the clothes .
82294:42	Next week came , and we never got that half hour , so it must have added up a lot , all throughout the year .
82300:73	And er also down at Long Eaton Labour Exchange , which we walked to , or went on the train for tuppence , we had to er fetch our money on Friday night .
82310:91	Each man then , there was about , there 'd be about four or five men there , all had a number of girls working for them , and er they had to pay the wages out of what they earned .
82315:11	But the men had to balance it up by , what they called chits , tha that came on every garment and how much er money they were getting for it .
82316:19	And then , of course , had to take their own wages out , as well .
82330:45	So as the shop , you see , did n't pay the wages , they had to just pay it on the things that were done .
82332:157	And I went in there , and asked for their tailoring department and er er I found out after that I was just dead lucky , one of their trouser finishers was going to er leave , she was getting married , and she was leaving and erm although you did n't have to leave then , she she she sort of had got to leave , so er I just fell lucky , there .
82333:104	And this Mr was so taken aback , by me going in and asking for a job , and they 'd always advertised in the paper before , that he said , Well , she must want work if she 's gone after it .
82353:42	Whereas er in erm a factory , I believe , they would have had to have er the rooms whitewashed , colourwashed or whitewashed at certain times , we were n't bound up with any regulations , then .
82384:35	And er I got a questionable spot on the lung and had to go to the Ransom Sanatorium .
82389:28	And we , Every morning , when we had to strip-wash in the bath er in the bowl-room , the frost was on the ground .
82392:184	Well I stayed on as an orderly because they said that I could erm I could marry because er I was n't erm classed as erm tt Er I would n't pass it on to me husband , so I could marry , provided I I prevented having children for er five years , that you had to see the Doctor until The medical Doctor at Nottingham , until he pronounced you clear , you see ?
82469:33	The General Strike , it 's a strange memory because I had to walk down Pad er now , erm I forget what the proper word is now , er it 's called Walk , now .
82471:44	And er Granddad was on maintenance , of course , and I used to have to take his meals , so I used to go past the er picket , along with many other people who were busy coal out of the pit tip .
82492:86	It was hardship in this , that er , perhaps the hardest time came after it when er , well it was called public assistance then , social security payments had to be payed back .
82515:9	Compensation had to be fought for , it was n't a matter of right , and a piece of a very small piece of coal fell down the shaft , the onsetter 's the man at the bottom , and it through his hand and he got compensation and then my father was sacked for the shovel .
82519:54	And er after that , my father went with the rounds with the collieries , where you had to belong to union to go to them , and Colliery did n't accept what was called the old union .
82613:7	He must be rolling round , cos he was the maths master , he must be rolling round in his grave , as people say percentage , because he if you said percentage he yelled at you , Percentage of what ?
82613:48	He must be rolling round , cos he was the maths master , he must be rolling round in his grave , as people say percentage , because he if you said percentage he yelled at you , Percentage of what ?
82627:87	Wrote hundreds of letter , er to the people you wanted to do , because I 'd never expected having to find a job , I must admit , because the year before I took School Certificate I had got a Naval a artificer apprenticeship , but then I got kicked in the eye playing rugby , and failed a medical .
82628:33	Something I 'd never to do , so I had to settle down and get School Certificate , which I got with my matric exemption , and people from did .
82650:96	Erm used to go down to weddings , at the register office on a Saturday morning , and hope that they 'd turn up without witnesses , because then you had to be compensated , , for giving your service .
82655:28	In going to measure houses , did you have to actually go out and visit houses ?
82656:31	Yes , oh aye I Yes , we You had to measure , and in those days , the councils were grouped in what they called Assessment Committee Areas , and each were wor making sure the other areas were using the same sort of basis .
82721:18	That 's when I had to put these things onto dea er put death certificates into th their the doctor 's certificate into English , erm they were pretty good , t others were n't so g , er you know , were n't so good .
82725:12	So yo you had to fill in births and deaths certificates ?
82726:17	Oh yes , I had to co copy them , and er you know , you got these things , but the registrar he was , you know , he was man .
82861:18	And my mother used to have to go out to supplement our income you see .
82890:89	Well I , this this is something that 's always staggered me because he worked seven days a week , down the mine feeding horses you see , had to be fed , and watered seven days a week .
82948:26	And as I say you used to have to erm children used to hav well the elder children had to give a turn with the mangling .
82948:61	And as I say you used to have to erm children used to hav well the elder children had to give a turn with the mangling .
82949:32	Your mother fed the clothes into the rollers and you had to turn the old mangle .
83006:7	We had to share a room .
83043:14	We used to have to pass on the way to school we used to pa pass a bakehouse , Bakehouse , in Road .
83079:8	They had to be , they had to be .
83079:23	They had to be , they had to be .
83080:7	They had to make things .
83109:33	As I say the first one that was found had to , it was his turn to be on next .
83112:163	And you used to er stand this on a house brick , like it might be on there , and you had another long stick and you use to hit it on one end and as it flew in the air you see it used to fly up then you used to have to hit it as far as you
83115:51	Again you used to drop it and whoever was what we called on had to fetch this peg back again , put it onto there , and then come and find us again .
83146:82	Three times a day , well twice a day as we were young , as we get older it was three times , it means we have to go to evening chapel as well .
83157:228	That was your annual affair and the er the er the chapel itself was at the end of it used to put up a tiered platform if you can imagine it you know at the end of the little chapel and the erm the younger children was on the bottom and as you got older you graduated to the top and er I do n't know why it was though but er I always had to say the collection piece .
83161:232	And we the used to pick on a on some sort of a nice looking little boy or little girl to say the collection piece that was appealing and I ca n't remember what it was now but er probably about four verses of what they called a collection piece , just before they started to collect you see and erm I think I said that three or four years erm running almost , so I must been pretty well good at it .
83184:23	But erm er we used to have to go Sunday morning .
83309:7	He had to go you see , but I mean er later in my lifetime when we lived in the in the village at I can remember very very well the the er the miners there er going to work and then coming home again , going to work and coming home again , nothing for them to do .
83319:121	I mean I can remember the nineteen twenty , I I were n't sure whether it was the twenty one or the twenty six strike , and my father was erm on strike , you see , but the ponies had to be thus cared for in the field an I do n't think he received any pay and I remember very well erm going to the , my father applying for relief , and er we had to go and face the erm Court of Referees .
83319:231	I mean I can remember the nineteen twenty , I I were n't sure whether it was the twenty one or the twenty six strike , and my father was erm on strike , you see , but the ponies had to be thus cared for in the field an I do n't think he received any pay and I remember very well erm going to the , my father applying for relief , and er we had to go and face the erm Court of Referees .
83320:32	And I can remember as a child my mother had to go , my sister , myself , and my father .
83330:84	And erm anyway they went into all your means , and what you 'd got and what you had n't got , I think my father had to sell his cycle .
83332:25	And erm the provivo proviso was that you had to pay it back though .
83333:40	And as I I recall on a Saturday morning I used to have to take the er one and sixpence each Saturday back to this House , and they used to issue us a little receipt and I remember my father keeping all those receipts until it was paid off .
83372:99	You 'd have a patch you see and your trousers would be patched , and er I had no brothers to sort of hand-me-downs so of course mine we went had to be worn out , and erm you 're normal attire in those days was a er a pair of trousers and a jersey , you did n't have a suit as such .
83373:30	Er when you did get a suit it had to be kept for Sunday , for going to to chapel you see , and if you were going to have a new suit it would always be at anniversary time , you did n't get one every anniversary .
83398:14	You used to have to go right down the garden .
83407:88	You used to have a little book and er the grocer would write it down what you 'd had in the book you see and then you had to pay for it on th at the weekend .
83410:47	And erm that 's how it used to be so o obviously you had to pay like that but er I can remember the the Coop coming to .
83434:41	When you think of the work that the old grocer used to have to do you know , make you a three corner bag out of a bit of paper , to put a pennyworth of pepper in .
83441:58	That 's been sort of revolutionized , when you when you think that you used to have to buy , did n't have to buy your tea , but you used to buy a tea from the chemist shop and the only person that sold it was a chemist , that was .
83441:75	That 's been sort of revolutionized , when you when you think that you used to have to buy , did n't have to buy your tea , but you used to buy a tea from the chemist shop and the only person that sold it was a chemist , that was .
83474:12	What everybody had to put their
83549:32	Er a pair of shoes if you bought it had to last you a long long time .
83578:16	But er if you had to paper the parlour was always papered in the ceiling but he kitchen was always whitewashed because we had these , if I explain to you these er fireplaces that er were n't very successful burning coal you know and the smoke would rise and before you knew where you were the ceiling was black again so sort of every so often up went the whitewash brush and you 'd whitewash the the ceiling .
83588:79	It was an amazing thing really when I when I look back and think about the decoration side of it because , those fireplaces were had to be seen to be believed because they were , if the wind was in the wrong , you we , the room was full of smoke .
83589:87	And the kitchen was just through there and er my mother when she used to bake and cook er the blue smoke would be everywhere and er it must have been terrible when you think about it you know , terrible , it must 've been .
83589:137	And the kitchen was just through there and er my mother when she used to bake and cook er the blue smoke would be everywhere and er it must have been terrible when you think about it you know , terrible , it must 've been .
83603:35	And there was a very long corridor with a mo what must have been I should think five , there was no sixth form , so there 'd be five classes , five classrooms off this long the hallway perhaps as wide as this room which is what thirteen feet .
83617:61	And erm I think I was in the middle somewhere , I was n't er brilliant but I must have been somewhere in the middle I suppose .
83623:31	I mean er I remember one year we had to we was asked to write an essay or a composition as it was called then , not essay , composition .
83660:79	Now being late , the headmaster always dealt with you fro being late , that was n't a teacher 's responsibility at all.You used to have to line up all those boys that were late , you used to have to line up outside the the headmaster 's room , one at a time , I I jus on each hand , you used to have a cane on each hand .
83660:124	Now being late , the headmaster always dealt with you fro being late , that was n't a teacher 's responsibility at all.You used to have to line up all those boys that were late , you used to have to line up outside the the headmaster 's room , one at a time , I I jus on each hand , you used to have a cane on each hand .
83675:33	It was a very very rare occasion , er you had to be ill to be off school .
83696:43	In fact my own wife , she came of a big family and and she had to look after most of the the younger children until they started work you see and then it was the next one that had to look after them again you see and so on , and that 's how it went on .
83696:121	In fact my own wife , she came of a big family and and she had to look after most of the the younger children until they started work you see and then it was the next one that had to look after them again you see and so on , and that 's how it went on .
83705:14	You used to have to take a er a erm your own cup and erm that was for your for for whatever we had we I do n't know I remember we had lemonade or pop or whether it was tea or we had er we had to take a cup , and er most of us invariably took a a big handkerchief with us .
83705:150	You used to have to take a er a erm your own cup and erm that was for your for for whatever we had we I do n't know I remember we had lemonade or pop or whether it was tea or we had er we had to take a cup , and er most of us invariably took a a big handkerchief with us .
83720:16	And er we 'd have to clear all those away , and the chairs would be put into rows as I say , the boys 'd sit down one side , the girls would sit down the other .
83740:26	And it you broke a window you had to pay for it .
83743:7	You had to accept the responsibility if you broke the window and your parents used to settle up for you .
83792:10	So we had to get out anyway , and
83885:8	the council have got to try and cater for every one .
83960:9	So I have to go up and visit them , but her parents never come down here , only once in a blue moon when they feel like it .
83963:9	So you have to keep spending your money to go and visit them .
84024:11	And then you have to keep , see in one bedroom we 've got a , you 've got a ventilator
84045:12	Have you ever had to , have you ever had to actually , have you had any major things that have gone wrong in the house or had it been okay ?
84045:32	Have you ever had to , have you ever had to actually , have you had any major things that have gone wrong in the house or had it been okay ?
84104:12	So we 've had to get things out of her sister 's catalogue if we want them .
84133:109	And we we go in car shopping and we always get our s shopping from , you know with it being cheap , and we go in her brother 's car , and so we do n't have to carry it back all the way from , but round here you see you 'd have to go out , you 'd have to take the kid with you , and your girlfriend , and then you 've got to come back with all the shopping and your kids as well .
84133:161	And we we go in car shopping and we always get our s shopping from , you know with it being cheap , and we go in her brother 's car , and so we do n't have to carry it back all the way from , but round here you see you 'd have to go out , you 'd have to take the kid with you , and your girlfriend , and then you 've got to come back with all the shopping and your kids as well .
84133:184	And we we go in car shopping and we always get our s shopping from , you know with it being cheap , and we go in her brother 's car , and so we do n't have to carry it back all the way from , but round here you see you 'd have to go out , you 'd have to take the kid with you , and your girlfriend , and then you 've got to come back with all the shopping and your kids as well .
84157:9	So I have to I I sit there the week before I get the you know before I get the money , I sit there and work it all out .
84160:9	And I have to sort it out , sit there , sort it out and then work out how much it 's gonna come to , and then I know then when I go to the shop I know what to get , and I know when it goes in the cupboard I know that I 'll have a meal for every day of the week .
84175:9	And you have to pay a penny for each bottle , summat like that .
84230:12	See he has to send his his missus out shoplifting and things , just to get money so he can buy drugs .
84568:38	Moving on , erm in te you know obviously you must have had a fair amount of c you said you had a fair amount of contact with erm tenants in the flats .
84707:7	And must have been I think it was one of the things that that helped to lead to a more settled period .
84718:51	If you look at erm the the turnover of shops down that road , then that must say something about the amount of money in the area .
84824:45	No one no one could say that they could endure noise , and it must be awful to live next door to it .
84990:12	Er and one had to have sympathy w with the police who who 's response was , Well you t you tell us what 's the right thing to do .
85099:10	And we had to help them to move and you know help them to move their things and really I saw the kind of difficulties the girls would be living under .
85124:84	And erm also but I I was glad to experience the kind of things that people who were living in the flats without choice , had to experience .
85138:16	and partly because I had to have an operation which meant that it would n't be easy for me to live in the flats any longer .
85179:10	Occasionally we had to go away to one of our other convents for meetings .
85206:51	Erm also do you know like , people would say things like , Oh you must be very brave living in the flats .
85405:12	When you had to keep pestering them to do it .
85436:50	And I think it w w was quite difficult for people because they 'd either have to walk a long way to try and make a telephone call .
85499:11	If you had to the real
85574:37	Erm t th certainly it makes me really angry that people have to struggle for the basics and I you know I I just do n't see how people who are on long term benefits , erm state benefits , can survive without getting into serious debt .
85674:24	That this was the way people had to live .
85714:114	Yeah well I I had erm access to quite a lot of you know , quite good clothing , er both children 's and adult 's and erm while I did n't feel that it was that people should have to depend on someone else to give them clothing , erm in some ways it went against the grain to do it .
85737:105	And I think erm as for you know , what we as a sho society should be doing , erm you know that 's the whole economic policy , erm would really have to be looked at .
85830:135	If someone comes and they 've actually run out of food , and they 've you know , for some reason or other their giro is either held up or you know , they 've had a big expense er which they 've had to pay , then we would provide them with something .
85857:233	Well it I mean already , it is having quite an im impact erm especially for items like furniture and bedding , and I mean bedding does n't last for ever , especially with a family , and I know erm they 're allowed every so often , but erm I mean I think erm the the cutbacks are becoming more and more and more and and people seem to be which means that we have to look around for voluntary erm agencies that ca such as , who can provide us with furniture or beds and bedding .
85905:33	And er that they they still , even when I have to do things , which are not very erm happy either for me or for them , erm I 'll just give the example of removing a child from
85915:14	that we would have to do that .
85923:87	While we actually do the a the removal , we usually have other agencies with us such as the N S P C C , the police , who have to carry out the investigation into what has actually happened , and erm in the end the court .
85924:40	Because if the court does n't say that , Yeah , this child must remain in care , erm you know .
85971:29	Erm well I think , what they have to do first , is
85978:21	And I I think I must say that i it 's well certainly in Nottingham , my experience is that the church of England is and perhaps other churches , are more aware of this than the catholic church is .
86265:9	Then you have to you 've got what your your answer Let let 's say , we keep our swallows in cages .
86500:34	So how long , how many hours would three men have to work , before they 'd made up forty eight man hours ?
86532:18	X times two hours has got to be equal to
86607:22	And how many hours would six men have to work for before they worked thirty six man hours ?
86630:72	The men times the hours when whenever you whenever you get your answer , you can check that your men times the hours must still still be the same as it was when you when they gave you the question .
86911:53	And then they ask you to find the function , and do something with it , you have to use that function there , you have to use that in it .
86911:77	And then they ask you to find the function , and do something with it , you have to use that function there , you have to use that in it .
86919:46	Er as a end result that number , that 's a function but you have to do something with it .
87067:34	So that x , whatever you use it with , has to be X squared plus four .
87247:53	So think of a function , keep it nice and simple , cos you 're gonna have to work it out .
87282:13	So that F has got to wait outside , the brackets , till the stuff inside 's been worked out .
87395:23	Well is it I 'd have to work it out would n't I ?
87480:40	Well I I thought , that functions came into it , I must say .
87628:15	a fraction so you must have some idea of fractions .
87781:9	So we have to take away , twenty seven metres .
87798:67	Given that X is less than three centimetres from here mm mm mm mm , indicate the region in which X must lie .
87834:49	Indicate clearly , by shading it the diagram , the region in which K must lie , down here .
87938:15	And then all you have to do , is measure off something , a diagonal or
88464:14	you you 'll have to make the time somewhere ,
88645:7	I must do that bit and that before that .
88646:35	And make sure this bit is earthed , but that must n't be earthed and
88755:24	So it means that you do n't have to be a brilliant singer .
88944:12	we do n't have to have a precedent even do we if it if it
88950:17	Yes oh yes , parents have to be asked as well .
88987:27	Well I think the consideration and the research has got to go on for some time .
88992:24	I think as well the young people have got to be motivated , to come to what they find here .
89069:41	And er when you get up to speak at the conference , you have to give your name and the reason why you 're there .
89127:55	You ca n't be actually following the whole of the action all the time , cos you have to make sure you 're not burning a hole in the shirt .
89153:9	And we must n't let words and other fashionable elements , become too dominant .
89161:9	It all had to be his and hers , or ours or whatever .
89245:29	That we can use them , but we must not always assume that everybody understand what they mean .
89329:39	If you want to know what the messages are , you have to listen on Tuesday , Wednesday and Thursday next week by the way .
89335:8	You have to do either your own or somebody else 's er bit of the story .
89359:44	No no it 's not , he explained to me exactly what I had to do , before he went .
89380:13	Then worship , has got to encompass all age groups .
89391:22	Be a radical depar we 'd have to learn an awful lot about what it really meant .
89434:105	Er the main stumbling bock block that people point to for this , is the I think it 's in Paul 's writings , when he says that the communion must not be taken unworthily or without you know due thought and and sincerity .
89437:39	But you know , there is an instruction there , that we must , we must be careful , and prepared to examine ourselves in in all sincerity and truth , before we come to communion .
89437:49	But you know , there is an instruction there , that we must , we must be careful , and prepared to examine ourselves in in all sincerity and truth , before we come to communion .
89478:13	You 'd certainly have to rewrite the communion service , for young people to understand it .
89577:23	I do n't know my grandmother must have took to me .
89578:231	And er and then er of course I went back to me mother after me grandmother died , I went to me mother and er mind you when I was th young there was a lot of poverty about you know there was er no security pay and no er and you could n't get any money from anywhere or anything like that you know and er so it used to er had to do the best you can .
89589:14	You used to have to cook everything on your fire .
89590:7	You had to cook everything ?
89599:9	So you had to scoop it out into
89645:14	You used to have to scrub them .
89647:14	You used to have to scrub them .
89651:16	You used to have to rub all your clothes and on this rub board or get a little brush and and scrub the s collar and your cuffs and then in the salt water and get all them in and then you used to have to ponch them with a ponch or a dolly peg , what used to go round like that you see .
89651:132	You used to have to rub all your clothes and on this rub board or get a little brush and and scrub the s collar and your cuffs and then in the salt water and get all them in and then you used to have to ponch them with a ponch or a dolly peg , what used to go round like that you see .
89657:51	And er lace what 's got all the scallops round , well you used to have to do that .
89677:11	Used to have to be very rather experienced in them days to do this here net mending .
89696:16	And they used to have to put it like that on these er pins all the way down .
89704:42	Then thes they used a pole this er and you used to have to behind stripping all these off lace off the pins while these here ladies was folding this er net up .
89720:26	Well in them days you used to have to er work for eight till six or anything like that you see same as when I was wo first went to work .
89894:69	Er like such as er like er at er night time before we went , we always used to I had to go to bed early .
89895:48	And when we went to bed early we used to we One used to have to fill the kettle , and then the other one used to have to set the table for next morning for next morning .
89895:87	And when we went to bed early we used to we One used to have to fill the kettle , and then the other one used to have to set the table for next morning for next morning .
89921:39	No me mother she she did work hard well we all had to do in them days .
89922:64	And of course and then when we got older , when we got in us teens , we used to have to help us mother with the cleaning .
89924:10	One 'd have to do the bedrooms , to clean the bedrooms .
89925:22	And ano and the other one 'd have to do the stairs .
89926:27	But that one as done the stairs had have to do the bedrooms the other week .
89942:54	And then on a Sunday morning , we used to erm get up and we used to have to do the cleaning between us .
90038:22	And of course we used to have to go on tram cars to the school and Road .
90042:44	And then she used to take all those together and she used to have to give the conductor so many tickets each time she went .
90172:16	That was , that must have been a lot of money .
90253:13	What did you have to do for this job ?
90257:78	Well as I told you at you used to clip them that damn short and we when I was knocking them off , I had to keep dodging down , let the wag and keep knock clips off and chuck the one side and then the wagons came down They went down the hill like that , and then up here there was a hook line to stop them .
90271:27	Well with the others , it used to have to brake , if it were going too fast , you had to brake up a bit .
90271:63	Well with the others , it used to have to brake , if it were going too fast , you had to brake up a bit .
90288:13	A a we had to walk down , but he used to when he was younger he used to break break the ice up formed in , before they could run down .
90294:27	What what did you what did you have to do ?
90296:23	Being a four lad what did you have to do ?
90342:16	Of course you you had to tell them eighteen .
90344:26	We we got this cheap and we had to catch a tai train next day at nine o' clock , going to Newcastle .
90358:7	You had to run when we got there we had n't got any equipment you know , so we used to get out at night , if you had n't got your ga bandolier on you got pulled up , the red caps pulled you up , wanted to know what was the matter with you .
90379:9	And we had to go in N R E fe fatigues .
90383:7	We had to keep that clean suppo And they were n you you was working about six days out of seven , I got one or two days extra for not having clean harness I could you had n't got time to do it .
90390:29	As it hap as it happened they had to do two .
90393:45	So I got up , but I was that s weak I had to sit down again and er the n the nurse that come in she said , You stop there till doctor comes .
90417:63	Well I had another I was in the er I got some much leave you know , then we had to come back to er at back of the er where it er .
90475:7	I had to walk three mile to work , Doubled up when you got so far down .
90484:7	You had to bend down when you 's walking down .
90494:33	Well I worked there and then er quite a bit I had to w they had me working on the main road .
90497:7	I had to run them coals out and I tell you the they come over the top of and of course ' s coming up here , ' s coming down here and did meet there .
90508:7	I had to see as the wagons in the coals as it shifting , not falling off you see .
90514:31	It 's just that that just how I I had to be .
90666:59	And and things settled nice and quietly and all the blue lights come flying down here , and so we had to they was about to chop down this blokes door and we said , Whoa whoa whoa .
90711:110	But if we there again if we see somebody that 's being mugged , and we think that we can assist , or we can deal with it , then we will , you have to take every situation as it comes .
90872:9	So you have to you 're just doubling back on yourselves .
90907:23	The lady lives over the blues must have a set of earphones somewhere .
90923:80	You you walk round the flats , and you know , you walk round them for fourteen months , and all of a sudden you have to stop and think where you are .
90977:10	So we had to get the bobbies down to kick the door in , and you can imagine at three o' clock in the morning , some some deaf and dumb couple , there 's this big coloured bobby le leaning over and waking them up .
91203:18	and every now and again he had to take off er he had to come off poorly .
91203:38	and every now and again he had to take off er he had to come off poorly .
91238:42	Or not I mean , do you feel do you think you have to lock a door , or
91378:7	I had to go and get it up across the road .
91403:16	Of course I 've had to get .
91618:9	My son had to stop off of work to see to the t two children .
91624:7	He had to stop off of work .
91723:22	All well we all said it must have been a quick job .
91780:12	Course you had to run out in snow , run out in rain .
91928:33	But you ignored them but in the end we we had to something abo about it .
92076:89	Well it 'd probably be the June or July before I went in for this exam , which they did n't hold very frequently and er then I had to to pass this exam and that I could leave school in the August , Bank Holiday .
92120:13	Well now everybody had to be in a union in our factory , it was er it it it was they were closed shops all of them .
92186:152	But while we were there they had several meetings because of course we were going to be demobbed anyway , and the Colonel er of the regiment he had us together and so did the officers , and warned us that when we got back to civilian life we must er beware of these agitators who tried to er create suspicion amongst the troops who were coming back , and telling them that they ought to join er these revolutionary parties .
92187:53	Warning us all about this , so well I thought well if they warn us , something must be good here , if they 're warning us that it 's bad you know .
92202:35	Now you 've heard about them of course , you must have heard about them .
92216:130	And he er and he was really delighted of course , so he said , Well I 'm holiday and I 'll come round with the caravan , so I had my holiday which did n't make much difference because there was had to you know we were n't working really , and I went round with him for this week , all round and the villages everywhere .
92217:19	On the theme that India must be free you see .
92259:41	So he placed an order with him for all these , and he had to come back to the factory , reorganize the factory , to meet this terrific order he 'd got for pencils , you see .
92271:9	So he had to go there to Canada you see and er and .
92339:54	When they got to Bridge they , if they had n't got a permit they they had to go back , the pickets 'd be there .
92356:8	People had to get out and they 'd turn the bus over time and time .
92402:32	He 'll be your star turn , you you must see him when you can .
92471:15	And so er they had to go to the workhouse you see and I can see it now in this er this cobbled street and this er cab er drawn by a horse of course , hansom cab .
92511:10	I I must have told you before that what we got er we used to turn and bundle two thousand four hundred , I told you that did n't I ?
92517:17	Why why did the socks have to be turned ?
92541:25	Er well n not really because they had to be in the union .
92580:19	Well , th I I must have told you because it 's one of the things that er stand out that on on the day when they dropped the first bomb in I and I I and it was er it 'd be the thirty first of January , but I do n't know whether it was er fifteen or sixteen , nineteen fifteen or nineteen sixteen .
92633:14	Some of them had to walk because you they they could n't take them in in in any conveyance at all because er it was over what they call the viaducts , you know and the big rushes and reeds , I told you about a chap hitting them did n't I ?
92661:25	I I do n't remember but he must have been .
92739:9	Had had to come out on strike , then er all the workers be on strike fund , er did you and your father receive strike money ?
92763:12	But I 'll have to tell you a bit of my history .
92835:33	Oh well I b , it were , we all had to be in the union anyway and so we used to er we used to go to the meetings a a a you know as youngsters and then when we came back from the Army we 'd got to the union meeting as well .
93031:14	they or you have to get any c casual work , I mean y sort of part-time little jobs ?
93095:24	And what sort of hours did you have to work then ?
93124:188	Because they developed a system of mining , whereby once once it was the the the task had begun to clear the coal face of a certain er a certain area of coal , it did n't matter what what happened during that particular period of time , whether all the machinery broke down , etcetera , etcetera , you had to stop u until that amount of coal had been cleared off , you see .
93167:11	Because it must be thirty two and thirty six , mainly you 'd be talking about would n't it ?
93256:78	I mean did you ever have time for dances , and going to the pictures and that kind of thing , I mean you must have found some time ?
93354:26	Were you given the money or did you have to pay for that yourself ?
93440:17	Exactly why , he must have had some sympathy , must n't he ?
93440:32	Exactly why , he must have had some sympathy , must n't he ?
93487:14	So the political commissar has got to convince you , you see , as to who was responsible for you not having a rifle .
93675:9	So they had to start contacting the er What 's the terminology we use at the moment ?
93809:13	Erm you must have heard of the phrases of poncing , where somebody is operating a prostitute and if they do n't get a required amount of money a week or er er an amount of money where they consider it sufficient , they 'll probably go and beat them up or something like that .
93859:7	You have to .
93982:16	Well we had we had to look into it very carefully .
94018:44	Erm I would n't think so w w it means that we have to get to know the the local clients very well indeed .
94041:19	And the membership , your investors had to actually make the effort to come to you .
94043:49	Erm we 're surrounded by the membership , and it 's actually me which has to go out to visit the estate agents and solicitors and such like .
94055:13	Er we do have to get involved with the community and we just find ourselves drawn into the community without any real problems .
94103:13	And the first priority must be to find them suitable replacement housing .
94109:12	Er new housing has to be a priority in this area I I should have I would think .
94205:7	You must have quite a lot of memories .
94330:10	I 'll have to wait and see .
94357:21	From what i understand you have got to go out of the road to get to get er well this er well whatever it is , this
94392:7	There must be a lot of pride actually in it then Erm
94393:20	It is rather nice I must admit .
94397:7	I must I think it is anyway .
94483:14	Well we sort of had to obviously .
94485:10	We 've had to .
94495:19	Although they are , they must be to the people concerned but I mean , a pet 's usually a dog , cat or bird is n't it ?
94622:91	You know , it 's er it 's got the bad publicity that it had and it 's still got it , well I do n't think it has to be .
94729:9	Well that must mean something .
94900:15	And erm also I have to tell you er our next meeting will be our Christmas party .
94919:59	And God was very good to me there , I was n't the brightest in the year and I had to work very hard , but God always was with me as I always passed my exams much to my surprise .
94920:72	What you do for the first two years is you learn all the theory of being a doctor and you go and you have to between eight of you , learn all about a body you have one body between of you and you learn all about all the muscles and the nerves
94921:23	over a year and you also have to do lots of experiments , you have to learn to take blood pressure on each other , learn to take blood from each other
94921:48	over a year and you also have to do lots of experiments , you have to learn to take blood pressure on each other , learn to take blood from each other
94928:11	and then we had to do experiments on each other like putting tubes through our noses down into our stomachs
94932:14	And erm we had to learn erm how to do heart tracings , ECGs , on each other and er all sorts of exciting things like that .
94933:59	And then , after two years , we were allowed on to the wards in our white coats and we had to erm find out about the patients and initially we were all very slow and we were given two hours to talk to a patient to find out all about them .
94935:36	And I can remember one of my first patients I had to take blood from , and it took me quite a few goes on that poor lady but she 's still friends with me so she 's forgiven me .
94937:38	And then , in the last year , in the fifth year , you have to do and pass all the exams .
94952:203	Erm but down in the Rift Valley the Pocot people were a very different tribe , they wore leather , little tiny leather skirts and cowrie shells and nothing here , and it was very very hot , and they were a nomadic people who erm moved about with their animals but because , when I was there , there 'd been a very bad drought , they 'd had to erm just beg really for food .
94954:14	We used to have to use a generator for our electricity and that used to go off at ten o' clock at night so if there was an operation that needed doing , there were two car batteries that were turned on and you used to have to do it by those .
94954:154	We used to have to use a generator for our electricity and that used to go off at ten o' clock at night so if there was an operation that needed doing , there were two car batteries that were turned on and you used to have to do it by those .
94960:16	The meat used to have to be pressure cooked for four hours to make it tender enough to eat !
94997:62	But erm it 's quite hard if you 've been up a lot at night and then you have to go and do the whole of the next day of work , but fortunately our rotas are n't too bad so we 're never on two nights in a row compared with the hospital which was quite a lot harder work .
95018:9	And you have to pay the little boys to guard your bikes otherwise they let down the tyres .
95024:10	They 'd have to be would n't they ?
95033:30	Apparently what the erm busmen do is they have to make sure that they get to where they 're meant to be on time otherwise they get their pay docked but they like to stop off and see their friends on the way , and stop and have cups of tea
95034:19	so that , when they have to go , they go very very fast and we were advised if we ever went on a bus to sit on the roof
95041:85	And then we did a jungle trek and erm the guide said if I do that you 've come near , if I do that you have to go away , if I do that you 've got to quickly climb a tree
95048:105	And on our way to the crocodile farm erm we past some beautiful countryside , and on the way back one of the two jeeps broke down and after an hour they decided we would have to leave it .
95055:161	When I came back to England I was very humbled really to erm because I arrived in Nepal three hours before that crash and erm a lot of people had thought I 'd died in that crash and erm the patients had thought I 'd died as well and they had to put a big notice outside to say that I 'd been alright , they had lots of people ringing up .
95064:66	You can you go to church every Sunday , sing the choruses or the hymns , listen to what the man has to say or the lady has to say at the front , and it can just go over your head and it can mean nothing to you apart from something that you believe might be true .
95064:86	You can you go to church every Sunday , sing the choruses or the hymns , listen to what the man has to say or the lady has to say at the front , and it can just go over your head and it can mean nothing to you apart from something that you believe might be true .
95065:14	But what you have to do is actually realize that Jesus died for you you have to be sorry for all the things that you 've done wrong and you need to ask him to come into your life and to be your own saviour .
95065:54	But what you have to do is actually realize that Jesus died for you you have to be sorry for all the things that you 've done wrong and you need to ask him to come into your life and to be your own saviour .
95085:82	Some people think that if you lead a good life then you can get to Jesus and get to heaven but Jesus said that you have to come through him .
95144:69	Erm I do look for opportunities to talk to people about God but I , I certainly think that you have to wait for the right opportunity because , if people are ill or very down , then it often is n't the right time when they 're vulnerable erm to try and erm talk to them about something .
95149:162	Often there 's a lot of , that people erm do or do n't do that you , you ca n't erm go along with when people are wanting terminations of pregnancy or , or they 're thinking of leaving their husbands and going off with somebody else then you just have to listen to what they say and put the facts as you see them in front of them .
95180:8	It must , it must cause disease and , and , and trouble must n't it ?
95180:16	It must , it must cause disease and , and , and trouble must n't it ?
95180:44	It must , it must cause disease and , and , and trouble must n't it ?
95403:29	This week is Christian Aid week , and we must ensure that people earn a fair return for their labour .
95450:92	So they er they agree that they have an influence on market prices , but they , they wo n't , are not prepared to pay any more than they have to .
95491:83	But also there 's a the Soviet Union used to grow a lot of its own tea , but it grew it round Chernobyl and it had to start importing a lot of tea .
95554:64	And I would want to know what the health effects were on them of the conditions in which they had to work .
95556:19	I think Nestle have had to change their policy , because they were selling it and advertising it , and it was obviously doing harm to the children .
95557:16	I mean , Nestle had to abandon that .
95762:7	There must have been something .
95818:9	And it must pay no more than a reasonable service fee to agents .
95838:88	That 's something that erm a great many of the multinationals will er try to get round very er and the other , other thing they 'll have to pay fair price which reflects the cost of production and the quality of the product , plus a margin for investment and development .
95952:73	But at an individual le level as well if you want , but no not kind of just it 's not a commitment to have to go away and do something next week .
95969:11	But the prices have got to be more have n't they , if our aim is
95974:15	No , it would have to be a se a separate Traidcraft stall , I think , not the Traidcraft coffee next to the Nestle coffee .
96006:15	I think it has to be alongside the other .
96018:13	In France they have to say
96020:13	in France they have to say where they 've come from .
96021:17	Well , whether they have to in France or not , but I want to know , as a person , whether I am French , English or whatever , I want to know that kind of .
96051:13	Where do you have to put the cocoa on , there is n't an oven down there ?
96068:27	Erm well we decided that we would have to erm try and live more simply erm that was the only way that er erm this would work .
96069:58	I if the producing countries are going to get more for their products , we 're going to have to take less .
96070:17	We 're going to have to eat less .
96071:15	Erm we 'll have to consider our own lifestyles , and erm try and set a good example .
96155:7	You have to have cars .
96164:36	I , I go because I , I feel I must support the shop , but I could n't possibly do my family shopping there .
96210:57	Well , in theory up to an extent you are the answer which means that we have to buy less things , eat less , and , because we are you know that , I mean , I mean n I do n't want to , I mean I 'm not talking to anyone in particular , but we have a lot of very very big people and .
96276:33	With Waitrose down south and Sainsburys round the corner they have to .
96283:13	Do n't they all have to follow national policy ?
96326:9	And that must have some extremely dubious coffee in it .
96330:50	So if there 's any other business then we could , it 's going to have to be fairly quick .
96443:13	Yes you 've had to do intervals in oral tests
96447:9	Did you have to go as far as that ?
96548:14	and , but you must call it D double flat .
96551:4	must have , if it has n't got another letter name then it 's not a second is it ?
96589:16	As you do n't have to go through a minor interval just go one semitone lower and
96614:9	Do you have to go through the minor ?
96643:21	Then of course you do n't have to worry about the octave .
96694:29	That 's right but do n't forget it must be
96720:12	Right you just have to remember that whatever key you 're in , you 've got to remember the sharps or flats from that key .
96725:24	Er if you er if you had to have an augmented fourth what would you do ?
96729:27	If you had a key signature you would have to remember to make that a natural would n't you ?
96774:15	But I 've never had to use them .
96780:15	But I 've never had to worry about them so I , I 've never really got on and learnt them .
97058:26	you 're , you 're going to have to write two quavers and tie them .
97080:10	The sound must still be the same but you 've got to alter the notes for grouping purposes .
97188:23	Because you 're not going to have to go back on many of the things .
97264:27	Which means that you 're unlikely to have to have quite so many ledger line notes .
97298:15	Just means you have to get used to thinking , right if that 's if , if that 's er er a tenor clef then that note wo n't be it would be , be an A in a bass clef and F in a treble clef .
97390:7	You have to know an awful lot you know for grade five .
97392:19	You , you do n't have to , need to know anything in , in depth but you 've got to know
97448:68	And er coming here I found that I had n't er put any of my vases in , so I had to go back again .
97530:10	That 'll have to move .
97686:20	As I grow chrysanths we have to do erm I 'm not getting the right word .
97734:22	Now goes missing , we 'll have to give her a shout .
97780:11	I 've had to , this cupboard 's because it 's got cutlery and the plates and that , so I 've just put a piece of er material over it .
97821:32	And I was just saying I 'm going to have to go down there .
97875:143	if we get packets sent The butchers If you get one thing set in your mind what you 're going to do , and you know , you go off to get it , and then er if you do n't manage it , then you have to start again .
97917:15	I think you have to round all your friends and family you know Nice Yorkshire flowers .
97930:77	Erm because when I was a little girl my brother and I we used to flowers because my mother sold flowers and we would have to deliver them .
97946:9	So I have to tie it up .
98053:10	Now you have to have what a European style .
98069:10	I just have to this crescent there .
98085:39	I think this is the Connecticut King I 'm going to have to make a corner there .
98094:34	Now what I want to do is er I have to set this you know and find a venue to go to .
98230:10	They 'll have to go that side .
98234:37	trying to make it balance all afternoon so I had to start it yesterday to make it balance .
98264:10	I might have to hold on to it You 'll have to get people to you know .
98264:37	I might have to hold on to it You 'll have to get people to you know .
98388:37	So to achieve a , a sort of given result you have to work much harder .
98396:22	But in the psychological area you do have to use it , you know quite a lot of the time .
98408:39	Erm and er the other thing about it is that although we have to look at , in order to discover the preference , we have to look at each dimension as a discrete entity , once you 've found the preferences , they actually have a dynamic relationship with each other .
98408:76	Erm and er the other thing about it is that although we have to look at , in order to discover the preference , we have to look at each dimension as a discrete entity , once you 've found the preferences , they actually have a dynamic relationship with each other .
98553:73	Erm I once , talking to somebody about this and er he said erm , well he said I think I must be an intuitive because I 've never let the facts get in the way of a good idea .
98557:9	The ideas have to come from the facts .
98902:39	That 's how you are and that 's how you have to start .
98984:68	Well I think for them to be in , in management , top management positions a lot of them they 'd have to be pretty sensing and thinking before well I do I mean I think there 's
99029:14	Erm well you have to sort of decide I suppose erm which way you wanna go .
99035:43	You know but , but probably to start with whatever you 're gonna have to do you 're gonna have to do .
99035:63	You know but , but probably to start with whatever you 're gonna have to do you 're gonna have to do .
99084:55	to actually create the right learning environment for them , there were a thousand little details that I had to attend to , like had I planned my lesson right , was I progressing in the right way round the classroom , had I remembered to chase up certain people 's homework , and stuff .
99093:23	You know I mean you have to have time management skills to have a reasonably
99103:25	And I mean I su everyone has to resign themselves I think to some extent but the fact that they are playing a role within their work situation .
99109:15	You know I had to assume this more detached role .
99116:63	And you know and you , you , you got to have , gotta get , you know , you have to get cross with them if they misbehave or whatever because otherwise there is n't any order in the place .
99118:32	An an and you know those sorts of things have to go on .
99221:10	You 'll have to give me ano
99594:44	Now , no more than three of these in a day , and you must stay on it for at least a month .
99662:14	Well I did n't have to wait too long for you today .
99673:13	I 've always had to do everything .
99729:57	Now your knee 'll be sore , when you start doing it , because you , this muscle has to get strengthened up again .
99866:23	Now the one thing you 'll have to watch excuse me excuse me , with these tablets , is anything with alcohol in it .
99978:7	You must be getting old .
100049:8	You must , I mean she
100082:22	So I mean that day we had to tell a lot of lies , you know , like that .
100102:14	so they did n't have to go through this bit
100157:15	fright the white coats must have frightened the life out of you some .
100371:12	What I have to do is find a good bit .
100786:114	I did mention that er I 'm a retired tax inspector and I 'm very long retired , I 've been retired for thirteen years , thoroughly enjoying it , hope you too but your first questions w must be what the devil am I doing thirteen years retired tax inspector talking to you on a technical subject , why on earth ca n't you get the real thing ?
100789:9	So they had to pull pa back people like me from retirement .
100801:14	Now your second question must be where do I get my information from , how do I keep up to date ?
100819:26	Thoroughly recommend all , you do n't have to be members , we , we are members of the magazine club , because all these are available in local libraries .
100839:28	Incidentally I always do this and yet I must reassure you that I 'm not a Saga representative in anyway , I 'm just keen on , on Saga and their facilities .
100850:15	Right , now I must n't be seen to be indicating in any way that er you do n't have to bother with it all , because they too put all out some excellent er booklets , brochures I 've got two thick pads of them which I 'll let you circulate .
100850:63	Right , now I must n't be seen to be indicating in any way that er you do n't have to bother with it all , because they too put all out some excellent er booklets , brochures I 've got two thick pads of them which I 'll let you circulate .
100856:69	So the revenue themselves do er a really good information service and if you go into any tax office , you do n't have to go to the counter , there 's often a queue or you get this little card system which , number system you 're , you 're next .
100878:152	In , prior to ninety one ninety two which is three years prior to now , a married woman was entitled to the same as that , it was , they did n't call it basic allowance , the same amount only if she was married of course and working , it had to be earned income .
100890:23	Well this is the risk you have to take but er , and it 's a , it 's a profit at this stage where er people are coming up to receiving lump sums in retirement and wonder how best to invest it , well seems to me there 's no better investment than to , than to put it into tax free sources that you have available to you .
100898:8	It has to be an account in the wife 's name , it has to be a genuine transfer to a wife so that there 's no doubt about it but it is a on her account .
100898:42	It has to be an account in the wife 's name , it has to be a genuine transfer to a wife so that there 's no doubt about it but it is a on her account .
100900:9	Does anyone have to pay any tax say on building society ?
100973:177	So straight away you see what 's happened in this case his code becomes two eighty one H whereas previously we 've got quite a high code and yet his total income is er not er comparative to the change in code numbers and this is what has that effect , that all that tax on all this income has to be collected against his works pension , thereby causing a lot of confusion and difficulty for er people becoming retired .
100992:61	So the advice is , and I 'm not an investment advisor , it 's because of the exemption you must always take advantage of all tax exempt forms of savings before you look at anything else .
101023:5	have to be careful because I 'm not an investment advisor , I 'm simply talking about the benefits of the tax exemption .
101060:48	Now suppleness is the most important , but when you 've got that you have to go for something else before you even can grow the stamina , and that is strength , the power of the muscle to produce the body action , resist gravity and work against resistance .
101063:7	Care must be taken to start from each individual 's capability .
101065:8	You must start , you forget there where he is or she is , but you 've got to start from your actual capacity otherwise you 're in danger in that .
101118:55	But can you see the people who came to the stepping stones and could n't go across and had to go back the way they 'd already come would n't go back with a very their ego would n't have b been boosted very high .
101147:45	Now I always think of that as stamina cos I think that must have been a terrific stamina thing .
101148:7	He must have felt it and he must have suffered afterwards from it I would imagine , but he had , he had those qualifications , he had those abilities and he used them for a .
101148:30	He must have felt it and he must have suffered afterwards from it I would imagine , but he had , he had those qualifications , he had those abilities and he used them for a .
101164:76	Now jogging does n't give power to the big muscles of the body , it does n't do that so again you 'd you 'd have to be doing something which , that built up the power .
101180:23	Can you see how variable it has to be , because you 've got about everything in there .
101261:197	Other people would hate that , it 's too restricting and er er and again it is , if you think about it , because if you 've got a , a regular date and you 're retired and something nice and exciting comes up , and that 's right in the middle of your , it bashes into your regular date , so then you have to say do I go or do I do or , or do n't I ?
101267:7	I have to work every Wednesday night , every week and one Sunday a month in the dance school .
101273:238	Erm but you will be in that position , you may be so dedicated about something that you want to do like I did , I thoroughly enjoyed it it 's given me a great deal of pleasure , I 've worked with about a hundred different people over the years that have been in my dance group , all ages all personalities , we 've worked with some fantastic music which er erm we 've had to interpret .
101284:14	Erm but again you have got to decide what it is you want out of your retirement because you 're the boss and it 's no good moaning when you 're into your retirement that it does n't suit you because you 've planned it , you 've made the decisions and therefore it 's up to you to alter whatever you do n't like .
101310:31	And of course it then , in the end you have to say oh well I 'd like to but I do n't think my legs are equal to it .
101315:134	When my rheumatoid arthritis was very bad it has been very bad and very chronic , and it still can be some days , erm I had more ways of getting up and down those stairs and I got up and down , but I had to invent ways to do it .
101321:32	But there will come a time when you may have to think about it .
101337:17	But er I , I have to make quite sure that my arms will take my weight , as near as one can .
101342:21	Oh o oh yes it does n't have to be something heavy
101371:52	Er there 's the general insurance side which is based in Bournemouth and you may have had to contact them on previous occasions for quotations for motor and er house insurance , that sort of thing .
101404:26	But , er I think a golden rule must be , when you 're looking at financial er matters is er make sure you know who you 're dealing with .
101407:11	Any major broker must be in the U K because er er they are exposed to the public view if you like , and if there are any errors or , or deceptions then they 're likely to come up very quickly .
101408:22	So erm a golden er rule must be , avoid small operators
101442:15	I think these have got to be slightly updated with a new er with the new rates that have come through , cos that was right on six four ninety two .
101448:114	And er with that in mind , it 's possible that people do want to top up their income , because the one thing I will stress to you is that you do n't want to have to start having to back-pedal er when you retire .
101500:97	You 've got a form R eighty five which is available for bank and building society investors , and if you 've got er a gross account then er you , you have to agree with the revenue that you are not going to be a taxpayer in the year that you take out the er R eighty five .
101511:71	Cos I was using that issue at that time , but we always make the proviso that if things change , you may have to alter your mind about where your money 's placed .
101540:9	Do you have to give the capital sum to create this income , or is there ways of income from a set sum of money to the other person ?
101547:23	So really erm er you 'd have to be a bit careful if you were doing that , and er I think the revenue would be pretty iffy about you holding money and paying it to a third party .
101636:76	the account into which it 's paid , does that account into which the three four four five interest is paid , does that have to be in my wife 's name , or does it have to be a joint
101636:109	the account into which it 's paid , does that account into which the three four four five interest is paid , does that have to be in my wife 's name , or does it have to be a joint
101641:26	I thought you see it would have to be in her name , because she has
101647:56	And I think what Bob is saying , there is only one account , but you 'll have to endow two accounts , one that is giving rise to interest in the wife 's name ,
101656:12	It does n't have to be .
101663:39	I thought that if it went into a joint account , I had to pay tax on half of three four four five .
101739:36	Now that twenty thousand pounds can be paid er it has to be paid before probate is granted .
101740:53	So there 'd be delay in probate unless the children have got the money , so they have to borrow against the property or they have to raise money to pay the bill .
101740:77	So there 'd be delay in probate unless the children have got the money , so they have to borrow against the property or they have to raise money to pay the bill .
101809:90	And Norwich would be delighted if you cashed early , because that means that their pool , their , their main fund is not at is not going to have to pay you any terminal bonus .
101848:35	And some of them actually cha make sure that you have to keep your house and contents insured through the society , which again can be more expensive .
101874:182	But this is the interest rate dip we 're in here , I mean we 've seen , we 've seen I reckon we 're somewhere around here , we could be either side of that , but I think what we 're going to find next year is that the Chancellor , because he 's had to keep interest rates low and he 's stimulating the economy , er you 're going to find that eventually he 's going to have to push interest rates up to control inflation .
101874:259	But this is the interest rate dip we 're in here , I mean we 've seen , we 've seen I reckon we 're somewhere around here , we could be either side of that , but I think what we 're going to find next year is that the Chancellor , because he 's had to keep interest rates low and he 's stimulating the economy , er you 're going to find that eventually he 's going to have to push interest rates up to control inflation .
101878:17	And inter interest rates will have to come up to control er the rate of inflation , if the government pursues its normal course .
101974:33	Yeah , you ca n't really defer your pension you have to take it when you retire , do n't you ?
101987:39	No no let 's assume , let 's assume that she has to take it .
102089:85	Erm if you 're buying an endowment policy is it possible to put er put it in as it were paid up , or do you have to find the premiums out of your income ?
102101:22	In which case she does n't have to worry about funding from income , which is what your question was was n't it ?
102103:12	She does n't have to fund it from income .
102124:20	So I mean she 'd have to be a very speculative investor , she 'd have to be right up to er adventurous , for her to think about that .
102124:50	So I mean she 'd have to be a very speculative investor , she 'd have to be right up to er adventurous , for her to think about that .
102125:46	Er but I mean as , as to returns , I mean you 'd have to look at specialist press for that erm
102183:94	It was n't Lloyds fault , it was just that they were complying with the original P E P regulations about reporting and , and er so on , so they had to charge more .
102256:18	I think we 'd have to ignore that allowance
102286:27	Erm you know the , the answer must be that erm er just before I answer that , I mean has anybody else done Mrs , and Mr ?
102359:10	We 'd have to put most of it into investment trusts
102377:93	So , er there 's a fair bit of er I was interested in what you said about equity portfolios , erm the er thing is you 'd have to have that privately managed , would n't you ?
102384:40	A s and , and quite frankly , er you 're going to have to be a little bit careful .
102454:58	And then I , and I made this bit of a faux pas , I says , oh you must have got a very good rate , cos I knew she 'd been retired years and years , you see .
102471:50	Er right , so er if you take just one more example and then I 'll have to get back to er what we do .
102522:13	And that it has to be paid before probate is granted .
102751:29	No that 's no problem , except that you must know who you 're talking to .
102787:21	Er but we 're not I must explain we 're not discretionary managers .
102882:44	But if you 've used a , a room at home , then you have to watch the capital gains situation , because if it 's your residence , then for capital gains purposes when you sell it , it 's exempt from income tax .
102889:31	There 's no real I mean you 'd have to be in a real big way of a business and use a large proportion of your house for the gain on that proportion to exceed five thousand eight hundred .
102891:14	But nevertheless , we have to say that it 's so .
102966:24	So this is the thing you have to have to bear in mind .
102966:31	So this is the thing you have to have to bear in mind .
102993:15	And I , I must admit , it left me somewhat confused .
102994:63	And can I b make it quite clear , that if you transfer assets into your wife 's name , it has to be a pucker transfer into her name .
102996:12	And therefore it has to be a separate account .
103016:7	It has to be a genuine transfer of an asset .
103017:7	It has to be in her name .
103074:15	I think they must in the van .
103104:58	Yes and also take long long time if you do the sort of volume of work that I have to do .
103217:7	You have to exit from that first if you want to
103405:10	We 'll have to get back into WordPerfect and load your file .
103649:7	You have to do everything twice in this .
103656:10	Now we have to press enter again .
103711:11	which you must n't touch unless you 're very sure of what you 're doing .
103842:7	You have to read what 's at the bottom .
103942:9	And you have to come into it .
104260:17	Right so we 'll have to come back to keyboard and you can change it , I think .
104273:9	And you have to insert it before where you 've got the cursor .
104381:9	So you have to change that deliberately by typing a Y .
104718:150	One of a family of six and me elder brother was me bro me dad had a little business in the keys in and er they were hard times and me elder brother we used to go and work for him because me dad said he must and er from , after school I used to go and perhaps do the errands or a bit of filing , the odd jobs and all that sort of thing and I grew up with locks and keys and files from twelve , even before I left school .
104727:85	Started at that 's right , yes and er I did and er they put me in the machine shop filing keyhole and Those times they had to be all cast over the rim locks and all that , now they 've made for us and all that .
104732:9	So I had to work with him till I was about twenty or twenty-one or something like that , you know .
104745:9	So I had to serve a week 's notice and I went down this er what 's the name of it ?
104756:70	Mind you these was instructions from the office to me , telling me what I , what they wanted and I had to carry it out .
104758:7	they had to sell them for three and threepence , three farthings .
104791:89	So I went down and Mr at that time was Mayor of Willenhall , a very influential man , and he was er over and er his son had to became in charge , but anyway I went to see him it was Mr and er about it and he says er well we got er a order for four locks here , he says er I wonder if er you could quote me for them ?
104803:145	and er in the piece of property at the back of the pub , down the opposite side of the road , down a lane you went on to and there was a football field , couple of football fields there and prior to this , they 'd have to if they could use this little place as a stripping room and he said yes .
104805:97	So I worked down here and nights up there preparing it and all round this , this place was coat hooks and that , where they all hung their things and I had to knock them down , you know what I mean , and fix me own benches up and er I 'd got a little treadle lather and er sufficient for me to start .
104816:32	And in no time at all , I did n't have to ask for jobs , I 'd got more than I could do , you know and er I was still , very well taken care of in the shop .
104817:84	It was a lovely shop , bought it up here up But , me brother left the brew left the pub and er it meant that I had to get out you know .
104822:88	I cleared that and fixed the vice up and they said I could do that and I used the and that in their place and er then they had to quit the premises completely , did n't they ?
104826:8	they had to come out and
104836:46	I 'll tell you about that in a minute and then er I er had to go about forty times for permission .
104838:42	But this premise was there at that time and by oh I had to go to a great extent on a number of visits and they er granted it me on compassionate grounds and there 's er I was only looking in the back of there the other day and there 's one there now .
104841:49	I had er I sent the dimensions to the firm at Oxon and er I had to go to the bank and borrow the money , because you see the money I paid if I do n't pay cash I 'd gotta have six months delivery .
104854:88	please understand me , but no thousands of Pounds is er taxable , see what I mean they 've never , I should never applied and they had to send about oh above twenty returns , yearly return .
104865:71	About thirty in each suite to differ and a master key and as I say there was five suites and they had to make a key that 'd open everyone of the fifty-five .
104868:9	I had to keep more or less the leverage more or less the same because you could n't differ them and er I er had that job to er do for and er it was the H M S Gothic and they was going to South Africa and er when er they was on , in the middle of South Africa on the coast one of the royalty died .
104872:19	Her father died and they had to come back from their , this particular and come back .
104885:9	Doctor had to fit , fetch a little parcel
104895:282	Cos it was due to sail on the same day , on the Sunday , you know what I mean and er it was these locks as I 'm telling you about and her a very , very famous firm and er my correspondence come from London because he had offices was there , you know and erm our erm I 've been at the service as I , if I might say so , but in most people it 's surprising how it get 's round and er the jobs that I 've had to do .
104900:129	But it was for the lock from the people , you know and he , he got round like this , and this is the God 's truth as well again , he 'd come to me from America and er they , I had to make locks for certain people they called them statos , status symbols there , in their own houses , you know , where they put this lock on and anybody as he 's got one like that , you know and from America to Dick in Willenhall to make them .
104929:85	I made four locks for the gates on Lord 's cricket ground er and when I 'm telling you this , and practically without exception , they must 've er got to know me and they come for what they wanted .
104998:24	I think at that time you had to pay for it , but you could go and have ten minutes , sommat like that , and a cup of tea .
105000:77	But there was always them as just wanted to come and do nothing and pick the money up and that 's what they had to sort out the firms .
105018:75	Well , er the reason was erm technique and science and they 'd , they all the firms or who was in business had to make locks their own way , you know what I mean and use the best facilities they could get hold of , but science and progress came into being and they cou they made what you could call locks erm repetition .
105039:66	when you wanted to do something with the keys or operate er horizontal , there was a machine and you had to go to the do it yourself .
105083:68	Yes er that 's been the essence of what I 've wanted is er I 've , I 've had to have what I 've wanted by hook or by crook , and I do n't mean crook in a bad sense , I mean one way or another , you know what I mean and er I did job for the casters , same as they did jobs for me , you know and that 's how I 've gone through life , that is Michael .
105101:19	They 'd they 'd have to be filed before you used them , would they ?
105103:15	Michael , I 've had to work very , very exact my lad and these things I 'd got the sliding gages and put them on and they 'd been the same at the front as they have at the back and that 's the thickness as well .
105117:43	But in , in a lot of instances , to answer you , I had to use me ingenuity .
105142:45	There was fifty and there was five levers and three lifts and I had to get a piece of paper and er make a , when you get one , two , three and then five you could have er three , three , two , one and five , four , three , two , one , you know what I mean ?
105144:10	And I had to make all these er computations out and er I made fifty that I thought nobody could pick .
105147:50	They only used to ever lock the door from the outside and er I er had to make er fifty and as I say , number them one up to fifty and er then they 'd perhaps on a odd occasion they sent me an order for one , the number the number
105148:29	and then , then your metal you used to have to had n't you ?
105155:220	And when I er went to go on me own er I still wanted to keep in the union and I went down the Locksmiths ' union , which was in the market place , and they said they er we could n't , we could n't have you in the union if you go on your own erm there 's another denomination or something , was something that you 'd have to join or something like that and be on your own .
105156:197	Well er when I er , when I er , I could n't remember much what it was now , but whatever the union fee was , when I started on me own to be er satisfied of cos of circumstances I might need money , you know , I thought it would say the union fee was a shilling , I had to pay one and six half as much as whatever it was and I did do .
105166:15	And I er I had to er see a solicitor or something .
105170:8	I had to pay some money , I just forget now , very little but er as I 've said half a dozen times now , I always wanted to do what was right , you know , and I aim to do that .
105288:7	There must have been more than twenty curriers Nowadays there are no tanneries and there are only three curriers So the answer to your question is yes , many , many more .
105322:9	But one has to bear in mind that it is always possible that you could have other materials for riding and so on .
105352:53	But the frame I think was a bit dodgy but it , we , we never had to have anything done at it .
105368:102	But erm as I say , they did er , the people did but you never got nothing off the government for it and er , I 've always said it , he must have been a much better man than I thought he was because er , er , to go as I say from what it was in those days to start his own business and that .
105370:43	I think , when I think it since , I think he must have been a remarkable man to work and slave like that .
105372:81	Now , cos I mean do n't forget originally we used to take milk out twice a day , morning and night , because you had to fetch it from the farm .
105374:8	We had to make and we used to have to take this milk , I used to take it about five o' clock in the morning .
105374:32	We had to make and we used to have to take this milk , I used to take it about five o' clock in the morning .
105377:192	I used to take about , around about four , four to five gallons , which er , I could er , like erm , carry it down there like to them , you know and er , and then you got out Cos in the ori original days , when I first started as a kid with him , we used to have to take it out morning and night , people , mostly the factory owners and we , we had er , had er having twice a day .
105380:47	Oh I , when I , when I went there the next morning I had to tell all in front of the class and tell all the kids .
105404:63	Not because I could n't have had a holiday only that er we had loads of milk so we had to go and fetch it from the farms and you gotta have somebody to take it out .
105444:43	Because in them days er I , I think most of us had to , had to do some work .
105444:54	Because in them days er I , I think most of us had to , had to do some work .
105448:7	I had to take his part although he was older than me .
105456:126	The first thing I never went to the doctor with when I , I tumbled off the wall down cut me head open and that 's the only , and then after I got used to playing football they must 've , have put a steel inset into your head the way I head that ball .
105462:127	Lancashire they used to call it and , we used to , they used to set one on at first and then , as he knocked , if he could knock one off his feet onto his two feet , then he had to help him to knock the others over as they come in close and er , I know they do n't sound nothing like , you know , now but er , in them days we use to think it was great .
105524:35	Cos , you used to work for the castronery had to pay you see , not the firm .
105525:7	You had to , we worked for the castronery at the back .
105526:7	They had to pay you see .
105531:138	Th there was sort of decorations on the saddles and things like that you know , and er , er , they had this firm and it was up of course , well , and it , to tell how far it was I had to be in by seven o' clock and I used to run it all the way .
105534:25	Well again , I , I , I had to do it as a kid but I did n't afterwards but er , I er , tell you about this chap and I even went back and told him .
105549:9	Did you have to fetch the milk fresh each morning ?
105550:47	Oh yes , but it wa was down er ha had it from until they had to close down .
105556:146	Ooh gosh and me dad yes , he used to do er , er , er , just a , he did n't do , do too many but he , he had , like a sort of a push truck like , you know and he has to go up and that , that only round not too far and he , he like to do it I think more .
105577:29	There was n't a broadway of course , you must remember this before I tell you see .
105633:59	Like tying a bottle on the door and sticking it on the window and knock the door and they had to come , crash the bottle would go .
105686:70	I , I of course , I suppose going round with milk I 'd perhaps got more confidence th cos I had to take milk whether I wanted to or not , see and we if we got down there and there was two or three of the conductresses down the fleck and er , jump on a Dalston bus cos I 'd got to get to like , you know .
105785:9	So I had to they said oh you were the shop steward .
105787:22	There was time when they had to bribe er , give some sort of er incentive to the foreman to give them a good time , then it was the shop stewards who would give the workers to the management who will do the o overtime .
105800:85	Erm but erm then due to certain reasons of erm er it was again er bit of struggle between myself and my colleague and er I had to choose to leave .
105846:17	I said well there must be some reason ?
105853:7	You must be very proud of him .
105904:44	I , I do hesitate myself because if I walk around normally I have to suffer a lot of abuse by , not by , people by who are walking round , but the people who are passing by in the cars etc .
105905:92	And youngsters normally er when , when they pass by , they will certainly say , at your back , something nasty and so er there is no way just have to an tolerate it unless , until we want to end up in , behind the bars .
105907:142	Erm it has become worse in a way that er we did , I did experience some sort of er , er racial intolerance er with the youth , but the middle-aged and the er m older people were very , very er tolerant I had to ask er when I could n't find my way , ask my way to certain places and er there was an that er the lady just walked by me er with me and she , she said I 'll have to walk with you you ca n't find it .
105907:269	Erm it has become worse in a way that er we did , I did experience some sort of er , er racial intolerance er with the youth , but the middle-aged and the er m older people were very , very er tolerant I had to ask er when I could n't find my way , ask my way to certain places and er there was an that er the lady just walked by me er with me and she , she said I 'll have to walk with you you ca n't find it .
105908:78	So she was going to the opposite direction actually , and I insisted that I do n't want to take her that long she would have to walk back again .
105941:49	So we teach our daughters that er , er , the first and foremost duty they have to perform in life is to like after your husband and elders and bring up the family , and the economical side , contribution from the er female is secondary , although they claim it a part as well , erm as economically as well .
105972:10	Well we have to keep variety to make something .
105995:135	I think they did , yeah Because I do n't get much time during the day er to go away from the shop but er I , the only job I mostly do is when the visitors come to the er temple I have to go there explain about Sikhism .
106007:154	We 've been feeling for some time that our children are feeling that they 've been left alone , because er when they come to the temple they are too young to understand anything which is being explained from the stage , because er the speakers , or the preachers , have to cater for all the age groups and normally it 's for the , those who understand , already understand about Sikhism .
106027:7	I had to repeat very simple sentences , six , seven , eight , ten times before they could repeat it .
106063:147	I 'd say oh yes , you know but , still could n't get me to go in the Guild and er , it was so strange that the , I ca n't remember , I think I 've been in the Guild about twenty-five years so you 'll have to do your own little sum .
106078:22	Er , I think really it must 've been thrift .
106107:70	It was and yet , I 'm losing my thread with , what I was going to say was , it must 've been so important because an in that you could get anything you liked .
106146:74	I 've only gone since er , erm you know I say Michael 'd be seventeen you know , it must be like twenty years er you know .
106156:170	You got a very good committee , dedicated committee erm who , you see the young trainees were sent to the technical colleges and you see , erm some of them did go on if they graduated to Stanford Hall , but I mean those that went to technical college , we used to have to get the committee to sit in at the examinations .
106157:7	We had to pay the lads their bus fares and er the things like , when they went to college .
106160:197	And we used to go to town , we used to have really good , good er good day erm we used to have a procession and erm local , course local dignitaries used to come er , I I 've got a , one or two pictures in my scrapbook where erm it , I was asking , telling Jean she would have to look up er when we did begin trendsetters .
106202:82	I 've been to Stanford Hall where they have you in a circle but at least , I think , wh however you sit , you must have a president in front of you in a chair and someone to keep a little bit of order .
106208:27	Er one of the rules is you must belong to the Co-op you , you know and er you must have a Pound share in the Co-op you see .
106208:65	Er one of the rules is you must belong to the Co-op you , you know and er you must have a Pound share in the Co-op you see .
106209:9	And you must also have , have that , naturally , before you can be on the committee .
106220:18	Er we still er we have to submit to Miss officer .
106225:28	And to qualify for that grant , you have got to submit two er your programme for the year and you 've gotta give the secretaries , you 've got to give a report and you 've got to give your balance sheet and er , Jean is always , I must say , very pleased with mine because erm you know , we do give quite a lot to charity .
106225:156	And to qualify for that grant , you have got to submit two er your programme for the year and you 've gotta give the secretaries , you 've got to give a report and you 've got to give your balance sheet and er , Jean is always , I must say , very pleased with mine because erm you know , we do give quite a lot to charity .
106234:197	You 're not , you 've not got your councillors coming forward and er you know that , which , which I would like because the , the only way you 'll get your , get anything is by sort of working for it and erm we are very proud you know , I do n't know whether you 've , you must 've seen the book you know erm the , the was brought out the centenary , the eighty-three and er , I mean er , er there 's an awful lot of information there .
106258:227	But the , you see if you look in the , I have information off the Birmingham secretary , er Secretary 's secretary , she was involved , she even was imprisoned in Switzerland erm when the peace movement was on between the two wars , and that was when they were , I believe it was a German woman that er that was on , you know in the committee , but I 'll have to refer to the Caring and Sharing book .
106305:7	That must 've hit Walsall Wood as a mining village .
106383:11	And it must be , I 've been up here twenty-three years , it must be getting on for thirty years old that teapot and er I could n't have afforded that money for that stainless steel teapot , as those days , but I had it with my divi .
106383:45	And it must be , I 've been up here twenty-three years , it must be getting on for thirty years old that teapot and er I could n't have afforded that money for that stainless steel teapot , as those days , but I had it with my divi .
106395:10	Erm I must say that on the clothing scene , because I did criticize it in my earlier statements , er that when I was so young I thought it was so frumpy and I was so pleased when I was married and got my own income that , you know , I could go elsewhere and choose something .
106480:19	But why why should we all have to pay more money for water ?
106491:14	And the standards we have to meet are rigorously laid down regulations .
106492:7	We have to meet fifty six different standards for the quality of water .
106533:7	We have to publish public registers .
106611:40	He 's the guy who said , The escalation of prices has got to stop .
106704:13	But we 'll have to find an answer by the years two thousand , because the way the legislation 's written , means that by the year two thousand we can no longer use rateable value .
106760:61	But if you have a problem with your water , in terms of taste or the quality , then you must phone us up .
106783:7	We had to boost up chlorine levels actually , to meet E C directives .
106787:12	But we did have to boost up chlorine levels in areas , because they were n't high enough .
106830:7	We have to compete obviously .
106861:15	I mean they had to abandon the bore-hole .
106863:7	You have to prevent these substances entering into the ground waters .
106870:7	there must be quite a number of houses in this category
106882:69	Is there any possibility of going to a separate system and using er non potable water for all these other activities which must take up about seventy five or eighty percent of the quantities ?
106918:8	It has to be fitted in accordance with the bye-laws erm and we give out advice on where it should be fitted .
107019:98	there was n't really There was n't really a great deal of er sort of stuff here but it was more about sort of language and shifts so I had to like shift through it and find the bits
107031:82	Er if we 're to understand the dynamics of language in our density and how it exists in the minds of ordinary speakers we must consider the real life record .
107096:36	Judging occupational suitability presumes a hierarchy and what this is must be determined erm differently for every culture being investigated .
107245:46	But there are costs involved as well and these include the increased effort you have to make in conversation erm and loss of perceived integrity and personal group identity sacrificing yourself to match up to them .
107270:68	Which was to like actually do an experiment which might be a bit time consuming now and you might have to do
107292:9	and people have got to be aware of their prejudices
107317:9	Would you have to say why ?
107319:46	Well I think if you can come up with some suggestions you do n't have to say why .
107341:15	I suppose you have to into something linguistic then ?
107342:9	And you have to work out what they mean by that .
107466:41	It 's not your list of choices it 's not going to have to take box form .
107490:5	have to put something they 're gonna have prejudices and
107505:17	Okay what Do we have to do a methodology project as well ?
107516:12	We 're gonna have to be doing that at the same time .
107524:13	What do we have to do ?
107525:10	We just have to write one side on the rational and one side on the method and the third side 's on the results .
107541:27	Okay so we You 're really gonna have to sort of do
107547:58	to the questionnaire er but we definitely have done finish finished making the questionnaire I mean gonna have to
107608:55	I suppose that really , probably is Friday week three but , I do n't suppose it has to be .
107635:117	Then we go to the taboo language and if you talk about when you go to the toilet , if you Everybody excuses themselves to leave and that 's both men and women and then somehow you have to say where you 're going , so the women are more likely to use the polite sort of euphemistic kinds of things like they 'd say toilet or loo , whereas the men are more likely to say bog .
107673:63	so it would n't be that they interruptions listening necessarily it would just be that would n't expect to have to .
107760:9	and they had to say which were said by men and which were said by women , and erm most of the ones with tag questions were said by women
107764:53	I mean some people say it diffidence some people say it 's considerate so you have to then try and go a bit further beyond the actual differences to find out what the reasons behind them are .
107831:53	There Oh that 's why we 're not doing it any more , so what do we have to do instead of having to do an essay ?
107845:15	I think I must be not looking at the list or not reading half the stuff .
107893:40	But obviously if you 're going to do that you 'll have to do it during next week some time On the other hand I could give you a list of five topics and you could choose one .
107895:153	Say one about interrupting , one about topics , and one about perhaps interaction with children , one about er what Or you could even I mean if I did er I did a list of that you could even do the same one , you would n't have to do one each .
107927:108	Is that alright , cos then you 've gone away with any ideas you 've got from now which is probably none , er and then it also means that I do n't have to spend next week worrying in case we get to Friday and Thursday and you 're still not sure what you 're doing .
108200:52	If it does n't go to the main group , it wo n't be and we may have to do something ourselves .
108279:54	Cos if it was as long as three hours , then I 'd expect Julie would have had to program them in for it would n't she .
108316:14	Because I know have to go to Dorothy ' s provincial council .
108363:30	I do n't but it 's lying it must be lying on my desk .
108389:22	Erm so that we may well have to link in to the training programme and go back and check , for instance in three where I 've talked about the business plans .
108398:12	So we 'll have to I think keep going back to these throughout the year and saying , Are we erm are we doing it
108465:14	Anyway we 'll have to , I think , revisit those nine points as w as we go on because that 's
108468:58	Obviously then we need to pick up the appraisal system , and I think what I 'll have to do with that , is as the targets kep co start coming in , erm we 'll have to set up some sort of system , preferably I suspect computerized .
108468:115	Obviously then we need to pick up the appraisal system , and I think what I 'll have to do with that , is as the targets kep co start coming in , erm we 'll have to set up some sort of system , preferably I suspect computerized .
108484:18	But anyway the idea we have to fix up some sort of system that picks up the the targets from that .
108499:12	But we obviously have to do it , just for the the levels of job .
108500:54	Erm so we 've maybe got a dozen to do for the service , and I 'll have to look at that and and go from there .
108503:46	Erm on the back I think for each course we 'll we 'll have to try and fill in .
108658:68	And I think in terms of justifying that , if we had that you know , if you 're saying people have to justify why they 're going , I think they 'd all more or less say the same .
108819:10	We 'll have to look again , it 's interesting with the nationally recognized qualifications and records for life bit , that we already do some of this .
108834:22	If you 're that advanced you have to pay for yourself .
108905:23	Well eventually I think we 'll have to get to that to that standard .
108908:22	And I 'll I 'll probably have to look at a you know s Cath and I have to sit down and say , Look for every course , this needs to happen .
108908:60	And I 'll I 'll probably have to look at a you know s Cath and I have to sit down and say , Look for every course , this needs to happen .
108959:46	Well that 's why I say , I do n't think it has to always be , Sue ,
108979:47	Getting people to change their approach and expect that with training , expect to have to analyze what they what they thought they 're going to get out of it , why they should be doing it .
109001:44	So I think that 's something that we we 're going to have to .
109002:33	And it may well be that that we 'll have to you know make sure everybody who 's running a training course , gets this particular
109010:15	And er we all had to do an action plan at the end of the course , and then three months later
109023:17	I think that ha has to be in on if you 're on a slightly longer course than that a day you
109067:33	Obviously interpreted your er But I think we 'll have to work towards that and I I agree Sue I think there 's two ways either saying , you know , we don we do it for everything , or
109206:28	But then that would mean that you 'd have to have assessed people in whatever it was they were going on the training course before
109221:11	Although we have to pay for hi we have to pay for Adrian you see .
109221:33	Although we have to pay for hi we have to pay for Adrian you see .
109266:12	But then that has to be fed back to
109308:12	we 're gonna have to build up to it .
109359:11	That we have to develop at some stage .
109407:100	And they had a system where erm they got this information and they It was that they I think there there was something about the time element , it had to happen at a certain time
109475:7	It must be Well it must be it must have been done and er Alison 's in involved in that is n't she ?
109475:21	It must be Well it must be it must have been done and er Alison 's in involved in that is n't she ?
109475:32	It must be Well it must be it must have been done and er Alison 's in involved in that is n't she ?
109479:18	I 'm sure it must must have been .
109479:21	I 'm sure it must must have been .
109499:25	Anyway that is something we 'll have to develop I think for all all levels of of staff .
109803:9	do we have to use .
109804:9	Do you have to use somebody else 's ?
110464:14	Yes I I must say that .
110692:4	have to start doing that .
110944:9	And it has to be May ?
111059:18	So you 're gonna have to gonna start writing letters we 're gonna make sure we
111174:36	I think we are goi we are going to have to face the fact that we are not going to get an outing
111453:13	Anything else we have to do for the open day ?
111582:14	Well their mother 'll have to give them
112042:30	Fifty pounds for a pair of earrings , must be worth that in gold .
113136:14	Er and and you have to pick the ideas that you think can apply to to your application .
113177:28	Erm initially , initially very bad , I have to say that .
113183:22	Erm quite a lot you just have to be honest with people and tell I mean we 've got It 's unfortunate we can threaten people if you like , it 's the wrong word to use .
113190:36	Erm there had been one or two occasions where we have to be the management if you like , and say , No I 'm sorry , that is what we are doing .
113213:7	You have to remember that was on old coal mining area .
113251:9	And you have to adjust that policy at local level .
113279:28	And this is the m the message you have to get across to the people .
113564:38	I just wish it was all over , like now I had to last out until the thirty first of March , which I did do .
113567:88	But then again , when I was a a small boy the university professors that were interested in me told my father I 'd do what I would have to do in my mid-forties .
113605:7	I must get my other teeth attended to and the cream can deal with .
113730:7	I must say that street , er they were a little busy at the time with Newbury and Christchurch and who can blame but them that they were very successful .
113732:77	Erm well what we decided on the the procedure was that we 'd toss a coin , in front of you all , we must be democratic , and some Either of these two gentleman is going to say heads or tails , and whoever wins can choose either to go erm first or second .
113733:48	They have er thirty minutes each , er twenty minutes A at least ten minutes have to be given over to you for questions , so they speak for a maximum of twenty minutes .
113751:31	So we er we 'll time them so We must be terribly fair .
113760:189	Greater Manchester West is my first choice , not Greater Manchester East , and when I looked at the vote in the last contest , back in nineteen eighty eight , when the erm then Alliance , or the ex-Alliance vote was split between the social erm liberal democrats as they were then , and the S D P , and saw the votes I had to beat this time , six thousand nine hundred , I thought I can look good next to that .
113763:64	I think the first thing you 're going to need from any candidate is that they 're going to have to believe in Europe .
113769:30	I believe some of the things we have to share with the Europeans and learn from them are very urgent in Britain at the moment .
113779:8	We have to learn form them , we have to be in with them , we are Europeans , and that is our destiny .
113779:29	We have to learn form them , we have to be in with them , we are Europeans , and that is our destiny .
113781:35	We 're the one 's who unashamedly say , Europe has to go forward if it does n't go backwards .
113793:32	And as I say , we believe that we have to have a federal structure and we believe in m democracy throughout Europe and throughout Britain .
113798:92	It 's all very well believing in things , it 's all very well being on board for the ideas , but this campaign in greater Manchester West , and elsewhere , has got to achieve things .
113804:79	Because the present British government are so totally encompassing , they 're such a dead hand , they are doing so much damage that the Liberal Democrat 's have got to be seen as a party that can help beat them or indeed , entirely on its own beat them .
113808:32	They are in a lot of trouble and we have got to benefit from it .
113812:36	It may be a low turnout , but our voters do n't have to be part of a low turnout .
113827:24	And clearly anyone from outside Northwest Manchester has got to start looking at the are and doing some research and finding out where the big firms are , who the important people are , etcetera , to make sure that I know the area that I 'm candidate in .
113843:24	Because some of the time the candidate has to be some of the other things as well .
113845:12	But sometimes you have to do them yourself .
113846:33	And it 's good to know that if you have to , you can .
113847:56	And it 's good to know if you , when you know you 've got to have to build teams , that you 've done it before .
113876:33	And my own feeling about this is that we do have to move more to planned expansion .
113877:10	We do have to take a leaf , a little bit out of Kenzie 's book from the n the late nineteen thirties and afterwards , that when things are receding , you do n't batten down the hatches , you do n't simply close things in .
113878:19	The government has The governments have got to step in to create opportunities .
113893:9	Erm one has to say though that that does mean creating wealth .
113900:26	er has done a good job , one has to face it , in supporting the objectors to that motorway .
113926:48	Now my own view is is that this point in time we all do have to get together and agree .
113929:44	Erm that the time has now come to accept that we do have to do the same things and it has to be in black and white and it has to be E E C wide .
113929:67	Erm that the time has now come to accept that we do have to do the same things and it has to be in black and white and it has to be E E C wide .
113929:93	Erm that the time has now come to accept that we do have to do the same things and it has to be in black and white and it has to be E E C wide .
113930:166	Because , let 's face it , if we 're all one economy it is n't a level playing field if one country is inviting in erm companies er You know , transnationals , the lot , on the promise it 's cheaper to get our workers to work for you , you do n't have to pay out for this .
113956:60	So I would I would think we 've got to cautious , but the aspiration 's obviously , have got to be to increase the size .
113962:47	And and er obviously if you 're going to be European properly there has to be a full cooperation in many of the aspects of life How would you answer the these bogey this bogeyman tactic of loss of sovereignty , ?
113966:36	I think I think first of all it has to be pointed out that what the Maastricht treaty , or I would p perhaps would n't always use the word Maastricht , but what the present policies are trying to achieve is not just erm if you like , some loss of sovereignty , but some gaining of sovereignty and in subsidiarity more power for the reason in fact .
113981:18	So I think we have to push the idea of what is your alternative please ?
114054:7	We have to be more creative , perhaps in the er press releases we put out , not churn one out every single day , that would be nonsensical , but whatever we do churn out , as a press release , it 's got to be relevant , and they will find interesting .
114074:94	The issue , as far as I can see , and I was told , when I was growing it up in school , about the holocaust and that we must ensure that everybody remembers about the holocaust in Germany , and that it should never ever be allowed to happen again .
114079:42	But until such time as that political solution is arrived at , we have to ensure the protection of the people in that particular area of Europe .
114090:35	In terms of the other eastern bloc countries , what you have to say is what is the long terms aspiration and goal of the E C ?
114109:27	And I think it 's going to have to be the latter , we are going to have to decide , and the M twenty five enlargement is the critical debate at the moment .
114109:58	And I think it 's going to have to be the latter , we are going to have to decide , and the M twenty five enlargement is the critical debate at the moment .
114110:110	Are we going to go for fourteen lane high way , or motorway , on the M twenty five , cos if you do , all the roads that lead from it are going to have to be fourteen lane .
114112:8	We have to control it and those who nee or use the car , are going to have to pay the price of using that car .
114112:59	We have to control it and those who nee or use the car , are going to have to pay the price of using that car .
114162:36	I 've now got the job Oh i think you have to go out .
114178:108	Er can i just say er before erm I announce the result , I whispered to Frank there in announcing the result I did n't know I could n't pronounce his name so I has to check it .
114204:9	But i must say we 're now the great chance , one of the Great chances that we have next June , in my mind , is the Post Office will put the let er Our pamphlets through every letter box in eight constituencies ,
114205:24	Well I 'd think they 'd have to be good , they er er at Bolton at the General Election , they put Bolton Southeast through a lot of Bolton West and Northeast but
114224:62	It 's it 's part of the high profile that will er will You know you do n't have to walk .
114226:128	Er so thank you for coming and do n't forget the candidates and and Thank John personally for for for being such a very good er candidate in in this erm hustings , er but do n't leave the candidates to to You must fee The people in Salford and Eccles and in er Worsley , who get the Manchester Evening News , Er It 's it 's that they they put lo there 's local issues is n't there ?
114227:212	Y I mean local Manchester Evening News issues that they put out in they put out where where we live in Kearsley , there 's a lot of people in Kearsley buy the Manchester And er we 've got to feed the candidate with all these things so that it gets into the into the Your local newspaper , the local free paper goes out in every area , you must get the name in as from tomorrow .
114396:172	For truly , I say to you , if you have faith as a grain of mustard seed , you 'll say to this mountain , move from here to there , and it 'll move , and nothing 'll be impossible.And the way that the text is translated I 've always supposed that Jesus must have thought that mustard seeds had a lot of faith .
114397:25	Something that starts out so tiny must have a lot of faith to believe that it can become something big .
114452:9	So we must n't take ourselves too seriously in this .
114614:19	And so I suppose we must go back and we must say well is is Paul serious ?
114614:36	And so I suppose we must go back and we must say well is is Paul serious ?
114637:60	So if we are to think of all of this in terms of Christian joy then we must realize that joy does not come from being immune to everything else that 's going on .
114665:9	So we must take a text like this at face value .
114684:24	I 'm I 'm actually I have to go back to a house .
114732:49	Could you have a look at this little card , the first of many I have to say .
114936:12	Between Do I have to use this again ?
114950:7	They must mean , on stamps .
115175:7	He must have a c a collection of thousands thousands of records .
115231:7	You must have noticed our grass at the front on your way in then .
115238:15	Aye well mine must be .
115322:62	I 've still got plen Well er that will be two boys , a lady giver , cos you have to find people who give stamps as well .
115332:16	I says , I have to follow up leads .
115374:18	Aye I think they must it must be talking about dictating as well .
115374:25	Aye I think they must it must be talking about dictating as well .
115656:18	She 's got she must n't eat anything with preservatives .
115671:37	They 've got most most times I think you 'll have to be unemployed for six months .
115736:42	Erm but to get into the social work department she 'll still have to do the that that
115781:7	I had to quote .
115782:7	I had to look through all the rest and take what I wanted .
115787:10	Aye I had to look through the whole lot of them .
115804:56	I felt like saying , I 've got a bloody big pile of rubbish here that I have to go over so I 've put in for overtime .
115885:23	Right , quite right cos you have to work for two
115892:78	I said , Oh yes , and if you think for one minute I 'm taking pathology forms to your room , I said , you must have had .
116033:19	Not many houses in I must have passed his house when I was up there .
116052:85	Well I think I do n't think it 's all that It 's not a recent bungalow by the sounds of it cos he 's had to have new plumbing
116057:7	You must have put them in your bag .
116152:30	And I could only play nine holes and I had to
116168:9	And Sheila had to start giving me direction .
116214:9	The signal must travel better .
116231:12	And you really have to see them before and after .
116270:36	Now you 've got the chance to go you 'll have to get a decent sized boat now .
116348:57	And it would have been good because it was per The only thing was he would have had to have gone up to and do a survival course .
116710:33	Does it mean for his name sake , that you must confess his name ?
116762:77	Salvation in found in no one else for is there there is no other name under heaven given to me by which we must be seen .
117031:19	God come He Christ must come first .
117490:9	So he must have been in
117676:9	and we must n't do that .
117798:7	He must have been .
118139:12	You no longer have to .
118281:12	And I 've had to believe in the power of the subconscious as well as my own responsibilities ,
118393:7	I must leave now , do n't stop now , please carry on .
118445:27	We can say we 're going to have to keep you off for a bit longer yet .
118465:10	We 'll have to we 'll have to
118465:24	We 'll have to we 'll have to
118623:15	Er we have n't had to see anybody about that and he sent us a letter saying that he 'd like to see us and we went and he says it there might not be a second inquest .
118647:40	And that 's a These are the preliminary things that the solicitor must go through before they get near court , so
118655:13	we may well have to provide the medical report on your behalf , yet .
118687:43	dates and they ca n't say what 's going to happens they have to go through , sift the evidence , arrange it all in a certain order ,
118692:26	And er they thought Thursday they 'd have to do an operation on her by taking a piece of bone from her hip ,
118701:17	Well they 'll probably have to put at least the bone in there , it 's a bone graft .
118750:6	not have to bother
118756:71	But then he mentioned , when we wen to see him , he says we will deal with this but you must get somebody for civil
118899:9	Will he have to go on the
118900:22	Yes he will , he 'll have to go on the plug yeah he c You 're not fit for work for a little while .
118946:48	Now you ca n't actually park by casualty 's door , you 're going to have to park a little bit before that .
119010:12	right , I must admit , I 'm inclined the same way .
119071:7	it must be in my dreams or
119170:9	So I had to get out of bed and turn over .
119171:38	But I still i ca n't lie on it , I still have to go back cos of that leg you see ?
119541:63	But I 'll I 'll make enquiries , and if it looks like she has gone out I will have to get in and we I 'm sure we can twist an arm .
119746:21	Well I mean er we have to take notice of you do n't we ?
119808:72	Ah it 's the acne it 's I ran out two weeks ago , so we 've been on holiday I had to get those prescription .
119934:32	Yes when you go up there you 'll have to register but if you I mean I presume the university term 's what ten weeks ?
119946:17	I think some one has to walk from Nottingham to Dundee .
119952:44	There 's absolutely nothing to tell your doctor fortunately , so we do n't have to do a summary for you or anything like that .
120333:10	You 'll have to count up .
120402:22	sounds less like hay fever I must say .
120658:20	So that 's what we have to check from time to time .
120784:10	It 'll have to be back dated after Christmas .
120825:21	are quite good actually , it must be said .
120932:15	Well it it must be three times four is equal
121105:53	There might be times when we let you do the whole lot or when you have to have more than one go at it .
121335:20	Which is why you must do that sort of That that 's probably all you need for that bit .
121397:10	You 'd have to do what we did on the other page .
121398:10	You 'd have to do this .
121471:60	And then I came down to Kerry after my operations because I was er for my feet , I had to get them amputated because For the hardening of the arteries
121483:45	And then of course at er the time of the lambing time you had to go out and help with the lambing time , you know , to help the shepherds with If he 'd a weakling lamb you 'd always to bring it in the house and then feed it in a bottle .
121485:59	And keep it warm and then er if you had er Then you had the chickens to you had to set the clucking hens and and bring out as many chickens as you could .
121486:59	And then after , in the winter , and then after that when it was near hay time , I had to go out and help with the hay .
121487:60	That was gathering it in and if they were putting it into little into tramp coles I had to get up and tramp hay round and round the boss and er I did that .
121504:9	And I had to help with the harvest too .
121555:54	And it was er They used to great pride in their in their er stacks because they had to make them as neat as they could and er well built , so that if the So that w that was good for the To keep the the wind keep them dry .
121561:63	Then there was always the harvest home dance , and then the school , that was the only place we had to dance in that day and they had it decorated with various kinds of the the the c corn dollies and erm
121611:12	So father had to get the men up from Blair Gowrie , there was six of them that came .
121616:32	It was a busier time for us because we had to feed the the the six of them w we put them into a big shed and they just slept there but we we gave them their dinner , they managed to make their own breakfast and their tea whatever They had bread and stuff like that but we had to make their dinner for them .
121616:189	It was a busier time for us because we had to feed the the the six of them w we put them into a big shed and they just slept there but we we gave them their dinner , they managed to make their own breakfast and their tea whatever They had bread and stuff like that but we had to make their dinner for them .
121728:7	You had to get up in the morning and see that there was plenty of a great pot of of hot water , boiling water .
121737:54	But then next day after the s pig was killed up it was The the head had to be cut into sections and well cleaned and left overnight in the salt water and To clean any bloody parts on it .
121752:171	There was cleaks there was er cleaks in er in Most of the kitchens had rafters , a lot of them , and there was cleaks just specially for the hanging the pigs and the er the hams of the And then you left them until they were fairly dry , and then you had to cover them well and truly with a for all summer , because the fly would go for them , if the were n't properly salted and dry .
121814:7	They had to see that they were provided with milk and butter and eggs and er venison and the rabbits and things for their food .
121964:25	You know he was that tramp must have been an honest man because father said there was quite a little of sovereigns in that , and so I suppose it had been given to the parish and had seen that the man was properly buried , and then they discovered that he was an Aberdonian .
121989:41	but he he would never stay except , you know , it always had to be in respectable kind of a barn or something he would live in , least And in fact instead of that he would ra if it was good days he would rather lie at the dyke side .
122133:7	You had to do that .
122198:9	And they had to have their secret routes , you see the excise men would be looking for them .
122309:7	They had to be done like that and yeuk and then throw the neep in there and then the next day so that when the
122317:7	You had to lay them this way and that way
122403:24	And you did that and then you had to wait until the the machine came round again and that was you again , you 'd a whole day at that .
122409:47	Oh just a good arm full , a good arm full of a sheaf you would have to put down .
122435:17	And then you would n't have to go round the fields doing the sheaves ?
122462:37	Just just a And you 'd to set them right We had to set them that they 've stayed like that .
122477:82	And if it was n't , My goodness it was a job when it come wet weather and it maybe be lying flat and it all had to be set up , and we had stooks for days .
122493:20	And maybe next day you would have to turn them again t to dry .
122522:21	It was built er It has to be It had to be very well built and firm , because then , when it was used for the cow for the er sheep , usually , that best hay was left for the sheep .
122522:34	It was built er It has to be It had to be very well built and firm , because then , when it was used for the cow for the er sheep , usually , that best hay was left for the sheep .
122607:34	Mother had a lot of good words too , I must say , but er it was him we learnt a lot of wor And granny especially you learned a lot of words of hers .
122725:138	So it did n't necessarily mean that you get a squad of riveters that would stayed together all the time , erm for various reasons , as I say they may have been , unfortunately some of them might even die and therefore you had to make up the squad again
122731:53	I do n't suppose it would be thinking about it now , because they would probably have to join the queue like everybody else , would that be right ?
122763:57	You were on piece work you got paid by the rivet sort of thing , so you had to go ahead with it .
122769:75	Was it easier for them was it easy for them to pick up work or would they have been woul would they have to face a long time on the dole or ?
122772:27	In fact er on many occasions they would have to move out of town to get a job .
122797:177	Er I never actually had any part in it but I heard tales about er the rivet boy in particular , the they would er they would give him a wage equivalent to what they thought was was a was a reasonable wage for him , because of the fact that they were on piece work , he had to see that the rivets there on time .
122812:27	dare say quite a lot of it must have been spent in pubs as well .
122820:22	Or or was it did you have to be out of school ?
122856:125	But there again er it was the time we lived in and you had certain Well yards had their own way of trying to keep track of when a guy was in a toilet etcetera and sometimes you would have to hand in y your er your time ticket , to the toilet attendant , and you would give him this ticket and he would say right you are , you know , and mark down your number on a book and say to you , well you 've got seven minutes or something you know .
122857:9	So you had to be sharp .
122916:12	No well it had to be a fair share out .
122927:12	see you had to go out and look through the rivet hole to see who was shouting in you know .
122944:45	Some of them could n't afford i You had I think you had to put something in .
122945:15	I think you had to kind of build up
122946:15	You mu You had to have so much in the Co
122966:23	You could lay You did n't have to pay that black book every week .
122977:10	But you had to have it paid every quarter .
122983:30	If the Co was up on the Tuesday you had to have it paid for the Saturday , at least .
122987:7	It had to be paid before the Tuesday
122994:51	If you If you paid it The Co was up on the Tuesday , you had to have it paid Most people tried to pay it for the Thursday and that was the turn of the leaf , on the Thursday and if you paid that then you could go straight away that day and get your new quarter stuff , for the next quarter .
123008:26	Sometimes the people that owned the book had to pay it for them you know .
123044:9	But they had to take on the worry of people that could n't pay them .
123066:8	what have to pay that they would probably have dividend and they would pay that for you and you would have to pay them back .
123066:69	what have to pay that they would probably have dividend and they would pay that for you and you would have to pay them back .
123084:18	Oh no you would still have to pay that .
123100:56	But the first week of the quarter you could get messages all that week which you did n't have to pay till the end of the quarter .
123103:30	but that first weeks messages you did n't have to pay them till the end of the quarter , which meant that people went in and bought things that week , they never bought you know ?
123108:86	That was a great week because they felt they were getting it for nothing , till it come to the end of the quarter and then they had to pay it .
123110:20	So to get this You had to pay this , because when it came to the end of the quarter , you had to get your shopping out of that Cooperative , so that had to be paid .
123110:72	So to get this You had to pay this , because when it came to the end of the quarter , you had to get your shopping out of that Cooperative , so that had to be paid .
123110:107	So to get this You had to pay this , because when it came to the end of the quarter , you had to get your shopping out of that Cooperative , so that had to be paid .
123111:42	Otherwise you would n't get any more Co er Cooperative messages , so you had to pay that .
123124:14	and you did n't have to deal with money .
123127:19	The the coal man did n't have to deal with money because I think some of them was dipping into their bags you know .
123177:14	Oh Aye you had to Some people would have went mad with getting them
123180:7	You had to watch but if people came to your door in a in a state that er you knew it was a genuine case , you would probably help them out you know .
123181:11	And did you have to did you have to actually When you went to the shop , say to buy some messages , or to buy whatever erm in the drapery or whatever ,
123181:24	And did you have to did you have to actually When you went to the shop , say to buy some messages , or to buy whatever erm in the drapery or whatever ,
123183:9	did you have to actually present the book , when you went
123191:28	Oh no they did n't allow that you had to have the book .
123206:7	That must have been a one off .
123208:7	You had to have your book .
123219:9	But you had to take all that worry that
123286:17	You know , it had to be ready cash for all these shops , the probably did their bit when people had money , you know if you had a wee bit extra money .
123312:63	which was made up of local towns people , you know , and and er I mean you did n't have to be a a notary in the town to be on this er Co board th th You know you could be one of the riveters you were talking about earlier .
123378:50	The bath , you had a bath room with a bath on the wall but you had to heat the water on a at the kitchen the kitchen fire .
123380:33	The boiler did n't fill automatic , you had you had to fill it with water .
123401:53	You know a gas er light in the hall but the less The stairway , you either had to go up by er with a candle in your hand , you see ?
123519:58	When I had spare time , but if you 'd If it was decent weather you 'd have to give a hand in the garden at home you see ?
123520:7	You had to help get the garden Keep the garden tidy , keep the weeds down .
123523:11	So I had to give me father a hand , you know , to keep the garden , and he had plenty to do .
123606:11	And you had to do all that dusting and keep it and you 'd read over all these things , every time you dusted until you got to know them .
123632:17	What extra did you have to do for humans ?
123633:41	Well you were always One thing you were very careful , you had to see that the gall bladder was removed .
123644:22	Are they The chemist then would have to buy in all the bottles .
123651:28	When you got the bottles did they have to be cleaned ?
123751:29	And did you find that the text book they had to use , changed through the years or just the
123838:34	s three public houses there in a , a row , must be fairly unique that .
123870:34	Just get rid of them and I wo wo n't have to worry about them any more .
123881:33	Er I think you 've all guessed that I must be the policeman .
124058:30	If you do n't want them you do n't have to but they 're free of charge .
124066:44	If , if there 's an incident happens , does n't mean you have to wait for the local police officer to tell , to come along and tell him , you 've still got police support all round you anywhere .
124104:10	Well it must have been , to arrive Tuesdays .
124218:8	I had to go round the other night , Saturday night , and you could n't get through the door .
124244:37	Well I , I , I 'll , what I 'll have to do is have a word with the local police on this , cos it 's not something I can deal with tonight .
124357:24	The o one thing that w we have to have in mind though is that the this particular criminal that we are does n't want to get caught .
124535:28	Now the choices , I mean you 'll have to look at , think about your house and so you can , is , is my house easily seen from the road or not ?
124565:15	You do n't actually have to know there 's a caravan , it 's quite obvious when you 've had one move it away .
124850:14	Er because you have to switch them on and off and all this business .
124863:93	People had gone up to a house and been knocking on the door waiting for someone to come because the light had come on and they thought there must be somebody in because they switched the light on when they saw me come up the drive , and these are visitors .
124885:32	Is the top , I mean I broke , had to get in my own house when I locked myself out once when I 'd been in the garden and I , I just got in by leaning through the top window and opening the bottom window , so now I always lock the bottom windows , I do n't bother locking the top one I open it
124889:42	So that if even if they reach through they 're going to have to break the lock just to get in .
124911:25	before I realized that all you had to do was put your hand through my letter box , reach up and you could take , open the Yale lock because I 'd been there a year I locked myself out and I thought the only thing I can do is try and get in by putting my hand through .
124927:38	Well I could n't get in my house cos I 'd have to undo
124972:12	If someone has to break a window and knock out all the glass it makes even more noise .
125088:10	Er it has to be a small group .
125371:17	Sometimes er do I have to take them all the time ?
125443:8	You have to get another one , you see .
125496:11	and then we have to reassess you and say you 're medically
125693:26	but you know , walking I 've had to stop twice .
125800:35	I , I have got it on the prescription I had to get it Doctor sent me to the hospital ,
125890:11	I just have to wait for his letter , but I think the sensible thing to do would be to talk to you about what he 's putting you on because a lot of these drugs are not without potential side effects .
125906:7	I must admit I 've been taking
125984:27	I think , I think we have to wait for the letter , I suspect you 'll probably find both those changed to some extent after that so er I think we really have to wait for that .
125984:111	I think , I think we have to wait for the letter , I suspect you 'll probably find both those changed to some extent after that so er I think we really have to wait for that .
126038:19	we 'll , we 'll have to see .
126050:54	That 's right , because you had sugar in your wee and we thought we really must have a look at what we 've got , your fasting blood sugar was absolutely fine , so that looks normal .
126061:10	we may have to do what 's called a glucose tolerance test .
126202:57	But it will improve , and the important thing is , pain relief if necessary , because you must keep your shoulder moving .
126227:9	But we must have another sample , and we we
126448:24	blood s yes i you 'll have to see one of either Doctor or Doctor I 'm afraid but er if I , if I write everything down they 'll know exactly where we are and what 's going on .
126562:9	And it must be taken on an empty stomach .
126589:7	You must be down somewhere near your target weight I should think .
126699:64	that I 'm w now , so what I suggest we do , is before we say we must make your premenstrual tension better with various manip various bits and bobs , and there are quite a few things we can do to help .
126722:12	You , you must be round your ideal weight really .
126805:15	And you may actually have to use Betnovate on a preventative basis every now and again .
127109:62	It implies there 's something more to it , more to it than just a standard bug I must say .
127216:4	have to confess .
127233:84	Well we 'll , we 'll see what happens with the Eyecron I think that 'll turn it off , but does n't then we must have another look , very
127252:23	er one thing or another , I must have spent a couple of thousand pounds on these photos .
127317:136	Erm because although they accept that there are certain conditions within the , within the tower block which affect the block as a whole , they would say that they would affect each individual flat to a greater or lesser degree and that they would have to be taken on individual merit .
127442:48	Because you 're not , because you 're inside a lot , you do n't have to go out every day , you do n't , you do n't have anything very specific to do at different times during the day .
127583:132	Right , carrying on erm for the subject of erm compensation over and above erm that which is normally given to people who move from one place to another when , when they 're , they 're f h h have to be ,
127603:13	So you 'd have to ask him ,
127612:18	Th well then we 'd have to we 'd have to present it .
127612:32	Th well then we 'd have to we 'd have to present it .
127617:35	Well , it 'd be , it mi it might have to , it mi it might have to go , go
127684:50	Yeah , in the flats themselves , living in the flats , I mean s have to look at the actual local facilities as well , I mean they 're , I mean I suppose that 's a factor as well to take into account ?
127778:28	Y I do n't know , you 'd have to ask them .
127786:10	That would have to , that would have to come out of any kind of interview with workers in those other groups really .
127786:27	That would have to , that would have to come out of any kind of interview with workers in those other groups really .
128038:104	I do n't know , people l I 'm of them say they ca n't afford to pay the kids , and get the food for the kids , and they 'll have to give them chips a couple of , every day of the week or whatever , but th there 's no need for that .
128116:11	That I must technically pay for it .
128203:137	Well I do n't know how true it is but I have heard from somebody I know , whose husband was a a plumber , and he came to unplug a toilet at the erm Cricket Players when it closed down , he had to unplug it .
128205:32	And he said from the looks of it there must have been you know sort of dead , whatever it was , and there was a couple of fingers and a couple of toes , right ?
128211:11	Well I had to , I had to wait for about eight months or was it s six months to get one of my lights fixed but for er other things they were quite quick actually .
128211:23	Well I had to , I had to wait for about eight months or was it s six months to get one of my lights fixed but for er other things they were quite quick actually .
128267:42	So that 's the nature of the world to day , you have to move with the times , it 's going to be a but er this is how we survive .
128381:9	So he had to go to Queen Elizabeth , the court , to ask for a charter .
128408:41	So you know , these traditions die hard but I m but things had to change and they changed really after the Second World War .
128416:7	Someone had to respond to this demand , the small little shop in the village could n't do it , even the big Co-ops could n't do it .
128420:7	We have to produce dozens , hundreds of dozens , thousand of dozens of this product that the ladies wanted .
128424:13	Dr so we had to respond to that , and we responded in a number of ways .
128441:22	And the acrylics because the acrylic yarns had to be developed , new yarns had to be developed apart from machinery we had to develop yarns that would meet the demand .
128441:42	And the acrylics because the acrylic yarns had to be developed , new yarns had to be developed apart from machinery we had to develop yarns that would meet the demand .
128441:67	And the acrylics because the acrylic yarns had to be developed , new yarns had to be developed apart from machinery we had to develop yarns that would meet the demand .
128443:7	Something had to be produced so the acrylics were produced in .
128465:18	Jackline in the , you have to do something with the comb when it 's not showing so you 've , what 's happened to the white ?
128583:28	the important thing in the last two years , everything has to be in , as I say it 's not true to say everything but quite a lot of things have been in , so both those are , are the .
128645:101	Now we 've got multiply into the brackets , so we 'll just leave the ten where it is and work out what happens to this , everything inside the bracket has got to be multiplied by ?
128689:52	Twenty add three , put the brackets round it show that 's one number we have to work out what that is first .
128913:97	And then adding all these up , well there 's none of them that add up that we can just add in to any of the others , so we 'll have to leave them all like that , so the answer is just a , a thousand , plus a hundred Y plus ten X , plus X Y. Now if we wanted to multiply , let 's say we want to multiply a hundred and three by seventeen , that just means that X is seven , sorry X is three and Y is seven .
129157:24	What do we do , you must take away everything that 's in the brackets , so we take away a twenty , so that 's the same as a minus twenty and then we 'll take away a minus one , signs are the same so it 's add one .
129188:58	So it does seem to work this method , and it wor this is the method we have to use for all the numbers including the As and Bs and Xs and Ys where we do n't know what the number is .
129273:22	How would you , if you had to do that if you do it the easy way , do n't do it the hard way , how would you do that ?
129522:10	Anyway I must dash because I 've got
129560:9	So I have to work out what the entire value of these is .
129619:11	going to have to start from somewhere , so
129677:12	You do n't have to remember all of them , cos if you remember one you just need a little bit of maths to work out the others .
129742:37	Two forty a hundred and twenty plus V times it by oh have to divide it by , so it would be er watts over voltage is er
129770:4	must be the other way round , cos that 's not right .
129788:68	Erm I do n't think I have got any written down here for you to have a look so I 'll have to write it down for you erm stuff about Stanley knives .
129819:23	when you find out , you must try and think of some way that y can make you to think of it .
129925:36	More current going through , changed the voltage , so it must mean the resistance has gone down .
130419:17	d you do n't have to be that specific , you 'd , really you 'd want to know is it erm
130434:29	Draw a diagram with , it does n't have to be neat just sort of scrawl all over it and tat it until you get it to
130526:33	So your diagram will get very messy , it does n't have to all fit together , as long as you can get all the main points of what 's happening .
130580:30	And Newton 's third law says , that your hand must be pushing up on it .
130750:9	So there must be a frictional force here , pulling the bottom of the ladder in .
130752:37	It 's trying to slide down the wall , so there must be something pulling it up the wall , frictional force
130801:111	Erm to be honest the revision getting a bit neglected it 's , we 've done most of our coursework , in most subjects there 's coursework which in some subjects which has to be , not , does n't have to be done before the exam but it 's preparation , preparation work for the exams .
130801:133	Erm to be honest the revision getting a bit neglected it 's , we 've done most of our coursework , in most subjects there 's coursework which in some subjects which has to be , not , does n't have to be done before the exam but it 's preparation , preparation work for the exams .
130805:17	C D T you have to do four sheets which you take into the exam .
130844:81	Erm I would , I think it would be very useful if you could make time in the next day or so , you do n't have to spend long on this you know , if you just spent sort of
130850:86	And then wherever you 've got rid of conductance think well they have n't given me that , they 've given me resistance , oh I had to write one over resistance turning it into conductance .
131469:10	Oh he must have been .
131473:19	He says , I 'll have to let Professor know .
131480:43	And er he says er he says , you know I 'll have to get somewhere to stay , is there anywhere where I could stay ?
131592:10	Oh you have to back the ro the way you come .
131871:24	I says , I doubt he must be lying around somewhere .
132012:49	There was no , all these highfalutin er certificates to gain en all you had to , had to gain to be fit for employment then was a qualifying certificate , that was the only certificate issued in those days .
132012:58	There was no , all these highfalutin er certificates to gain en all you had to , had to gain to be fit for employment then was a qualifying certificate , that was the only certificate issued in those days .
132026:119	And we had the pit ponies and where we did n't have the pit ponies drawing the hutches , which we termed the small wagons carrying the coal from the coal face to the pit bottom , then er we had to do it by hand .
132039:45	And in those days we required the money and er often , very often we had to do it to strengthen our wages a bit .
132049:7	We had to pay into a union .
132159:9	All we had to do was sign our name to it .
132188:45	Which you had , the government , the government or building firms had to guarantee you forty four hours ' payment f of wages , forty four hours guaranteed and you had to get that whether you were working or not .
132188:98	Which you had , the government , the government or building firms had to guarantee you forty four hours ' payment f of wages , forty four hours guaranteed and you had to get that whether you were working or not .
132190:21	That m er the firms must guarantee forty four hours wages for the man , does n't matter what
132208:50	But once you were qualified for the job you could n't put a stranger on you had to ta teach that stranger a job .
132222:16	Because the conductor always had to wait until such time as the queue was diminished quite a bit and hi his tramcar was full so that the next tramcar come along er coming along , whatever number , was to be d the same thing happening again .
132229:45	Now why ca n't they issue a ticket , transferable ticket So I do n't have to use three buses , all I have to do is I 've got one ticket , now that ticket reserved for particular .
132229:72	Now why ca n't they issue a ticket , transferable ticket So I do n't have to use three buses , all I have to do is I 've got one ticket , now that ticket reserved for particular .
132254:17	And er did you have to work like erm shifts and things like that ?
132329:11	Although you had to be very careful in er in d knowing what to go after .
132406:57	And , and then er at that particular time you know and er then unemployment you , I you had to see each firm was issued with the and the firms had to agree that you had to sign a contract of employment so that er if you were leaving or he was paying you off , you had to be given two weeks ' notice either way before they pay you off .
132406:93	And , and then er at that particular time you know and er then unemployment you , I you had to see each firm was issued with the and the firms had to agree that you had to sign a contract of employment so that er if you were leaving or he was paying you off , you had to be given two weeks ' notice either way before they pay you off .
132406:110	And , and then er at that particular time you know and er then unemployment you , I you had to see each firm was issued with the and the firms had to agree that you had to sign a contract of employment so that er if you were leaving or he was paying you off , you had to be given two weeks ' notice either way before they pay you off .
132406:177	And , and then er at that particular time you know and er then unemployment you , I you had to see each firm was issued with the and the firms had to agree that you had to sign a contract of employment so that er if you were leaving or he was paying you off , you had to be given two weeks ' notice either way before they pay you off .
132418:9	And we had to go down through fourteen feet of solid rock .
132434:78	That was an essential b eventually that was taken away , but the building trade still believed if a building firm wanted men , they had to have at least a thirty two hour guarantee , which is at present still in operation .
132435:18	A thirty t they had to guarantee an employee thirty two hour guarantee ,
132444:49	So to stop all that , this is with the b building trade , they had to guarantee them .
132479:60	Ah but I believed if I 'm going to discuss or argue about anything as regarding that I had to be interested in it .
132481:41	Whether it be a union branch meeting or any other branch meeting you had to be there and you had to know what you 're talking about .
132481:60	Whether it be a union branch meeting or any other branch meeting you had to be there and you had to know what you 're talking about .
132514:49	Now if you use that , that g gives the people the wrong impression that you must be a pensioner before you can join it , but this is not so .
132637:22	And when I took , I had to report back to area control I was immediate I got immediate applause .
132707:39	Well lads , he says , I 'm sorry you 'll have to wait another hour .
132844:50	However er during the course of our er dialogues with the management , er and I must say this that er they did introduce er whenever asked , new equipment , new tools , they did everything possible to make life a bit easier for our members er in that respect .
132855:94	But er at that time there was plenty work coming in , erm there was , there was no need for us to be apprehensive , and so therefore we had to convince the management that in the best interests of everybody , having agreed that the scheme would go on across the whole spectrum of the workforce , was to move reasonably , you know , quickly through the various machine departments and introduce with a minimum amount of frustration .
132856:9	And we had to keep pushing them all along .
132863:19	I would , I would have to be absolutely honest and that and er I would n't exclude myself from that particular er way of thinking because when they moved in , when you got a time for a job , erm for example there was one particular job that I was on erm and I thought that I was doing it reasonable accurately and rapidly , erm and they wanted to introduce a new fixture so that you know , I could do the whole series of faces on it .
132904:9	But it must have changed the , the
132910:134	One , in order that the old type of arrangement you know , would no longer prevail , and that subsequently if people were going to have assemblies , part assemblies before they assembled the whole unit , then whole areas would have to be cleared , new benches would have to be built , the departments would have to be totally gone through you know , and all the rubbish cleared out and , and access and egress you know , to every department to make life easier for everybody .
132910:157	One , in order that the old type of arrangement you know , would no longer prevail , and that subsequently if people were going to have assemblies , part assemblies before they assembled the whole unit , then whole areas would have to be cleared , new benches would have to be built , the departments would have to be totally gone through you know , and all the rubbish cleared out and , and access and egress you know , to every department to make life easier for everybody .

132944:36	The , for example , where I worked I had to bale out you know in the morning about thirty pails of water , you know before I could even see my footboard .
132961:44	Er and the result was that the heavy casting you know , did n't have to travel the system had to be monitored correctly , you had to see that fair play er was the order of the day both in respect of the member and indeed the management to try and reach a er an agreement .
132961:61	Er and the result was that the heavy casting you know , did n't have to travel the system had to be monitored correctly , you had to see that fair play er was the order of the day both in respect of the member and indeed the management to try and reach a er an agreement .
132961:84	Er and the result was that the heavy casting you know , did n't have to travel the system had to be monitored correctly , you had to see that fair play er was the order of the day both in respect of the member and indeed the management to try and reach a er an agreement .
132962:41	Er but in order to introduce reasonable facilities for shop stewards , we had to make approaches to the management over a period of time .
132964:35	Er and we shared the common objective that these minutes would have to be scrutinized purposefully because if there was any element er in any of the minutes that we did n't disagree with , then we would point it out to the management and had a redraft and have a signed redraft er by the secretary and the convenor , which meant that er at least we were all talking with a common voice .
132968:13	And er that had to be regulated , regulated as far as fairness and response to er any claim that our members may make in respect of fairness you know , er and it , to enable them to reach the target bonus .
132971:30	There was a whole host of things that had to be monitored by the stewards er on a daily basis .
132977:97	Well er in the early days , erm there were occasions where erm if I may say so , that , that just to divert for a moment , the scheme had to have supervision , and there was an increase in the staff , the number of foremen and chargehands increased .
132978:16	Primarily because the foremen had to regulate their own department as far as er input and output was concerned .
132979:7	They had to regulate the er flow of materials , from the store to the individuals concerned .
132980:90	Erm and it became too much for them because people were working more efficient , and therefore there was a an increase in the productivity level , and so they had to increase the number of foremen and chargehands , which was n't a bad thing because it was always our members that got made up to these respective er positions .
133055:37	I think that er one of the things that we had to examine at national level er and this was done erm after I became a full time officer , erm there 'd usually be a procedure in the national agreement er whereby first of all if we registered failure to agree at domestic level , erm with the management , the next stage was to draw in the district secretary .
133060:43	If you eventually failed to agree at that level , then you would have to register failure to agree as you did in all other cases you know , leading up to that stage .
133076:22	And therefore in the interim period things had to be you know , you had to treat people fairly in order not to let them be of the belief er that going to er central conference was just an exercise .
133076:47	And therefore in the interim period things had to be you know , you had to treat people fairly in order not to let them be of the belief er that going to er central conference was just an exercise .
133114:56	Now what was required then was that although the job was in a rush , the management had to telephone down to the Admiralty in Bath to get the appropriate sanction you know , to , to accept the cylinder with the er bigger gauge bore .
133169:63	It was a peculiar street because Street was on a higher level and at one time , the dam which must have been open , now the dam when I mention the dam , it 's the mill lead , but known to everybody in Galashiels as the dam .
133209:75	And an ideal little workshop for anybody doing work as they did in the early days , most of the components of a motor car had to made .
133238:19	Er he , the family , must have came at a later date into Galashiels .
133243:17	They belonged and they had to come back to .
133255:79	And er this bicycle well it would go out of fashion and was put in a , a loft in one of the , it must have changed hands from Mr whom it was made for .
133264:87	But when I looked at the date , my father could only have been about twelve year old you see , when these letters were written so it must have been my grandfather writing to Coventry and Birmingham for parts for the penny farthing bicycles which he worked on .
133268:19	And erm these er he must have given up bicycles when the penny farthing was outdated .
133301:17	But anyway we , they must have been so impressed by the , the order that they got , that they gave us the agency for Galashiels and Selkirk for the Austin .
133319:58	Which I really I went to Amos and I did n't like it but of course I had to stick it .
133337:8	We had to go from the School to the School for two years and back to the School again , and er finally we 'd go to the Academy .
133360:58	Yes , I have the slip somewhere , and my father I did n't keep it but my father must have kept it , but I discovered it one day and it was seven and thruppence I think for the first week 's pay .
133369:10	Er there must have been a at one time it , it had been six o' clock I think it was a quarter to six we finished .
133382:7	You had to put them all on in a piece you see with the tube in it and er things became much easier when the wheel base trim came in .
133385:34	And er they were kept in a special store which had to be three feet into the ground you know , for safety .
133389:15	And of course you had to have great dustsheets to keep the dust .
133391:15	Or or you would have to take the whole thing off again .
133395:7	They had to be done in a special , you know where they extracted the , the fumes away from the , the paint shop .
133421:104	Now orders came from the , and also we had orders for th , e the falling target in the you know , of a , a rifle range where you had to er put up the frames you know with a target on it and er we made a lot of these during the First World War .
133432:74	Then he landed in Oxford just at the right time to go out to the factory and it was open , and you had to get your car as soon as you could and see that everything was all right .
133434:53	And then he , he got on the road and he , we usually took , he had to run it er not more than twenty five miles and hour , and er you had to run it , we , we stopped at Preston if we could get there .
133434:99	And then he , he got on the road and he , we usually took , he had to run it er not more than twenty five miles and hour , and er you had to run it , we , we stopped at Preston if we could get there .
133465:18	Er and of course they had to use these crocodiles er down the coast er where the Germans were holding out er at and Dunkirk you see .
133487:56	Now er we , I came back here then and of course we had , the , the workshop had to be brought back to normal again to deal with the cars .
133517:60	And er then we after the war was finished , we continued making them for several years , but we had to transfer it to another factory .
133521:30	And we got a firm in Glasgow who had to move .
133528:54	And er until it became the time when the thing got smaller and smaller and we finally had to do away with that place .
133549:27	Because I changed out there , but we had to pay about five pounds just to change from one line to the other .
133606:20	However he , he must of chosen the right place to go and er he went right up onto the hill and Mr got his shooting er and he bought the thing on the spot .
133651:37	And er I thought it was , what a money it must have cost to put that one commercial firm doing that .
133694:16	Now the duties I had to do there was to take the place of what the Provost of the town did before you see .
133707:29	Erm what sort of duties did you have to deal with in that ?
133722:36	We would have liked to rebuild it but then we had to find places for the people to go and being a narrow valley it , most of the housing was put at the end of the town .
133725:61	And er there was a stage when we came to the , where we really decided we 'd have to earmark different streets , how far we were gonna go in the centre of the town , because people were beginning to get grants for altering houses , and then in another five years time the council , the council were having to buy back these houses to redevelop the area .
133742:23	And er it was er we had to develop it from a poorhouse into an old folks ' home .
133760:54	Not without throwing a great lot onto the rates because the rates were just Selkirkshire , and Peebleshire had to keep it up then and er we did n't er get grants for it in these days .
133982:59	So as that stands , just take the square root of X , not a function , and you 'll have to restrict it .
134055:18	What , what you have to say here , for this one , right , we restrict X to say X is less than the of zero .
134137:7	He must have ran out with my copy before , cos this is different .
134212:13	they do n't have to understand it , they just have to remember the words , yeah .
134212:36	they do n't have to understand it , they just have to remember the words , yeah .
134248:13	They do n't have to be numbers , they can be people , trees , names whatever you like .
134357:75	Where you have got a function because you can manipulate them so much , and turn them around , and I thought , there must be points along functions , where it is , it goes against the rules ,
134426:9	So you have to be careful of zero .
134489:88	And whether it 's electronics or physics or maths or anything else , erm when you get to the point where you 're dividing by zero , you have to say well now we leave the , the mathematical model , and we just go back to the common sense model .
134683:69	if it 's a many-one , watch out , cos you 're going to need , what you 're going to have to do if you need the inverse function at any time ,
134697:7	What must I have given you ?
134698:34	Well if it 's something plus three , then you must have given me two .
134704:27	Well if it 's plus three , you must have minus three .
134710:12	Erm we have to restrict the input , I 'd have to restrict the input to three .
134710:38	Erm we have to restrict the input , I 'd have to restrict the input to three .
134785:47	So we say , oh well , we can do it , but we 'll have to invent another sort of number .
134789:14	extras that we have to bring in .
134837:36	You , you get used to the idea that all squares must be positive , so a negative number ca n't have a square root .
134863:10	You just have to put the indexes up with the letters to say what you 're going to do to it .
134952:12	So you 'd have to restrict that a lot .
134962:21	If you 're going to have to find the inverse , you 're going to need to restrict it .
135108:13	Well you 'd have to restrict it .
135157:34	No but I mean , it 's something that had to be dealt with , aside junior school and everything else that 's applications getting made elsewhere .
135230:40	Because come somebody saying , and just giving me them , I had to go through them all .
135249:21	At some time , you 'll have to come back into some sort of a system like G C S Es if , if they 're , I mean they might be changed , but there 'll be something like
135250:46	He 's only aged eleven , he 's only got four years before he has to have something assessed anyway .
135274:12	Erm you have to put them into use erm twelve to start with .
135326:66	the ones who are , who have seen it all before , and done it from last year , because they had to split a smaller section of them up into the first year .
135585:12	Right so you have to expand it .
135735:77	Well I , I worked in Johnny Walkers , and when I worked in there at that time when you get married you had to leave , that was their policy ,
135738:9	So I had to go to the , like the job centre and they offered me this , which I did n't really fancy at the time .
135828:56	I think there 's about seventy or women in it , but there used to be must have been about , maybe about eighty or ninety women
135864:12	But er we have to repair everybody else 's bad work .
135875:157	And er the spoolers think they 're better than us , cos they get higher pay than us , they think it 's er they 're more skilled , it takes them to longer to train to do the job seemingly but they could n't , we have to sort their repairs again if they do anything wrong it 's us that have
135883:74	And the , the , the laugh I had was er , the last time they were advertising for spoolers they , you had to have I think it was O levels or something ,
135896:41	I was n't interested in , I liked anything you did n't have to use your brain for .
135953:7	You have to face people er that sometimes not very pleased that you 're coming ,
136016:7	I must admit in the break I we like to do the crossword .
136048:101	And then well I met John , when I was in there , started going out with him , and er as I say when you get married in there you had to leave , so this , this was the next job they offered me .
136129:58	jobs , maybe a good eye to pick up faults in the pattern and that but as for you have to be clever I think it 's senseless .
136132:9	Do you have to stand all day ?
136233:10	Oh it must be thirtyish .
136236:12	Aye , she must be .
136266:15	Oh right so you have to travel in ?
136543:245	But it 's lasted about seven year , so you never can organ but once we did start I did enjoy the ones over here because over there when your kids were small you did n't go out much anyway but now that your kids are up you 've got it , and personally I enjoyed the ones that started but they do n't have Christmas dance , barn dances and things like this , they do n't org we have to have to organize like that ourself .
136543:252	But it 's lasted about seven year , so you never can organ but once we did start I did enjoy the ones over here because over there when your kids were small you did n't go out much anyway but now that your kids are up you 've got it , and personally I enjoyed the ones that started but they do n't have Christmas dance , barn dances and things like this , they do n't org we have to have to organize like that ourself .
136593:10	But you have to work damned hard to , all year round to get
136618:55	I 've got to do that twice a day which I did n't know we actually had to do when I started it .
136648:83	I mean we 're not allowed as many holidays as , as most of them , but then again it was starting up so we just had to take it that way .
136688:24	he bought a flat do he had to go where he was getting , aye , more money , and then again as I say if he was ill he would get his pay for so long .
136692:7	You have to weigh up the pros and cons .
136701:20	that we used to have to make our own and I 'm not kidding you , and was ne was a you know ?
136800:7	she must be fed up going up and down to Glasgow .
136803:15	But no , she must do it while she 's young
136861:9	So now have to go for the contracting , the overseas jobs .
136930:13	Oh just everybody has to pull together , mhm .
137047:82	I mean I , I , I do n't drink a lot , I mean maybe after I 've been out in the hills you have got to drink something to replace the sweat , but I 'm not a great drinker and I do n't , I do n't smoke and I , I do n't like discos or anything like that
137118:48	but because er you maybe had a degree well you get in there and you have to start
137143:39	But saying that if you want a decent wage in here you have to work a lot of overtime .
137234:4	have to start some .
137371:37	Oh it 's just a fact now you 've just have to go and do as you 're told .
137501:12	Oh aye , had to be because I mean you do n't stay young forever ,
137743:10	Oh you must have some nicknames for the bosses .
137744:8	There must have been nicknames but er ca n't really , do n't really remember .
137769:52	Maybe in the , in the , outlying districts maybe , but I think they 'll have to travel to go to work .
137905:8	it has to go , go to John tonight .
137922:27	So again for reasons like that , we have to maintain the confidence of the client .
137947:23	That 's something that we do have to work on and I ca n't emphasize it too strongly .
138008:7	We have to change the definition of the word that we 've grown up with over the years , otherwise we really ca n't manage the concept .
138012:14	But what we have to do is completely junk the definition of the word quality that we 've grown up with over the years .
138070:46	But if we are going to meet expectations of clients then really we have to know exactly what it is the client needs and would be happy with .
138071:9	And we have to specify internally to us what will meet the client needs and even just exceed the client needs .
138072:20	And that is what we have to do within the time and organization constraints which Norman er correctly mentioned earlier .
138098:15	W what we have to do with quality management , is introduce the horses for courses idea .
138101:47	We , we do have , you do have some small cheap jobs which have to be attended to very efficiently .
138121:9	So we have to accept that a car that might be fit for the purpose of shopping in , in , in a town where the parking places are small and the multistorey car parks are difficult to drive round , er er a quality car might be a Mini .
138158:117	I 'm sorry , I 'm sorry I 've been a bit steady getting there , but I think it 's an important issue to tackle that , quality is horses for courses and we have to accept the fact that we 're gonna get prestige type jobs and quick slick jobs , especially in the beginning of March every year .
138248:31	There are other problems as well that we 'd have to tackle .
138265:7	We must write down the objectives of this exercise .
138266:7	We must plan what we are going to do .
138323:7	Management have to take responsibility for over ninety five percent of the problems we get , whether they 're safety problems , quality problems or whatever problems .
138438:20	As a service organization , we must continually meet the needs and expectations of our clients and in the most economic way .
138439:22	To meet these aspirations we must make the best use of our human , technological , material and financial resources and this must be done within the framework of a well planned and a well managed system .
138439:64	To meet these aspirations we must make the best use of our human , technological , material and financial resources and this must be done within the framework of a well planned and a well managed system .
138499:7	You have to remember that all work assigned within the group is organized as projects and as a service organization no two of our projects are identical .
138540:31	Lun lunch time is fixed for twelve so we must get .
138585:17	Now , what we have to do is organize for ourselves a mechanism whereby , for any particular project , we use the procedures that are necessary for that project .
138616:88	Both for not being prepared , not giving the opening of this course the importance that it did deserve , and obviously for the embarrassment that er you must have felt having to sit there while I made a total fool of myself .
138655:10	You might have to find your own chair actually .
138797:30	Well we did because we said we 'd have to specify what to .
138861:55	That 'll be , we , we sort of weighed up from the length of what we had to show
138907:7	That must be DOPACS units .
138919:15	I think they must be .
139088:88	Er we left that out because of Dennis ' assurance that it was just our costs , but these are , this is certainly something that we would have to er add to our cost .
139166:62	Erm and , and and , and probably those points are erm of interest and some of them er will have to be taken into account .
139173:70	Erm t just to er well there was a l a certain lack of time on this thing , I mean , Dennis had to come round and tell us to start our tick-list else we were n't gonna .
139174:97	Er and if he 'd of walked up to John two minutes later he probably would n't have made it because we had a right erm but we did feel there had to be some initials .
139207:15	But er it would have to be a client discussion , about when he actually wanted the contract completing .
139269:14	Erm the key dates have to be here as well as on the D Five , cos this forms part of the appointment contract to the client .
139274:18	I think what you have to remember is that these three sheets er are in fact , well w what we have to remember is that the business manager is an internal client , and that these three sheets are something to him , or to her , to type to form the appointment contract , so therefore let 's get it right .
139274:74	I think what you have to remember is that these three sheets er are in fact , well w what we have to remember is that the business manager is an internal client , and that these three sheets are something to him , or to her , to type to form the appointment contract , so therefore let 's get it right .
139308:13	It does n't have to be checked by someone else , it does n't have to be an independent check , unless the regulations demand it .
139308:44	It does n't have to be checked by someone else , it does n't have to be an independent check , unless the regulations demand it .
139435:13	And we actually had to comply with certain clauses a a and provide method statements and
139495:74	I would actually like to emphasize that the qu quality plan is originally intended to help the people who are going to have to do the job at the coal face .
139509:75	It 's a living system , it 's designed to help you , if it 's not supporting and helping you then it must be changed .
139511:117	I will add a cautionary comment however , and say that you wo n't necessarily be able to change absolutely everything , at any time of the day or night , because there are some base requirements we have to address and we have to meet .
139511:133	I will add a cautionary comment however , and say that you wo n't necessarily be able to change absolutely everything , at any time of the day or night , because there are some base requirements we have to address and we have to meet .
139512:84	Those base requirements are enshrined within I S O Nine Thousand and One , and if that says , thou shalt do X and Y and Z , then we have to do X and Y and Z .
139521:41	But nevertheless it does contain one or two quite hard requirements which we have to meet if we 're going to obtain and retain the certificate .
139631:25	From , young , I think he must be about eleven , saying , I 'm concerned about safety crossing the road at Westgate , because cars and lorries go very fast along there .
139667:26	Can I just enquire why er we had to state getting the fourteen thousand
139771:8	I have to say , relatively er in an erm unbiased as unbiased as they could be .
139804:16	I think they have to , this is why we have to get in at the beginning , and be , be part of the structure .
139804:39	I think they have to , this is why we have to get in at the beginning , and be , be part of the structure .
139841:217	I think that 's the one danger of all of this , is that both the County Council 's and the District Council 's aim perhaps or now are beginning to listen to the parish councils , but also , just really get an eye off the ball , cos they 're looking for the increased responsibilities for their own purposes , and I think that 's one serious danger that we c have to face , as a local community .
139870:13	It does n't have to be someone from this parish council , maybe other people are interested , or prepared to attend .
139921:10	it would have to rise up onto this , this path .
139944:12	The rest would have to be done in phases .
139992:54	Yes , but , the the main part of this as I understand the drawing , you 'll have to ask Mr when he comes , but the main part of , of the square , which would n't be the third which is done in the first phase according to the phase that they 're currently proposing .
140013:100	No , these did n't show any stalls , but they 're i it was explained that one of the constraints in the design of the scheme was the brief that they had to leave space for er as many stalls as possible to be erected .
140080:7	I must be honest , having seen the children leap off that bridge , it 's not going to be long before somebody falls and hurts themselves .
140090:10	You 'd have to fence right along the bridge and completely block it .
140111:45	And I think if you 're going to open it up , you must consider probably a wicker gate or something s so that a child cannot run onto Road .
140136:10	We 've had to increase the cost of that estimate by , for three things .
140153:22	It 's a problem that we had to face , and we had to take it , because otherwise we were going to be faced with an enormous bill , erm for ourselves , because it was down to us .
140153:39	It 's a problem that we had to face , and we had to take it , because otherwise we were going to be faced with an enormous bill , erm for ourselves , because it was down to us .
140181:47	We budgeted a thousand pounds , it looks as if we 're going to have to spend more on urgent work .
140183:20	So we 're going to have to proceed with some of this expenditure , probably twice the budgeted b budgeted erm monies .
140201:52	when th they 're in a public park , as these are I think public safety has to take priority over the wildlife consideration .
140214:47	I think that you 've made the point that those who are concerned must go and , and speak to the clerk and look at the er specifications
140273:74	I think in order to support our our response to the Royal Commission , which is imminent , the County Council and the District Council must now have had firm ideas on what they intend to do with parishes .
140306:17	I feel that we must take it almost immediately , because if those bricks do go , we 're going to have a major .
140412:131	He does n't think that widening the carriageway on the corner of Road and Road will be very sensible , but that was n't what we were suggesting , we were suggesting I think on er Avenue rather than so we 'll have to write back and tell him .
140437:20	Shall I , I shall have to apologize to the council , cos I mean I did do the , the survey of the erm residents and of course I had flu last month , I do apologize , I did n't actually manage to get that done .
140500:46	Chairman , if they ask for er er additional rent , all we have to say is no , you maintain it as a , as a recreation ground , erm you know and then it passes back to them .
140516:37	It sticks in my throat that you know we 've had to pay it but , from the point of view of the residents , we 've done the right thing by letting it .
140572:50	So we 'll , we 'll come back to that issue later , because we 'll have to approve whether we rent the land i in future years anyway , it does come up .
140586:189	So er can I suggest that we actually ask the the Recreation Ground Committee to look at these problems over the er I do n't think there are any significant problems actually after the , after the Easter weekend fortunately , but just to have er in reply to the city football club , because they are concerned , and have been I have to say for many years , so it 's not unusual .
140636:20	That is why specialist units have to be shut down .
140644:41	I , come on I mean , if El Presidente Michael Heseltine , has to go all the way to Venice to have a heart attack .
140646:9	And he has to go abroad before he dare have a heart attack .
140776:88	So all the rhetoric that we 've had from this government about better performance N H S , more people being seen by the N H S , that must be read against the fact that over a million people are , or a million patients , are er waiting on N H S waiting lists .
140804:7	We must fight to defend it .
140805:7	We must resolve on the forty fifth anniversary to continue in our support .
140806:7	We must all of us write to the Health Authority , to our local M Ps , to the government to defend Orthopaedic Hospital .
140816:7	I had to bring my passport with me to er obviously get into coming from but er I 've got a letter from Alan as well so er me over the border .
140990:7	You must 've had people passing through there , famous people who you can register , get them there , do , do this sort of thing .
141104:17	I 'm going to have to ap apologize er to all the speakers on the platform , who 've actually got prior commitments er pretty soon after the speeches I 'll just let Mick speak and then I 'm gonna have to close the meeting .
141104:126	I 'm going to have to ap apologize er to all the speakers on the platform , who 've actually got prior commitments er pretty soon after the speeches I 'll just let Mick speak and then I 'm gonna have to close the meeting .
141136:41	Er I 'd be fourteen in the June and we used to have to keep on till the end of the term which was August .
141296:51	Now he , he had about he about seven or eight kids I think , he must have done , yeah .
141319:31	Well I started at fourteen and I , I had to leave er when I was fifteen and , no , nearly sixteen .
141350:95	My mother went down the yard and seen the boss and asked him if he could get and the fact that my mother went down the yard I suppose er he must have felt sorry for us .
141386:79	He come at me and he was six foot two and he come he were gonna knock hell out of me so I had to protect myself and we got fighting in the shop .
141444:47	Cos they , they er Walter used to say , any positive voters we must get them out on the day .
141544:12	Oh well there must have been .
141558:21	Yeah , but did n't you have to go there to get your dole ?
141680:74	I 've seen th this fella came down and he was selling pianos and er he went down this particular terrace and he must have sold seven , eight , or nine or ten on , on both sides .
141730:56	He said , , he got the strap out of the desk , about three or four , you must know what a strap is do n't you ?
141764:115	You , you get a tin er and whoever 's sort of looking after the tin , er somebody kicks it , one 'll kick the tin and then you all go and hide , and he has to find you before you can come back and kick the tin .
141768:78	Well we used to play that in the street you see , have the lampposts , the top of the yard and there , there and have to set a good target rounders .
141838:10	So we had to go to pictures and we had to have a few or whatever .
141838:33	So we had to go to pictures and we had to have a few or whatever .
141871:37	Er if , if you , if you had , you had to dig a little hole in , in the , in the , by the wall on the , on the pavement like that to hold about sixty four marbles say , and you 'd start off and say , give or give or take give or take as a lawyer , I used to have four marbles , and whoever was taken that was a lawyer of four marbles , I do n't know why .
141909:7	I had to go to court , to pay five bob , cos I were riding a bike without a light .
142081:9	Did you have to help around the house when you were a child ?
142093:89	When we were about nine and ten and a half we had somebody living in because there were an awful lot of evening meetings that my father had to go to and usually mother went with him .
142175:30	She 'd ge nothing everything she did she had to sort of beautify it and put some embroidery on it .
142213:32	We did have lines , hundred lines , I must do not do this or something like that which was very negative really .
142315:8	You have to clean a lot of brasses , but I mean I was n't gonna be put off .
142329:41	Th this type of thing until the , after the three months we had to pass an exam .
142340:65	And I and I do n't know whether they still have the wooden lockers now but they used to be , have to be all scrubbed out every week .
142349:31	You either got tuck boxes from home or you had to supplement it with your own earnings , which , ten shillings a week .
142351:18	And out of that you had to keep yourself in stockings , er and shoes for the ward .
142361:9	But you had to be in by eight o' clock .
142401:50	And there was a satisfaction about it although I always think in those days we had to work so fast that there was n't the time to do what you 'd really like to have done for the patients .
142402:80	It was a case of , I mean we used to start and wash them at three o' clock in the morning because t you had to start then because you 'd never get it all done .
142403:7	You had to get everything done by the day staff coming on at seven .
142406:14	But you just had to do that sort of thing , I , we used to feel awfully sorry for the patients but you had , they had do it because they would n't have got a wash otherwise , there was so mu so much to do .
142419:9	Did you have to have any particular qualifications when you started ?
142447:31	We did n't have time off for lectures we had to fit them in with our wi with our off duty .
142448:53	Er and often you 'd come off duty at eight o' clock a and you 'd have to go to a lecture between eight and nine at night .
142449:88	And , and even if you were on night duty you 'd be on night duty for twelve hours , you 'd come off at eight in the morning and have to go to a lecture at nine .
142454:16	But we used to have to take notes during the lecture a and then write the lectures up afterwards .
142460:86	And if you were on night duty you 'd get two nights off , but when you came back you 'd , you 'd , you 'd have to be on duty that night so you 'd have to go to bed that day .
142460:118	And if you were on night duty you 'd get two nights off , but when you came back you 'd , you 'd , you 'd have to be on duty that night so you 'd have to go to bed that day .
142465:65	I think they 've all got their own washing machines on the ward and that sort of thing , whereas we had to do it by hand and then bundle it all up and send it down to the laundry .
142476:7	We had to keep our hair right under our caps , look ver very much the nurse .
142479:56	We were not allowed to have any ladders in our stockings or anything like that , we had to look very smart .
142480:46	Er and always always clean and in those , even when you were , you had to behave yourself when you were not on duty when you were , even if you , she saw you out not looking er smart she 'd soon tell you about it , er , no you let the hospital down when you , you 're like that .
142481:45	And we were never allowed to go out in uniform , we always had to change er into mufti .
142482:64	But er n no , she was , she was , she was very particular even on the wards everything had to be just so .
142487:24	And er all , all magazines and papers had to be put away .
142491:34	Or if any , the locker was n't straight , everything had to be very , very straight , very , very correct .
142514:17	And even then er you had to ask for permission to stay out till ten .
142515:47	You , you were n't auto sort of automatically allowed out till ten you had to go to the office and say , please may I stay out till ten .
142522:21	Er that you , you had to have your sleep otherwise you were , you were n't er you , you could n't a attend to your lectures and , and do your work the next day .
142523:16	You had , you had to get your night 's sleep and proper rest .
142525:163	Well I suppose probably people li like nursemaids and er and er what they used to call in those days mothers ' helps , who used to sort of be a general skivvy around the house and would look after the children , and , and , and they were the same , they had to be in I think at , at sort of ten o' clock at night .
142549:41	and then if you 'd been off sick at all you had to make that time up as well so it was about four years and six months I did there altogether .
142565:76	Yes , y yes , you , you were , you 'd sort of passed all your exams so yo th they sort of had to make it a little bit easier .
142566:50	You , you were allowed to , to stay out but erm you , you had to get permission .
142567:50	You were n't sort of allowed just in and out when you wanted to , you had to get permission to stay out late .
142583:62	Er and you 'd er they 'd er just bang on the door and , and call you and you had to be downstairs in five minutes .
142589:64	It 'd mean waiting till , often till the , the father came back from work and then he 'd have to er sometimes come right up to the er to the nursing home er to tell you that , that they was , that she was in labour and would we please come .
142610:15	And so you 'd have to go and find this bowl and sterilize it again .
142611:17	But you , you just had to fit in with things .
142616:18	So they , they just had to try and save er from the , the man 's wages and if , and , and if they were n't in work there was very very little money at all .
142630:105	Yes , they were appointed by the County Council so I sup and er I , I rather think that they , we never got paid but I rather think th they 'd have to pay the Council something for the midwife 's services .
142634:7	We had to pay for our own training in those days .
142636:64	The County Council er w would train you but you 'd do your erm year 's training and then you had to work for them for a year , I think it was a year or eighteen months .
142709:10	They 'd have to .
142712:41	Erm no , they 'd usually give an anaesthetic if the mother had to be sewn or if it was a forceps delivery , but that was all .
142724:12	And you just had to make do best way you could .
142772:38	Well all you really could do was say , well you 'll have to ask your doctor and get him to have a talk with your husband .
142809:18	Er but usually you 'd have to give perhaps a drink of erm er water just , just warm water .
142811:12	You , you had to in those days you had to sort of er use your common sense because if you had a big healthy baby it 's a long while to go right through ten o' clock at night till six o' clock the next morning .
142811:34	You , you had to in those days you had to sort of er use your common sense because if you had a big healthy baby it 's a long while to go right through ten o' clock at night till six o' clock the next morning .
142891:71	We , all of us had er a bed-sitting room of our own which we kept on between cases cos we had to have somewhere to live and erm and then of course we , we 'd come back there and make up for lost time really .
142904:65	They were , which was , well it was quite useful really because er you , you know you had to be , you were called out to a case suddenly er there was always somebody just to make sure you had n't left any food you know in the kitchen that was going to grow whiskers until you got back .
142930:17	But er ther there 'd have to be a good reason for it if , if , if erm the nurses did go out , er afterwards .
142934:72	The husband had either died or something of that sort , or the husband was unable to work , then the mother would have to work to keep things going .
143003:40	Er and then when the Second World War started er we , we had to leave there and come down to the er sh to the sh shop really .
143008:34	But erm when I lost my sight then he had to close that down and come back so we were all under one roof again .
143010:21	Where was it that you had to move from during the War ?
143011:32	Well it , it I expected that he would have to go and I should have to manage on my own and it was quite er er a , a way to come down to the shop .
143011:50	Well it , it I expected that he would have to go and I should have to manage on my own and it was quite er er a , a way to come down to the shop .
143019:30	Erm he , I think what he really must have had was er a sort of mild form of polio when he was young and he 'd got a shoulder , not completely paralysed but it was partially paralysed .
143050:31	Er and I always used to think it must be extremely , they 'd hear them going out at night and you know then count the planes coming back .
143060:60	They , they we they had some guns on the castle and they were , I suppose there must have been enemy planes over .
143288:19	I feel as if I have to use my spray more .
143290:12	You should n't have to use your spray more Mary because that 's
143308:15	And this I 've had to take it twice while I 've been doing some shopping now .
143661:12	The wee man must have asked for it .
143683:33	Do n't know why because it just means he has to take
144073:15	I think I must have picked up a virus .
144125:55	this morning what I 'd done this morning was just dancing about cos I , I had to go to the toilet I could n't wait
144237:20	I hope I do n't have to call you out then .
144448:17	So they said I had to come in and get it syringed .
144638:57	This is one that 's been , I 've had appointment and for three times I 'd had to cancel it .
144710:26	Here we are then and they 'll have to get that sorted for .
144767:12	reason I had to get it
145893:12	Anything else I have to ?
146150:7	just have to keep on .
146407:9	So I must have passed it on .
146410:32	In fact it 's , it 's really You have to be living in the same house as somebody who 's
146474:34	most of this is drying up but the skull must get It seems to
146744:62	I 'm not sure how happy we will be able to that but we do n't , we obviously have to try .
146883:11	This person 's had to three and a half weeks .
146972:58	once you include that it , because the more he 's out of the office the more Sheila has to cover for him .
146999:61	Erm Ray 's raised another point , it 's about for example the further education network links that he has to service , the five N Y B E C groups he has to service , erm collating work experience on the database .
146999:95	Erm Ray 's raised another point , it 's about for example the further education network links that he has to service , the five N Y B E C groups he has to service , erm collating work experience on the database .
147071:39	There 's a lot more work to get it , we 'll have to decide what
147111:12	I 'm gonna have to look at how that can be done .
147145:11	because people have to come in on meetings so these people h
147255:9	So I must check that the figures I 've already given you , that 's the way that I 've done it .
147262:107	I mean I do n't mind which institutional type you call it because it 's not so much the courses , it 's the numbers of people and the numbers of places you have to service
147268:18	Divide er yeah , I must check that out .
147433:35	That 's a debate area that 's going to have to come to , yeah .
147537:14	Well we 'll have to , to , but we 've got C S M T the next day anyway .
147592:10	Mm I must admit I 'm , I 'm interes be interesting to see the outcome , you know when audit commission and O F S T E D say that thirty percent of people who enter further and higher education fail .
147624:15	The problem , we must make sure Ray does n't include the amount of time he nee extra he needs to arrive at every meeting half an hour early .
147707:68	H I mean I 'm really talking about the high number of post sixteen special needs people Gail has , has to see that I mean they probably exist in other
147718:96	Well I , I think to t we could try and make an assessment of the case load , special needs post sixteen case load in ter and we 'd have to do it in terms of the work we actually do .
147727:67	If they 're saying they work with people that are post sixteen and a special need , then they 'll have to identify those people and have to say , but th the
147727:85	If they 're saying they work with people that are post sixteen and a special need , then they 'll have to identify those people and have to say , but th the
147764:37	that people feel are an issue cos together we have to exclude it .
147789:55	I mean I think at the end of the day because we 're w going to have to basically in a sense your job I think even though at the moment you 're saying you know fine I 'm not gonna exclude anything , I think it 's actually going to be sort of , to try and eliminate most of this .
147809:47	Erm and if you and Ray make the same case , then you and Ray have to fight for the
147816:37	then either we ignore it or we , well we 'd have to ignore it would n't
147840:84	I mean it 's interesting I mean Cynthia raised that point yesterday , to which the answer , I mean I 'm afraid I have to say th th the glib answer is , why are you telling me you need a minimum number of two members of staff at lunch time , for a full time office in the centre of town , surrounded by bloody phone calls , in school buildings , when you send one single member of staff aged twenty one ,
147913:9	but which have to come with numerical evidence .
147919:26	erm then we would actually go , have to go away from that meeting on the nineteenth and c and come back with that information
147954:9	And we had to do it over a week and over a month because some weeks you do things that do n't do
147983:22	Yeah well we had , we had to abandon that , we brou we brought all our Employment Officers in on a Friday , erm and we just could n't staff the office the rest of the week you see
147985:28	It 's gone by the board and I have to confess we 've not had a
147993:24	I , I 'm going to have to have more than one meeting and let people , say you 've got to come to one or the other and have them at different times during the week .
148015:4	has got to be taken off at some other time erm
148066:27	the way Val talks I think I must have been at something else .
148132:39	And er we were quite fortunate in this cos I went , had to go to a meeting in Sheffield and I had n't realized in advance but at this meeting the people at the meeting were asked to give recommendations as to what priorities should be given in terms of awarding the bids .
148151:10	So I had to come back and sort of say to Ray , you know , if we go for that bid it 's not likely to be supported , erm so we , what we 'd done is a different bid which still includes investors but it 's , it 's a bit broader than that .
148190:159	So you know , nothing might come of that but if it does erm I would be very keen to actually er the , the plan was to second a member of C S M T for six months to do it , and I would be very keen to do it I must admit .
148191:17	Erm but we 'll have to wait and see .
148292:19	and what M S U had to say when they reviewed us
148397:7	We have to go into Easingwold .
148437:53	Cynthia also admitted that maybe if they really had got staffing problems they would actually have to look at whether they , they did keep maintaining the , the sub offices that they were .
148459:20	But you see you still have to have a person there while we 're
148547:14	Erm but I must say that I know the view of erm both Ray and Cynthia is that they have a lack of management time in relation to the other two divisions , because they do n't have the assistant divisional manager post .
148564:20	So that what we will have to do is make our recommendations to Paul the following day .
148565:13	So we 'd have to go through it the next day anyway .
148573:10	You 'll have to be play it very carefully on the er on the Thursday and not look as if you , yeah
148645:24	has the time in that division has to put in
148716:24	Well it makes sense cos it must be Jackie 's .
148929:62	So we 're in ninety three ninety four we 've got about a year and a bit before we actually have to start really doing something
148941:9	So it must be the year more before .
149000:16	Mm , so you have to really be careful with
149045:44	Yes it did it run down to the river and we used to have to write to to get a permit to camp on there for the week but then there used to be an old , the old foreman of he used to come round every Saturday night , have you got your permit ?
149046:20	If you had n't you had to clear off and that 's when we used to make a tent out of anything , old sacks , bits of tarpaulin , anything then it 's covered over with erm .
149087:22	What sort of thing did you have to do wrong to get the cane ?
149175:122	Now my father was earning five pounds seven and six , twelve and six a week so there was a big difference in money were n't there and then you see be that list when they finished dredging he had to drop right back two pounds thirteen a week .
149177:13	Why did you have to knock them clear ?
149182:132	round the barrel about three times round the barrel then right down into the chain locker but if you kept , let it ride what we used to call let it ride well well now it get so big then you have to run it all off cos you had one lever , that 's what you had and the steam valve could have all steamed .
149197:9	So you had to
149219:19	So as a cabin boy you had to relieve
149220:7	I had to relieve , relieve the other deck hands for their meals and I started cleaning their cabin out as well .
149223:9	And you had to clean
149224:10	And I had to clean them and I had to get a bucket of water and sluice it down with a hard broom and .
149224:29	And I had to clean them and I had to get a bucket of water and sluice it down with a hard broom and .
149254:38	Oh it is a lot easier cos that all they have to do is run on , drop ' em come off again .
149255:47	Going back to your life as cabin boy , what other duties did you have to perform ?
149259:12	So you actually had to go on to a smaller boat ?
149271:42	The docker docker mission would n't supply you with water boots we had to supply our own , now today they supply them with everything even underlinen I think nearly now .
149321:9	Did you have to wear any other sort of special clothing ?
149331:239	Well that was , that was the crew 's job you see cos you used to have , they used to be erm , they used to be the master of the ship , my father , and they would still have a mate , he 's dead and gone and there was myself one side on the starboard side on a winch and we had two men right aft on the after winch and they used to have to look after three chains .
149333:11	Because you had to have the stern anchor to keep the buckets off the face of what you was dredging cos if you did n't your dredge 'd go ahead too much and er you had big problems there and you would n't be able to dredge .
149348:80	Well no , that 's to , we had two what they call , two dumb hoppers the Roxanne and the Sandbank and those dumb hoppers had to be towed to sea and t take
149366:88	Well cos th the government had allowed them so much I suppose and erm that was costing them so much on wages and that , so they had to cut them down on wages .
149382:15	What else did you have to do on the dredger ?
149389:37	How would you get them into the boat , because they must have been heavy ?
149393:9	Did you have to wait for it to be done ?
149427:46	That 's right and put your paddle in that and you scull you had to come down every time and many a time people 'd learn that that paddle will come out , but once you got the knack of it you could do it one hand , cos you was cutting down all the time like that 's what it was .
149436:31	On the dredger what other jobs would you have to do in the way of maintenance , you said you had to repair the buckets .
149436:68	On the dredger what other jobs would you have to do in the way of maintenance , you said you had to repair the buckets .
149437:42	Buckets , well every night time , when we finished dredging , you had to wash down , wash the decks down cos I mean that the decks used to be covered in mud and slush , so all we had then was an old draw bucket on a bit of rope , over the side , there were n't no hoses then , we used to the bucket and then we used to swing all the mud back in there , in the river .
149468:102	That was half full of water and the ice had cut through the wood flow down the river , cos the water was coming in like hell and er cos one thing I had to do about it , had like a chain in the , in th in the boat , so we pulled the chain out , I pulled the chain out first and go just got the , the erm hull just above water so I bail the boat out with a bucket chuck it down the side right quick .
149485:9	Well we had to keep somebody on watch in case there was any damage , say the ship was up the river and a chain broke or they hit you , so you had to put your navigation lights up and to put navigation lights up we had hurricane lamps , we had a red and a white one , they should have been six foot apart , they never were they was about three foot .
149485:105	Well we had to keep somebody on watch in case there was any damage , say the ship was up the river and a chain broke or they hit you , so you had to put your navigation lights up and to put navigation lights up we had hurricane lamps , we had a red and a white one , they should have been six foot apart , they never were they was about three foot .
149487:167	Well , that 's the quickest way to do it , we used to hang one below the other on the dredger , be put up at sunset and we used to take ' em down early in the morning , but you always had , you always had erm navigation lights up , must
149489:41	That was part of your job as a watchman , you have to all the little paraffin lamps , that 's all they were , sometimes they 'd keep alight and sometimes they would n't , they 'd go out but there was there was never much erm work at night times on the river , might be an old barge .
149645:95	Yeah , what we call a new cut , we dredge right opposite the Harbourmaster 's office and we dredged all and we used to do that tide time , had to work at ti tides , when it 's high tide , cos that otherwise there were n't any water there at all .
149648:140	Yeah , well they got they were , they were sharp both ends , they were n't , ai n't got no stern , them paddle they were paddle boats , so there you got one they had a rudder each end so they had to keep one rudder shut and the other one used to steer .
149683:75	Cos if you g if anybody go down there now they could see where what we call the Pier Head , so ships had to go up there and turn in to the lock gate .
149684:71	Now , the lock gates are right , the river , so they can come up straight in , previous they used to have to go up , up the river there , new cut and then turn into the dock .
149688:9	Did you have to do any dredging up there ?
149695:7	They must have been renewed somewhere about the erm I would say roughly round about nineteen twenty seven , twenty eight and that 's been renewed as lock gates , cos they took ' em out and they had a big crane come from Rotterdam to lift them up and er things do now well that 's surprising what they do do now .
149712:43	Used to dredge the channel out , how , how wide did the channel have to be ?
149721:9	So it must have taken a long while ?
149724:12	what they have to do , have to go further off now , when they are dredging now they have to go further off into the sea , North Sea
149724:24	what they have to do , have to go further off now , when they are dredging now they have to go further off into the sea , North Sea
149724:67	what they have to do , have to go further off now , when they are dredging now they have to go further off into the sea , North Sea
149735:152	And we 'd dredge ' em up and they and they used to pick ' em up on a bucket , go in there , pick ' em on a bucket and of course instead of them going over , the tumbler , into the harbour , we used to have to put a chain round and ' em off , cos if not they 'd have gone over them , tumbler and damaged the chute .
149772:137	Whether he come from this or not , but erm we were dredging the West Bank cos er the kind of ship we got there then were the big tankers and there were n't enough room for them to swing round , so we had to dredge part of the bank out to make the swinging berth and erm there we dredged a bone up about that size
149848:73	Well the first crane I drove was a was only at that so I was stuck on one of them and I had to sling me grab all the time and this , this bridge come round and miss the bridge and go over it and rush it down to the hold .
149876:104	Trouble yeah , trouble I got put off for a fortnight , on the dole , then he , I was on the dole for a week and er he cos at that time you had to appear in front of the erm , what they call the Court of Referees at the Labour Exchange , that was their Committee .
149877:8	You had to appear in front of them , well this , I 'd been off for a week and the old Harbourmaster old he sent for me and he said erm , you can start work tomorrow as I .
149882:30	Oh goodness , yes for the damage and you had to go in front of the Harbourmaster .
149886:97	That 's punishment , yeah , they would either do that or there was one driver down there he broke a wheel , that were n't his fault , and he had to pay for it , he had to go in the office like I did once .
149886:120	That 's punishment , yeah , they would either do that or there was one driver down there he broke a wheel , that were n't his fault , and he had to pay for it , he had to go in the office like I did once .
149887:8	I had to go in the office every Friday night and I was only earning about two pounds seventeen and six a week and they use and Deputy Harbourmaster , Captain , he say , how much you earned this week he say , three pound , I 'm asking you four he say , well they 'd take it off you and er you 'd be paying it now , takes about six months , and he old Harbourmaster see you about the quay he said .
149904:100	and there be twenty eight shillings a week , that 's all I allowed him and because that was even better than labour money and so the day , they , I had to keep that they stopped all me labour , so cos I had the money you see .
149980:81	If a docker , you got to help the dockers down the hold , if you ai n't got the crane driving to do , you had to go in the warehouse if there ai n't nothing to do .
149982:12	And you actually had to maintain your own
149983:9	And we had to maintain our own crane .
149992:58	Well you , you got on the cranes down there , you go up fifty feet and then you had to go up another fifty feet to your top of your jib .
150002:45	Otherwise what they got some of the latest cranes out down there , you had to come off the barrel , go up the jib , come down again , then up again .
150016:57	Well after you discharged the ship cos all the blood was there and erm they used to have to wash them holds all out then and this bacon was put on open lorries and taken to London , put in the refrigerator .
150040:17	What other cargoes would you have to unload as a crane driver ?
150049:22	Now stevedore , what did you have to do as a stevedore ?
150057:18	Instead of having they had to come through the Dock Commission all of the men , they wanted so and so men for that boat , they used to come through to me .
150067:18	That 's right they had to go on a rota .
150070:102	See the dockers then all got together and they said right so many men for that job , so many for that job and that did n't matter who they were , they had to their job , all the way round the dock .
150072:49	Whether they want to go or not , they take their turn and the employer had to pay a percentage into the pool what those men earned , so when those men had n't work at all they drew their money from the National Dock Labour Board .
150125:11	So they all have to be quite adaptable
150138:176	you u u use your brain a bit more , see now if er they used to come to me , my brother was one , he 'd come to me and he 'd say , right I 've got a heavy lift , so will you come up here and sling it for me but we had to put the slings round the heavy lift , say , I say right I 'll come up and another time we had a railway carriage come down like that 'll be shipped abroad , old railway carriage .
150150:9	And you had to that yourself ?
150151:8	We had to do that , the stevedores had to do that , my first of stevedoring .
150151:28	We had to do that , the stevedores had to do that , my first of stevedoring .
150163:7	I had to go over there just to see how dockers worked over there , to see if I could improve it here , well I could n't because dockers would n't do what they , they were doing in Holland .
150167:9	No , had to keep this four men instead of two .
150177:14	So eventually the they had to give in in the end .
150315:9	so you had to put that to one side .
150318:12	Did they actually have to bring it up the estuary ?
150336:10	But that had to be shared between the number of men
150338:18	And did they , they must have had lean times if they sat around and waited for a boat , one did n't come in some days may be .
150344:69	It would have done but he , he used to be what we called a proper chain smoker , oh he must have smoked hundreds of Woodbines in a week , must have been hundreds , that was his life .
150344:98	It would have done but he , he used to be what we called a proper chain smoker , oh he must have smoked hundreds of Woodbines in a week , must have been hundreds , that was his life .
150355:10	So they had to , the they were purely working for themselves ?
150364:23	Oh would they , they 'd have to
150384:172	see so if th if they get time off and they want extra men , they phone ' em up or somebody with a boat got bloke in the erm radio tower , cos you got a radio tower on the dock now which every ship that come into port or leave the port have to go through the radio tower and that man 's employed twenty four hours a day , seven days a week .
150391:52	Well because they used to know through the agent and of course them , them would have to hang , row down the river and hang about
150411:45	These ones up in the town , did the boatmen used to have to go up the town to find
150416:71	Going back to the agents up in the town , the boatmen to get information about a ship coming in they would have to go up to the town
150417:11	They would have to go up to the town , yes
150457:35	If , if one turned up with a dirty one they have to buy the beer that 's how they used to be .
150515:9	So you had to buy your own stuff then ?
150516:8	You had to buy your own stuff , I bought a pair of thigh boots and they were all made with leather and he and I used to put neat's-foot oil on them and I could roll them down just like a b just like a boot .
150521:28	That 's right yes and th the Corporation had to sewage out four ways to s supply ' em .
150535:33	In the olden days , what did they used to have to do down there ?
150595:21	Cos that was about , that must have been about erm er I 'd say time about , yes I should say about nineteen , nineteen thirty four and they built a pipeline out from the sewer outfall and they put two dolphins out there , and they reckon that the water , when it 's purified just to go into the river was really clean water .
150605:72	Well the point was you see , we had a dumb hopper , the dumb hopper was towed by an old tug , they had to tow that dumb hopper to sea , what was called dumb cos they ai n't got no engines and so that was towed to sea and then course the er the dumb hopper ha had four winches , hand winches and then they , cos they had the chains on the but the steam hopper
150618:11	What you had to fix the door ?
150619:7	We had to fix the door then then of course the with the big tow on the other dumb hopper to sea .
150621:38	Could you fix the door from inside or fr or did you have to do it from outside ?
150622:11	No you have to , you 'd , you 'd , you 'd do it in the middle in the hold , not in the middle of the hold on the side of the hold , where your , where your air tank was .
150640:63	Because once the ship come up that 's still a certain amount of water in the hold which that must be , cos then once you heave your door up then of course you load your ship again and then cos your ship was going down the more mud you put in , course mud is heavier than water
150652:125	I mean you could never load er , you could never load a hopper down to its plimsoll mark with peat , that was so light and cos you could n't put any more in so you used to have to take it to sea perhaps we we well you would call it half loaded .
150674:21	Well I do n't know that must have been some clever fella to do it did n't he ?
150742:20	inch by two and you had to tell these dockers what size it was and they 'd take it out of that particular stack .
150806:11	So the men had to be there at the right time you had t ?
150808:11	So it all had to be organized really did n't it ?
150822:160	you do not mind my taking this method of answering your letter and I hope that you , I did not put you to too much trouble to locate a recorder to listen to the tape , I am just too lazy to write it all down and think that what I have to say I can put it better in words than what I can on paper , I 'll let you do that part .
150824:52	To go back to the Gdynia one on the ninth of October nineteen forty three , I have to state that when our crew arrived in England we went to er through school at Bovingdon for a couple of weeks then we were assigned to the Ninety Second Bomb Group and they wanna be sure we fit in .
150855:87	The er other thing about our crew was that er one time there , I guess after was the only one that got back and they , they had to get him back on flying service .
150874:9	Nobody must have been his bombardier , mine was and my navigator was and I see his would have been .
150875:15	His flight engineer must have been mine was .
150881:20	Because if you will have a had to get a recorder to listen to this side so you might as well put something on the other side and send it to me but of course there is no rush and in return you 'd be showing you take off anything or any part that you care to use .
150899:10	Aye it must be .
150974:10	I 'll have to come up I 'll have to come up and see your
150974:31	I 'll have to come up I 'll have to come up and see your
151167:27	actually I , the dose that I had to take , I cut them down to see how it would go but , I must admit , I suffered from it Doctor ,
151167:80	actually I , the dose that I had to take , I cut them down to see how it would go but , I must admit , I suffered from it Doctor ,
151340:7	He must have looked in the kitchen window .
151438:7	I had to send for the police .
151450:7	I had to get the police to get him back .
151481:10	And he must have been , I 've a feeling he was standing somewhere bloody well
151640:9	Cos they must be a wee bit too strong .
151719:7	You must be the only one
151787:9	Then I had to get this one .
151850:37	I got up to go to the toilet but they er must have been too quick for me , .
151894:47	Would be a , be quite a few calls , but we 'll just maybe have to try and I do n't know what we 'll do .
151896:14	Whether we 'll have to take them off Thursday now , put them forward to Wednesday .
151952:44	And it gets in your hair and it gets in your clothes , she must have been listening to the television .
152337:9	So it must be making a difference .
152572:10	But I had to get an appointment , I had to get something I I put hot water
152572:30	But I had to get an appointment , I had to get something I I put hot water
152914:24	I said I 'm going to have to clear that and delete a bit of stuff off and load it with and load WordPerfect again .
152922:42	And you have n't got a utility to do it , you just have to take it out and put it back on again ?
152961:19	The people upstairs who must have got it .
153155:18	You know what I have to do with my G W Basic ?
153156:7	I have to sit there like typing in random keywords to see if it 's a keyword .
153189:39	Erm , gorilla is throwing bananas at the gorilla and you have to get that traj je trajectory right .
153192:18	you 'll see I had to calculate parabola ,
153204:23	It goes creeping round and you have to pick up numbers in order
153207:9	and you have to use your cursor keys
153210:12	You do n't have to play if you do n't want to .
153287:7	I must say n nobody knows , probably a two bit .
153314:10	You actually have to pick a sub-option .
153340:61	Yeah , we 've got a wrong driver and I did n't have one in my things so I might have to regroup with a proper let 's have a look in DOS and see what mouse drivers it 's got .
153395:10	Oh this must be like mouse .
153641:9	Do n't have to .
153645:15	yeah , sometimes you have to show added precaution .
153746:20	Well you 're going to have to get rid of it , so .
153753:10	Rather than have to bail out and do it again .
153835:28	probably wo n't be the first time you have to edit it either .
153973:13	And you 'll have to tell me the name of your
153997:14	Yeah you 'd have to , would n't you ?
154121:7	you must have billions of them , ?
154253:40	But what I 'm saying is that the er m Q Basic must have the facilities to put those menus up by just sort of saying put up menu .
154359:15	that , that , had to go before Windows .
154360:33	File control box and files and buffers it will have to probably
154422:52	Well you could yeah I guess you I er mean it 's something they had to write into the program to check the version number is n't it ?
154448:10	I do have to type it again .
154677:58	I , I , I do n't know how to use WordPerfect and I hate , I occasionally have to .
154680:10	and I have to translate them into DOS , and it 's a hassle and I do n't like .
154839:8	We have to be silent , we have to be still .
154839:26	We have to be silent , we have to be still .
154873:28	On the night of Good Friday , the apostles must have felt a painful sense of loss .
154924:37	In order to fill this in , this little er section you have to look at the er the chapter that they recommend you , er Saint Matthew 's Gospel chapter twenty eight .
154929:7	You have to read that in order to er
154987:23	So just to recap again we have to try and link Ascension Day to Pentecost .
155009:33	What Jesus is saying is , you do n't have to be afraid of death any more .
155014:19	There is something you have to do in order to receive the gift .
155015:70	Even if it 's only stretching out your hand to receive the gift , it 's something yo you all of us have to do .
155021:14	Oh yeah , somebody must have been there , you must have put it in yourself , you must have done .
155021:34	Oh yeah , somebody must have been there , you must have put it in yourself , you must have done .
155021:57	Oh yeah , somebody must have been there , you must have put it in yourself , you must have done .
155048:28	But for our need at this moment , we have to look at what the Holy Spirit is doing .
155129:31	Peter said to them , each of you must turn away from sin , and be baptised in the name of Jesus Christ , and you shall receive the gift of his Holy Spirit .
155169:93	I think He judges with mercy , you know erm it 's erm perhaps sometimes when we 're asked to be in a situation where we have to give an opinion , then it should be , if we have wisdom er a merciful erm balance .
155181:9	But Peter had to accept it .
155182:11	And Peper Peter had to accept it not just once you know and then he was a changed man .
155188:17	You know so you have to reach out on a daily basis for these gifts .
155189:187	You know so when you 're confirmed , it wo n't be , okay I 'm on the boat now , it will be making use of those gifts , whatever they may be , and they 'll be uniquely your own in each one , the mix 'll be uni uniquely you know , to the person , you 'll have to make use of it on a daily basis , not just simply , okay I 'm on the boat .
155295:26	Yes it 's not erm you do have to sort of take your sock and shoe off , but only of one foot .
155339:13	However they have had to prove their worth for online transaction processing .
155394:64	One is the performance aspect because every time we need to access the relational database across the network we have to send a large piece of transactional logic , a piece of S Q L code , across the network , and that could be significant in size .
155399:35	But the S Q L code which is sent to it has to be interpreted when it gets to the server machine , and we all know the difference between compiled and interpreted code .
155401:86	If we decide to change the way we do business or change the way the application works or how it models our environment , then we have to revisit using this architecture every single client machine on the network and upgrade that particular business function .
155544:100	Using single devices be they terminals or erm perhaps Microsoft Windows in the future we 'll need to categor deal with the different categories of users and the different devices they have to deal with .
155556:22	In fantasy land if we ever have to replace our systems we can of course simply switch off the old one and switch on the new one .
155569:13	Of course I have to say that er software fails as well sometimes and indeed one of the problems we all have is that with today 's hardware technologies some of the er computers are so fast that it really reaches the bugs rather quicker .
155574:10	You only have to look back over what 's er happened over the last few years in terms of for example O S Two , Microsoft Windows , a variety of Unix , and you 'll see that technologies will come along and however sound a decision you make at one point in time the market circumstances and potentially mean that what was right for you then not the right .
155575:21	This is the world we have to live with and find a way .
155584:74	So we need to build our systems to meet the requirements we have today because we could n't justify more and yet we have to build in the scale scalability so that systems can grow to meet the growing requirements which are almost inevitable .
155590:9	The systems have got to deliver data reliably otherwise they 're not of any value at all and yet they 're going to have to deal with unpredictable events such as network failure , software failures , hardware failures , user failures or whatever .

155601:52	heath fees , there 's heath fees , and there 's all , all you have to pay for the heath fees and all , you know .
155628:13	Well , they had to , they only raced at Newmarket .
155629:66	All through the war , they raced at Newmarket see fetched it all to one meeting , so that they did n't have to travel about .
155630:22	See , the animal did n't have to travel about so and most of the trainers come here , you see .
155639:134	And , all run here , everything was run here , and animals , animals that won here , well er well I think they put them down as better animals than animals that raced before the war , you know , cos they had to do such a lot in a short time .
155642:7	We had to had to plough that up , and put and put er feed in it .
155642:14	We had to had to plough that up , and put and put er feed in it .
155663:16	During the war you had to grow food on it , you said .
155665:16	During the war you had to grow food on it , you said to me .
155667:7	You had to grow food
155671:7	you had to grow food on those areas ,
155678:10	They 'd have to give so much away .
155680:7	We had to grow potatoes and saffron everything , you know .
155683:18	That 's why we have to do it .
155708:72	Oh , it did n't interfere did n't interfere with th did n't interfere , the only thing about it , you had to do everything in daylight , there were no lights allowed at nights , you know .
155712:7	You had to do everything in daylight .
155713:76	You know very , that was , that was about the hardest part about it , cos no sooner you were done , you had to start again you understand ?
155715:11	Cos you had to get , do it with lights , and every window was blacked over , oh terrible .
155725:107	Well , you see you finish in the morning about half past , half past twelve we used to , cos no sooner you get your dinner and had a drink , you had to be back again two o' clock or half past two to start on ' em again , you see ,
155738:35	Oh yeah , we raced just the same even though we had to do it early , so that some of them leave , and we started at sometimes half past eleven .
155749:17	But you see you had to do as good as the same amount now , you know .
155887:56	houses in them days , if you worked on a p work on a place , you had to live on a place , you see , if you got the sack you had to get out of ' em .
155887:105	houses in them days , if you worked on a p work on a place , you had to live on a place , you see , if you got the sack you had to get out of ' em .
155921:37	Or come and send for him , h he what has to be in the yard , the blacksmith has to look thirty to forty horses their blacksmith has to look round every one of them .
155921:61	Or come and send for him , h he what has to be in the yard , the blacksmith has to look thirty to forty horses their blacksmith has to look round every one of them .
155921:84	Or come and send for him , h he what has to be in the yard , the blacksmith has to look thirty to forty horses their blacksmith has to look round every one of them .
155923:22	Every one of those horses he has to look round for fo all four feet up .
155942:9	So you have to be
155943:7	You had to be certified and serve your apprenticeship .
155950:13	Well , you had to send miles for them , did n't you er er blacksmith .
155951:122	Blacksmiths were the thing on the side of the road , did n't he do all the wheeling , mend your wheels , and all horse , all iron wheels , and things like that , wo n't years ago , and you had to send for him to come and do ' em , w well , he had men that he 'd , that he 'd taught like boys , apprentices .
155984:10	And you had to get , get a bit of paper and you drew a straight line , straight line , see like that , and if he had two white legs you put a cross , two white see , if he had a long one , he had put a big cross , if he had a long , two long white leg , if he had me behind you put a cross .
156026:25	They paid you for it , they had to pay , to pay
156048:9	So you had to be pally so that your owners help one another .
156067:23	That 's why Lord would n't have to give all that money .
156073:12	Yes , you have to have a lead horse in work .
156108:12	And you all had to go over that side .
156121:14	See cos you have to cross over ' em .
156122:7	You have to start at the top of the town that way , and go down over down and come round like that , finish off start down Norwich Road and come up Bury Road .
156144:9	Then you have to pay another forfeit if you leave him in .
156151:63	I do n't know , I do n't think , think it 's altered now , years ago you had to enter your y Derby horse .
156152:7	You had to enter them as foals , and then when you entered them it cost you fifty pounds to enter them , and it cost you fifty pounds for every quarter of that lifetime of that foal .
156154:13	Why did you have to enter them as foals ?
156218:27	where were you born , because you must be one of the oldest residents in Needham ?
156258:204	No that 's right , as I say but erm anyway then after that when I left at say sixteen , you see , er er er a friend of ours who was a railway clerk at Needham Station came and told us that they were taking on girls on the Railway Company and would I like to do it and so of course I had to pass exams and er actually , can I read some notes that
156269:48	Then I was told that girls were being taken on the railways so I had to go to Ipswich and take two more exams and started work as a booking clerk at Needham Station when I was sixteen .
156273:27	Oh yes er yes code yes then I had to learn that
156281:10	So I had to take an eye test , I remember .
156319:100	Er taking off and sending telegrams , you see , erm then I was told that the Railway Company wer were taking girls on again , so I applied and I had to go to Ipswich to pass two more exams , you see , and er and started work and the in the Catering Manager 's office at Ipswich Station as , as a clerk doing typing and general office work as the Manager had to go on the district .
156319:233	Er taking off and sending telegrams , you see , erm then I was told that the Railway Company wer were taking girls on again , so I applied and I had to go to Ipswich to pass two more exams , you see , and er and started work and the in the Catering Manager 's office at Ipswich Station as , as a clerk doing typing and general office work as the Manager had to go on the district .
156357:24	Well what sort of meals did you have to provide ?
156374:91	I 've got a , a photograph somewhere where we had this trestle table er on the platform and if you were the tea and of course the men had to stay o overtime , they did n't get paid for it and we , we it was a seven day week for us , we were never paid for Sunday .
156402:30	Well , and I went to Ipswich well it must have been just after the war then
156411:131	They had er his name was Jimmy they had er well one used t one old gentleman used to be a yes and his name was Jimmy , the waiter , that 's right I , I get a , I have to think because I , I sometimes get mixed up and I 'm at Cambridge and you see it was a long time ago , you see , so , since I was young and I was then .
156431:136	I and the girls , that 's , that 's all they got fifteen shillings because I was in the office I got a pound and mind you we slept in , we had all our food , you see , and we had to all sleep in .
156441:12	Well no I had to share a room with a , with a , I think there were five beds .
156528:127	I wanted to go to Scotland and I remember I came to say goodbye to my parents and that was in the evening and I went by train to Liverpool Street and it was pouring with rain and I had to make my way , I had a taxi across to Euston , you see , and er and I went up th the left side of the country , see , past Carlisle and and then across and across and then and to Greenock er er to Dunoon , you see .
156543:7	You must have been in about in your mid twenties ?
156548:92	I said , no , and she said oh I have lots of times , I only live at Manchester , you see , and of course , you had to go by boat you see , and I caught the boat train from Ipswich at eight o' clock in the morning and I got to Manchester at lunchtime about one and then went on to Liverpool and the train there took us almost down to the docks .
156550:7	I had to save ninepence because I had these free passes .
156567:294	I was rather late back , when I got back I heard a knock on my bedroom door and she said it 's Miss and er I said , oh come in , I undid the door and she came in and er and so she said to me er , I just had a telephone message from Peel er to say that you have been subpoenaed to go the Police Court next Thursday and I said what a day out of my holiday and she said , well I 'm sorry but you 'll have to go .
156569:106	So the two of us went off to Peel and er anyway they paid us , they paid for our lunch and er and so that was alright and of course I had to go in the witness box , you see and swear on the bible , you know , the whole truth , nothing but the truth , you see .
156644:143	We stayed on board and we went up on to every deck and there was even a gentleman , he showed us up on the bridge on that er on that and , and of course there was the little shop and I bought I thought I must buy something on the Queen Elizabeth and I bought a pen .
156696:7	He must be eighty , because I mean there was n't all that much difference in our ages .
156698:97	Well I , he lived at Stowmarket for years but then I heard not so long ago that they had moved to Ipswich but where I do n't know but they must be , whether he 's than I have now I do n't know either .
156817:26	When you worked at Needham , you must have seen all the toings , comings and goings on station yard , yard and a lot of cattle coming and going .
156855:12	Oh , he must about ninety .
156858:24	I ca n't remember maybe , he must be about ninety .
156892:41	Oh , that 's what I mean er and you 'll have to make haste wo n't you ?
156914:95	He er , Hugh and I used to come up every day do what we could , you see , in those days if you had a stroke you had to lay there till you died .
156983:135	you see I moved a bit more now but and I I 've still got good hearing er apart from this ear here , this ear , I ca n't hear so well , quite so well , this side , you see so I always have to say excuse me while I , hang on while I turn off the television , you see , and then they have to wait a minute till I turn it off and then what I do is because I have this phone extension put in
156983:204	you see I moved a bit more now but and I I 've still got good hearing er apart from this ear here , this ear , I ca n't hear so well , quite so well , this side , you see so I always have to say excuse me while I , hang on while I turn off the television , you see , and then they have to wait a minute till I turn it off and then what I do is because I have this phone extension put in
157034:7	We had to pay er there was two lots of erm tyres , there was one set of buses were fitted with and another one with or I forget which it was there but I know those three were involved at some time or other and we used to record the mileage , send it off to them , showing what each bus ran during the month .
157035:131	How many days it was out of service and this that and the other and erm they used to send us an invoice on the mileage run because at the same time we knew what tyres were on the bus we had to inform them of any tyre changes and they kept records the same as us .
157048:31	Odd gloves we never used to charge for had to get rid of them and er so apart from those two offices er there was immediately above us was a biggish office spreading over these two blocks of offices , called the ticket office and there at that time about eleven girls working in it on tickets .
157061:21	They was made that two men had to lift ' em , so there was hardly likely that any thief was gonna get in there and run off with one of these boxes cos you 'd never lift it .
157065:9	Did you have to wear a uniform to go to work ?
157068:76	He was n't allowed to work that day , so people turned up in a white shirt and tie and looking smart , they had to wear uniforms even a cap but unfortunately nowadays , although a lot of the I have seen quite a few people their uniform has changed since I left , but erm they do come to work in very very casual work now .
157072:39	There was no , no uniform for the office , so you had to provide your own ?
157102:109	They were very very reliable because erm , the motive power was in a motor , electric motor , not a lot of parts to go wrong but er once you started the motor buses they had to send people away to to be taught the mechanics of motor buses , so you had the old die-hards of the fetters , trolley buses , who never did take to motor buses and course the younger ones came into their own then , who were able to adapt to the modern motor bus .
157126:28	I volunteered for the Grenadier Guards , well I had to go to Chelsea Barracks and after a week there , they decided that I was n't medically fit for them , although the doctor or the M O at the Ipswich Recruiting Officer said , oh yes , you 're A one you 'll be fine for the guard but cos I was fairly well built , stature wise .
157152:137	Erm , so I was constantly getting rises , less my service pay and erm it got to a state there where sometimes my service pay was more than what the erm salary I would have got at home was and my wife had to pay to keep my superannuation live .
157153:7	She had to
157156:25	The duties being erm what a man had to do to cover that er period of that scheduling .
157158:12	Now that had to be manned by a driver and a conductor for that day .
157160:9	So you had to have , in that day erm , about five men to cover one bus right the way through , can you just a moment .
157188:62	At the same time they had on Mondays and Tuesday we used to sell weekly tickets , so they had to go out in another box on Mondays and Tuesdays .
157202:148	Well that was the , the erm union for us , erm I think erm one of the great assets of being in public transport was that we were in a local erm pension scheme , erm when , when we in the office started , we had to wait until we were eighteen and then we had to wait for a vacancy because there was a limited number of people that the Council were prepared to back by paying a similar amount .
157202:178	Well that was the , the erm union for us , erm I think erm one of the great assets of being in public transport was that we were in a local erm pension scheme , erm when , when we in the office started , we had to wait until we were eighteen and then we had to wait for a vacancy because there was a limited number of people that the Council were prepared to back by paying a similar amount .
157203:12	Drivers and conductors had to wait three years , they had to be employed three years before they were accepted into the pension scheme but you know , believe me I 'm glad that I paid in for it .
157203:32	Drivers and conductors had to wait three years , they had to be employed three years before they were accepted into the pension scheme but you know , believe me I 'm glad that I paid in for it .
157205:73	Erm I told you that erm during the war if my army wage went above what the recorded salary was , my wife had to pay to keep the superannuation going
157239:19	said erm , oh we must have something .
157252:29	He , he did it once or twice , had to give up when he got to the mouth of the River Orwell because he mistimed the currents but he did , he did eventually do it from Stoke Bathing Place to Felixstowe .
157257:150	They are increased now obviously but erm , you know to put anything on a tuppeny fare then was well a ha ' penny which was twenty five percent on terrible , every year we were going for a fare increase and in those days you really had to go through the Traffic Commissioners .
157258:7	You had to go to Cambridge .
157259:20	Loads and loads of information had to be supplied .
157260:8	You had to satisfy the Traffic Commissioners , that what you are proposing would , would answer the cause , would n't give rise to erm great hardships to the travelling public and erm oh you 're preparing a fare increase about a year before it actually came up to , in front of the Commissioners and then he would erm , perhaps make some alterations or give you a date when you could apply .
157261:7	You had to then notify the public at least twenty f twenty four I , no fourteen days before it was due to come in .
157263:141	So i it was n't a very easy thing then to get them and as I say you 'd be preparing a fare increase which , perhaps a ha ' penny on certain fares and a penny on fares above a certain range and you had to allow for depreciation , or resistance in the public travelling but er as long as you could always bring in a little extra from a fare increase it was worthwhile going forward .
157264:42	As I say it was very very difficult in those days , you had to satisfy the Traffic Commissions .
157282:59	Another thing you might not realize is that erm , erm when you ordered motor buses you had to get authority from the Ministry of Transport and you used to appl apply for a bus grant .
157284:65	It got phased out so that the Ministry did n't pay anything at all but to get this grant you had to keep tremendous records copies of invoices and you had to get er and the bus grant and the , the permission from them .
157284:100	It got phased out so that the Ministry did n't pay anything at all but to get this grant you had to keep tremendous records copies of invoices and you had to get er and the bus grant and the , the permission from them .
157315:125	So they had me as continuity and I got the job and it was a bit of a struggle because I 'd always been traffic , traffic at work but this was a little bit different in that if you had to do more accountancy and I had to pick it up .
157315:146	So they had me as continuity and I got the job and it was a bit of a struggle because I 'd always been traffic , traffic at work but this was a little bit different in that if you had to do more accountancy and I had to pick it up .
157317:19	Sorry Chief Administrator Officer and I had to provide quite a lot of statistical information which I 'd never done before but nevertheless I , I made a fairly reasonable job of it , I had an assistant and erm I , I think I got fairly well known amongst the councillors and people who mattered and then went .
157323:148	Well , he did there in , in the various agreements there , there were scheduling anomalies which erm , if they I ca n't recall the exact wording now but if they er , their average wage , working week was between forty two and forty four hours , they had to get make up pay and all that sort of thing .
157356:7	we had to spend a couple of years erm longer at school .
157370:94	well yes , yes I wondered whether I 'd got it right you know , it sounded just a silly thing to ask and erm and I erm had to consider that probably asked whether I had erm made a mistake in my shorthand before , before I actually typed it but erm , anyway they seemed erm reasonably satisfied and everybody was very kindly and erm considerate and
157385:60	quite easy , well it was comparatively easy , only trouble was of course that erm at night erm one had to go right down from County Hall to Barrett Corner to get on the bus because they were so full by the time they got to County Hall and erm so I used to walk down there with erm a chap from the Education Department , who was in the Works and Stores , a chap and erm , he was quite helpful .
157406:110	you were really kicking your heels and erm quite apart from which in the winter time the er conditions were pretty grim because they had the erm anti-splinter netting over the windows and erm big blinds which had to be drawn as soon as it was dusk because er , of course you were n't allowed to show a light and erm if that was it became really thick
157418:16	Mm , we did have to , oddly enough there was always a tradition when I started er of working on Tuesdays erm an extra quarter of an hour because that was Committee Day
157443:46	but er they were a bit of a nuisance because more than once , I must admit I erm , I collided with them which rather made me aware of their presence but anyway erm , then just beyond I am sorry , on the erm right hand side , a little way down this corridor , were the stairs up to the next floor which was in those days Public Health
157476:69	They were always erm , making caustic comments about the entries in the , in the log book which the telephonists had to keep , erm , of the messages that came through
157526:64	and erm , then of course when they reached Felixstowe , everything was a bit chaotic because th they had to sleep on the floor in the schools down there
157528:63	and then they were bussed to an Acton crossroads where erm a rather bemused erm billeting , Chief Billeting Officer then had to decide where the buses had got to go to
157550:14	and erm we had to write to parents and er collect contributions which were overdue .
157571:81	with them and one or two remained behind but er , yes it was interesting how erm I always found it rather funny that er you had to go to Leiston to Sudbury to evacuated to school
157578:41	We used to call it higher education , and erm so we had to deal with the , the Lowestoft Grammar School in the same way as we did with the other schools and also with the erm Technical Institute which was at Lowestoft , that was the only erm purpose-built erm centre for further education in the , in the county at that time .
157621:9	Mm , must have been very difficult then to get around sometimes then
157662:230	and erm these were poultry breeders be erm scattered all over the count er county who yes the erm accredited poultry breeding station scheme was erm initiated by the Ministry of Agriculture and erm there were a number of farms scattered all over the county erm where they were open to inspection and erm we had erm had a Mrs who went round and inspected the flocks and erm they had to reapply each year to erm sustain their accreditation
157668:57	and erm there was no final erm sort of er judgment to be had so erm then we had to call meetings of this little Sub Committee who finally made up their minds and I remember typing reports , quite long reports , about erm Rhode Island Reds er crossed with Light Sussex and Light Sussex crossed with er Brown and erm I , I knew precious little about poultry at that time .
157673:83	Another sideline of this erm little secondary education section that erm Arthur was in charge of was the library and erm the Library Sub Committee he erm had to look out for much to the annoyance of erm Bill who was the librarian at the time
157677:84	Erm so that erm there were all sorts of erm little by- products from the agriculture and library and that sort of thing that er we had to erm deal with .
157681:9	but he had to report , of course , to the Library Sub Committee
157706:29	and fifty pounds of that was loaned which had to be repaid at the end of the course in sixteen equal quarterly instalments .
157708:90	So that erm erm the collection of of the loan was erm quite a major operation in itself because though erm there was a form of agreement and each agreement had to have two sureties and erm you could always go to the sureties if the student after the course
157712:62	and erm at that time of course when we got to that sort of crisis we erm had to send a memo over to the er Clerk of the Council 's Department er .
157729:126	and er that may sound er a bit exaggerated but I can assure you that 's what happened , that er , to go to , to be able to file these , these little scraps of paper they had to stick it on another sheet
157812:18	Erm , of course it has to be remembered that all these lectures , or at least most of them , were erm voluntary compulsion and the men used to turn up because they were told to and er whether or not they showed little or no interest very often and it was all erm well a bit of a waste of time .
157830:131	Erm just er when I first started , I 've already mentioned I think that erm there are about seventeen erm students at universities with major scholarships within the maximum of this erm hundred and fifty pounds a year and erm we inter had to interview all these erm applicants , erm which was n't a very arduous task because there were n't so many of them but
157832:7	we had to get erm reports from the Examining Boards erm on their performances , in the Higher School Certificate Exam erm , they had to take two main subjects and two subsidiaries and according to the recommendations of the Examining Boards , then , by and large , they er received a major award or , or they did n't but erm there was a consolation prize for those who did n't erm get a major award because there were a few , what they called , special loans erm offered by the Education Committee .
157832:72	we had to get erm reports from the Examining Boards erm on their performances , in the Higher School Certificate Exam erm , they had to take two main subjects and two subsidiaries and according to the recommendations of the Examining Boards , then , by and large , they er received a major award or , or they did n't but erm there was a consolation prize for those who did n't erm get a major award because there were a few , what they called , special loans erm offered by the Education Committee .
157835:31	and , but of course , they were loans and had to be repaid at the end of the course .
157880:199	The grants , the of the grants of course increased over the years and the main thing about erm awards of course was to assess them and this is something which erm , I always felt a bit self conscious about because , we had this erm very comprehensive form where parents and erm , oh individuals when they were the students themselves had to complete and give very precise details of income
157882:42	and financial circumstances and erm , this was something of course that I had to leave to the people who were working got himself another job .
157883:44	So that erm , nobody really kn was the most monotonous job when you had to erm assess literally thousands of students in the end .
157887:91	but erm , we never used to get the new rates of grants and the new regulations out from the erm Ministry until oh early June and all this work had to be done , erm , obviously before the
157904:19	and erm they used to have to send these cards to Birmingham to be processed and there used to be a van going out from er Milner House to Birmingham .
157974:53	but one that 's gonna top all that without any shadow of a doubt , he must be the youngest pensioner this side of the Mississippi and that 's Alan , retired executive officer who 's on a busman 's holiday this week Roger union solicitor Bill retired N I O , hopefully wo n't be having any accidents this week retired education and training manager .
158020:60	The fundamental issue is this that if the Labour Party is to remain a party of labour it must have as an integral part the trade union movement , it 's as simple as that , colleagues !
158029:53	We stand for solidarity between workers of all races and colours and we are opposed and must stop unscrupulous politicians and racist groups using the race issue to divide working people !
158033:53	The facts are there there has been a staggering rise in attacks and murders this union must take the lead we call for the British government to bring in legislation to ban the evil nationalist and fascist political parties , and insist that government strengthens legal protection for third country nationals .
158039:43	New unions have now emerged which we have not faced before we must not dodge these challenges because they may appear difficult or hard and we must be prepared to learn off anybody who has something to show us to close our minds would be a mistake .

To my mum who at the moment does n't enjoy the best of health , who over the years has had to endure a daughter who , er , on some occasions has not been a very great help to her , has guided me through very difficult times , as mums always do .
158198:10	And that must be the cry tell them , go and join your own party .
158200:7	We must organize against them in the wards and in the constituencies to drive this menace out !
158205:23	Giles is a longstanding me I must finish my speech
158227:115	There is also the case for state financing , which is the position of the Party but for the foreseeable future the Labour Party will need trades union money , and as Steve said even our fiercest critics have to admit that the money the union gives to the Party is open and above board and that 's more than can be said of the money that 's used to finance the Conservative Party .
158238:15	Now his view obviously has to be seriously considered put forward , as it is , by a leader who has the support , when he was elected , of ninety percent of the Party , including ninety percent of the unions .
158239:12	So we will have to consider it .
158271:16	A much wider consultation process must be initiated , before far-reaching changes can be agreed .
158272:63	The whole question of an adequate income in retirement can be achieved , and changes necessary to enable them must be worked at .
158282:7	You have to earn enough for long enough , ninety percent of your working life , to qualify .
158284:20	The conclusions are , discrimination must end at the earliest opportunity for both men and women changes should include a full and p proper consultation exercise .
158290:7	We must ensure that we campaign as hard as possible , that sixty becomes the state pension age for all our members , men and women .
158292:7	We must campaign strongly to ensure that men and women still have a state pension that is n't just a pittance at sixty .
158296:11	This Tory proposal must be seen by one of the most unacceptable , and unprincipled acts of this government .
158316:23	It was bad enough when pensioners had to pay the standing charges on their gas , water and telephone bills .
158317:25	It is even worse now that they have got to pay V A T on those bills as well .
158318:9	These pensioners have to pay standing charges whether or not they use the service , just to ensure that they can use the service when needed .
158335:59	President , congress I 've gotta up and say to you , I had , I 've had to borrow the wife 's glasses this morning cos I left mine in the car
158340:64	When the government broke in , broke the link between the R P I and the old age pension , they must have known that this kind of rise would not be paid by our pensioners .
158353:62	We have heard quite a lot , colleagues , about pensions and pension schemes over the last eighteen months perhaps we have to actually thank Mr Maxwell for raising the issue , even if those pensioners he cheated wo n't thank him .
158359:186	This time bomb is ticking away , colleagues , and in about twenty years ' time , we 'll be back to where we were we 'll have a lot of people who 've got small pensions , based on their previous employment with a health authority or a local authority , British Gas or the electricity companies then they 've had to go out on the open market and they will be under-funded and have inadequate pension when they retire .
158381:9	The law must be strengthened and operate on an open basis , rather than under a cloak of secrecy .
158390:66	For the prospect of a retirement pension for all those presently under fifty years of age is looking distinctly forlorn we must protect the pension rights of all contributing members we must insist that trustees are elected from the shop floor and not appointed by some faceless director who may not even reside in this country .
158390:97	For the prospect of a retirement pension for all those presently under fifty years of age is looking distinctly forlorn we must protect the pension rights of all contributing members we must insist that trustees are elected from the shop floor and not appointed by some faceless director who may not even reside in this country .
158391:7	We must never again allow , now that we 're all too painfully aware of the consequences any company to cheat and swindle any working man or woman after a lifetime 's toil from the right to a happy and dignified and financially secure retirement .
158400:83	President , congress we know that the Tory government , Tories ' er agenda is to abolish State pension , thus more and more people will rel have to rely on private , and company pension .
158434:7	Heseltine had to find a subsidy to stop the coal revolt by Tory backbenchers a short-term subsidy to the coal industry .
158483:71	To cut entitlement to unemployment benefit to tax invalidity benefit and to mean test benefits congress such a tax most vulnerable in our society must be opposed by the trade union movement .
158533:48	It is to the shame of this Tory government that er er our senior citizens have to struggle to feed and clothe themselves and to try to keep warm , and as inadequate pensions that they receive from this government if you compare the way in the other European countries what they get and what the British government gives to our old age pensioners , our senior citizens they 're more they 're worse off than actually second class citizens .
158651:28	Her employers then told her that she would have to work full time , double the hours , for only two pounds an hour .
158652:96	Because she is nineteen the legally enforceable minimum rate of pay of three pounds and sixpence does n't ap apply and the client , that 's the CAB client , will have to accept the new conditions or just be sacked .
158666:7	He must live on some other planet .
158688:102	He got into a little bit of trouble over some tax payers ' contributions a short time ago and I particularly enjoyed his explanation of why we , the tax payers of this country , had to pay for refurbishing his house and garden .
158690:7	This must be the first time in human history that a swimming pool has been invented as an anti-terrorist measure .
158704:7	We must n't surrender to the propaganda .
158721:10	No one has to prove that the Conservatives have failed , every one knows that , but what we 've got to show now is that the Labour alternative can succeed .
158779:28	question about redundancies in Liverpool Council I have to say that th in this particular case the report does much less than justice to what has happened .
158815:17	Within twenty four hours they had to accept new posts , possibly at a lower rate of pay , and or shorter hours , or be made redundant .
158818:46	It took us until the following Friday to get to accept that they had to follow procedure , by which time of course the damage was done .
158819:30	In his latest to staff Mr states , we must treat our staff differently .
158870:111	If this takes away the full employment from others , that 's even better , and if this helps to undermine the trade union organization , well that is even better still , but we must fight , we must fight to make sure that this does not happen and colleagues , if we are brutally honest , this is exactly what is happening .
158870:122	If this takes away the full employment from others , that 's even better , and if this helps to undermine the trade union organization , well that is even better still , but we must fight , we must fight to make sure that this does not happen and colleagues , if we are brutally honest , this is exactly what is happening .
158872:66	If we are to substantiate the trade union membership and provide at leas the minimum protection for our members , then we have to ensure that Sunday working remains optional and it continues to attract the premium rate of pay and that way , colleagues , we can all benefit .
158902:38	Students , part-time women workers , part-time male workers , they 've all had to go down the road because of recession , because they 've been driven into it by this government 's policies .
158922:12	The shops would have to go through that phase , so there 'd be a local union protest , a cit or the town or the country or whatever they could do against it .
158967:49	Even companies who do not want to trade on a Sunday now feel they have to in order to compete .
158974:41	Sundays are special and people who choose to work on Sundays must be paid appropriate premium rates for their labour .
158976:9	Sunday working has to be voluntary .
159010:150	The Section Committee are concerned , and regret , that the multi-fibre trade agreement still remains in the balance and this agreement , delegates , is essential if your members , our members , are going to have a job in the U K industry and that agreement as we still campaign internationally must contain a social clause .
159013:31	The prohibition of child labour and forced labour and that has got to be a prerequisite for a world market in textile and clothing .
159019:54	Levis have pulled out of China , they do n't like the conditions there , and we have got to persuade more to do that .
159022:132	But if T V journalists can film children working in factories , if our own International Trade Union can see and highlight , as they do , the catastrophic effects on the lives and health of children , and of the exploitation , then so must the retailers who place the order .
159030:23	You 're probably alright there I have to say .
159035:9	Our slogan must be , Child Labour , I Wo n't Wear It .
159058:12	Such consultation will have to be with a view to reaching agreement .
159135:10	We 've had to make a million pounds savings this last year .
159193:8	We must take heart from our experience in Hyde Park , we must nurture that support and build up the confidence of our members .
159193:39	We must take heart from our experience in Hyde Park , we must nurture that support and build up the confidence of our members .
159196:27	It wo n't be easy , but we must take the first steps now .
159200:39	It will be a debate , an argument and a fight we must win .
159238:9	And that must be the way we go ahead .
159299:50	Well , if they 're green , all I can say about us , that we must be cabbage-looking .
159302:9	Does it have to take another oil disaster like the Braer tanker , before Britain acts ?
159312:12	I do n't have to preach or tell our colleagues in England and Wales the effects water privatization 's had on them since nineteen eighty nine , they can see it for themselves every day .
159339:7	We have to end private monopolies .
159432:65	The qualification with respect to comp sixteen is that congress needs to be aware that a future Labour government will have to decide between many competing priorities .
159434:51	A Labour government , with the trade unions with them , using a progressive agenda , will clearly have to prioritize the demands that will be made upon it .
159492:9	And we have to ask the question .
159553:64	First to er , Peter 's point about er Gillian Sheppard , on the er , on the er Direct , I must say to you , I got a bit of a surprise when I saw Gillian Sheppard in such brazen er fashion on er on Direct , but you know , you 've quickly got answers in this organization , and somebody said ah well , it was meant to be an obituary to her and they were a bit perceptive in that er respect .
159652:7	I must give credit to one speaker though , an M P from Burnley .
159687:99	But I would n't wish anybody er to get the idea that we as a union wish to take away what really is the parliamentary privilege that members of parliament have got to have to look after their own constituencies in addition to being sponsored members of parliament .
159687:109	But I would n't wish anybody er to get the idea that we as a union wish to take away what really is the parliamentary privilege that members of parliament have got to have to look after their own constituencies in addition to being sponsored members of parliament .
159697:40	Now , I 've heard what the move move movers have had to say , and you did , I do n't need to tell conference that most of the business of running the country is actually done outside of the chamber itself , it 's done in the various committees I mean , Dennis Skinner was mentioned there .
159756:7	I have to say that if some of those born again modernizers had supported us then , we could have settled these issues long ago , and got on with the business of winning elections , which I thought was what party politics was about .
159802:49	Colleagues I 've had a message from the strikers at Crawley and they 've had to return .
159809:54	I know that some colleagues are aware of this but sadly recently passed away and I must by the colleagues in the Midland and East Coast region er to thank everybody who put into the er the collection on behalf of the .
159865:23	I heard what er John had to say yesterday about the Apex membership must accept the conditions of the merger .
159865:49	I heard what er John had to say yesterday about the Apex membership must accept the conditions of the merger .
159947:15	The members ' case must come first , otherwise everyone is gonna be put into the odds and sods section which is Apex , because it has n't got a subject such as public services or energy and utilities .
159966:28	In order that we can respond , we must organize ourselves , industry and by sector .
159967:22	That means making what might have to be some very difficult decisions affecting longstanding practices and even loyalties that have developed over many years .
160000:46	Now I ask you , do you think that a privatized network that has to pay a divided to investors will lead to a better , safer , cleaner , cheaper railway ?
160003:7	This has got to be immoral if not illegal !
160006:53	Congress , the vote in the House of Commons was lost unfortunately , but our sponsored MPs must ensure that the opposition in the House of Lords fights this ridiculous legislation as vigorously as possible , and we must support our brothers and sisters in B R with their fight .
160006:112	Congress , the vote in the House of Commons was lost unfortunately , but our sponsored MPs must ensure that the opposition in the House of Lords fights this ridiculous legislation as vigorously as possible , and we must support our brothers and sisters in B R with their fight .
160014:24	Even Tory MPs are against it and have to be whipped into line to get it through Parliament .
160052:54	As my comrade from Scotland says John Prescott has done a good job here , but I have to say it 's not up against very much .
160170:9	This government has got to be really be joking with its proposals for example the West Coast Line from north to south is estimated to require in the region of eight hundred million to cover track repairs and modernization as well as outdated rolling stock and signal replacements .
160171:14	All the speeds will have to be reduced for all rolling stock used on that line which will increase the cost for uses of the of that service .
160176:175	Another example is from region rail which is a totally independent system but over the years the five local authorities have ploughed millions of pounds of investment into improving a system , the stations the track and the rolling stock which in accordance with the Rail Bill will be put out of franchise next year but will anyone have to buy it ?
160215:64	In the mid eighties we decided that if we were going to be one of the super unions , we had to be amalgamation-friendly .
160253:15	Then of course you have to ensure that you can offer representation whenever it is needed , but most of all , we 've somehow got to create the feeling of lifetime loyalty to the trade union movement and to a particular trade union .
160310:149	Er , it 's something that will be welcomed by the trade union movement , a new forward , a new beginning to join once again the fruits of our labour with partnership with other unions and the Labour Party which was what we all need , but it must be done with careful planning and the brains at the top of the union must be telling the of the union , the members on the shop floor , the right direction in which to walk .
160310:192	Er , it 's something that will be welcomed by the trade union movement , a new forward , a new beginning to join once again the fruits of our labour with partnership with other unions and the Labour Party which was what we all need , but it must be done with careful planning and the brains at the top of the union must be telling the of the union , the members on the shop floor , the right direction in which to walk .
160320:28	And what a lovely place Portsmouth is I must say went to the gentlemen 's on , the toilet at the seafront last night and as I left , I looked at the sign that said er , please adjust your dress before you leave .
160335:66	Whatever the reasons for these changes , be they because of a hostile government , new technology or the European dimension , we must respond and change if we are to survive as a creditable organization .
160336:65	The employment situation described in the motion are no longer the exception , they are the rule and as such we must sharpen up our recruitment act .
160337:59	That is not to say we should adopt the hard sell or abandon our traditional value , but we must seriously examine how we can appeal to more desperate scattered membership .
160338:7	We must seriously examine how we can involve such membership in the decision making of the Union and carry them with us through change .
160339:7	We must seriously examine the relevance and method of delivery of our range of benefits .
160371:19	If we do , we must act quickly because our members in the Health Service , Local Authorities and all public services are in danger of being approached by the creation of UNISON .
160392:70	It 's only dirty tricks and underhanded tactics used by the T & G during the approach of the Workers ' Union so must realize Congress , to be more positive , one of the major benefits or more , the major benefit from future amalgamation with the T & G would be the free help of officials from both unions and and negotiations both national , regional and even at times individual company level where both unions help members .
160413:10	Comrades we must put to one side these kind of , this kind of fighting .
160414:7	We must I think look to go forward together .
160453:142	Erm here I 've got some formulae calculating production figures er we 've got different quarters formulae found are somewhat similar er there 's a so that I can copy one to any of the other adjacent cells outside will work I do n't have to edit the formula or do anything to it soon as I copy it , it 's alright for that cell .
160474:149	So for the majority of formulae that 's all you need to do to make the formulae copyable , so when I got this extra product to insert just insert the rows , copy the formula down and that change is made very quickly indeed , I do n't have to spend a lot of time understanding and editing the formulae .
160479:8	You must do all the inserts first and then copy down so that you end up with the right formula at the end of the day which is the C five , C eight .
160711:14	You would still have to save and retrieve the file to create the memory , but yes , that woul would be the idea of it .
160808:13	You do n't have to have a space , you can have anything you like .
160963:30	If you were putting form , you would n't have to .
161006:13	You do n't have to format something and put them in .
161055:28	Er , well draw a line , you do have to have an extra row put on it .
161096:27	Erm , but what , what do you have to do to chop it off ?
161541:13	You did n't have to press any buttons , it just did it .
161589:9	So you have to create a range name for each cell that you 're going to link .
161606:7	You have to bring the two separate cells into
161610:44	You ca n't link a whole range to a whole range , you can only have to one cell .
161611:90	So this a thing you wo n't like about it , is that if you 've got er , thirteen columns and ten rows , that means you have to create hundred and thirty range names , which you wo n't enjoy doing .
161663:94	Well , er , if you did , then if you were looking for something , you could n't find where it was , you know , you 'd have to delve in , and you take ages to find whatever you 're looking for .
161691:84	All that , all I can do is pick a file out of my come under One Two Three , but if you do that in Lotus you have to do the one two three first .
161696:33	Yeah , that 's what I mean , you have to do it on one two three .
161707:7	We have to go out
161712:24	You could do , but then you have to restart One Two Three and re-retrieve your spreadsheet and all the rest of it .
161716:104	if I do M D space put here , it will create a sub-directory , below the one two three directory , but if I want as a sub-directory from the roots directory , I have to type M D back-slash put .
161755:62	Erm , but then ev every time I wanted to retrieve a file from that directory , I 'd have to type in that put and the ninety three and all the rest of it .
161786:7	You have to type put every time .
161787:64	Not like saying , if you do this file directory , type the put in , then er , you would n't have to type put in every time you retrieve the file , from the directory .
161797:12	You do n't have to pick out the ones that are ninety three , cos th they 're all ninety three in that particular directory .
161825:12	You do n't have to retrieve any different files .
161837:10	It would have to begin D twenty two , and anything that follows erm suppose you wanted to delete all the nineteen eighty seven files .
161891:14	Er , so you have to resist that temptation .
161895:35	Before you can make changes to the system , you have to understand it , and that takes an awful long time .
161897:11	If you have to test an something , then there 's economy to scale if you test the ten things instead of one .
161907:10	I 'll have to investigate .
161911:7	You have to concentrate too on extremes , the first and the last in a row or a column .
161935:7	You have to test every single thing .
161942:66	Because if yo if you got to the end of testing and then you found an error , you might have to go all the way back to the beginning again , because what it affects affects something that you did earlier on , so you have to go back and test everything again .
161942:145	Because if yo if you got to the end of testing and then you found an error , you might have to go all the way back to the beginning again , because what it affects affects something that you did earlier on , so you have to go back and test everything again .
161943:65	But if you thought about the order that you test , then , if something does n't work , you may only have to go back a few steps and re-test .
161964:9	So you have to spend time or time to re-understand what you were doing before you can document it properly .
162001:72	Erm , even if you inherit some spreadsheets from this person that 's left , that 's useful knowledge because you do n't have to spend time searching for whoever might have created this spreadsheet .
162005:7	She had to stay here to midnight .
162021:44	So you have a list of procedures for erm , what you have to do , and this one will certainly be very useful to anyone else , who 's going to use the spreadsheet .
162032:42	In fact the whizzy-wig , whenever you use it , you do n't have to actually draw a diagram , that map that we just saw with boxes and arrows and things , you could draw that on the spreadsheet with the whizzy-wig .
162175:57	Yeah , when you retrieve it , does it update the file links automatically , or do you have to do something to make it update ?
162291:35	Oh , no that 's I guess I 'll just have to rephrase my question .
162583:61	But there there was n't , mm , well there was nothing that seemed immediately er relevant I must say , but
162689:14	is that you have to be accepted by the Home Office as well as the erm you know particular institution running the course .
162690:67	I d I do n't mean that 's er er a terribly difficult thing but it is just that that does have to happen .
162711:9	Cos they have to be very careful , especially with this abuse
162727:199	you know , in the one case you 're , you 're the representative of court the probation erm officer and they know that if they break the probation or you sort of erm do a bad report on them , maybe they 've got a suspended or something and they 'll , so you know there 's a , and , and you somehow have to handle that
162970:9	and they have to you know let their children get used to them and so on and
162987:16	I mean you have to watch things a bit , but you know basically it 's a good experience for them .
162991:22	Obviously some things they probably have to buy , shoes and
162996:29	I do n't know what they do about must have some sort of spending money , but
163000:24	and therefore that community 's going to have to look after him when he 's old .
163065:29	And you , but you , of course you have to take on something .
163073:19	I mean you may have to support them through a sort of bad patch , but the idea is to erm get them so that they can look after themselves , you know .
163076:56	But there is a lot of er sort of emotional interaction going on , and you 'll have to get used to that .
163092:21	Er I mean you obviously have to make erm decisions about that and so on .
163330:100	So in point of fact idioms is you 'll find that they always fit in either this slot or in this slot , but you wo n't find an idiom which has to form such that if you remove the subject and verb from a sentence you can stick the idiom in there and it will make sense .
163333:53	Well think about it I mean there might be one , in which case we have to do a little bit er dancing around
163363:37	What kind of items license them and where do they have to be in the sentence .
163425:7	We must have some like that .
163452:189	It just ca n't be , be the , I mean if you think of all the , I mean like say you 've got a , a , a sort of er cockney expression for if he 's got syphilis might be something like you know Johnny Rotten 's kissed him or something you know , there must be things like that , you know , there must be loads of things like that .
163452:222	It just ca n't be , be the , I mean if you think of all the , I mean like say you 've got a , a , a sort of er cockney expression for if he 's got syphilis might be something like you know Johnny Rotten 's kissed him or something you know , there must be things like that , you know , there must be loads of things like that .
163453:16	You know , there must be loads of things like that .
163467:52	It does really occur , I 'm sure if it does n't sound odd , it must occur
163492:91	It would be pointless it would be messy it would be inelegant and it would create the problem of the relations between the two , you 'd have to have transformations to get you from one to the other .
163502:79	One of the things the kid 's got to do learn his language sentence and in the context he can figure out what the sentence has to mean , like radical interpretation kid , the kid is sitting playing on the floor , a rabbit 's bounced by and the mother goes .
163527:56	Er , that 's I mean , I think if you really , in these cases you have to count them as different words just like I mean maths and physics does n't mean what maths used to mean in English .
163532:104	Nevertheless sometimes it clearly has and other times it clearly has n't , so there does seem to be a line there , even if we do n't yet know , we certainly have to draw it .
163534:62	Erm I do n't know if I mean remember that in order to do any compositional semantic theory , you have to assign structuring .
163535:117	Remember the little truth theory that we did in lecture two or three , or when you do semantics in logic by swinging two model theories , when you interpret the expressions of a logical language , you have to assign a structure and , er the claim here is just that the natural language , that structure , structure that the semantic interpretation rules apply to , it 's just the syntactic structure .
163549:16	then the other one still has to have the equivalent of a C commanding although it 's in a , in a different way .
163558:47	and er and the last I believe there was herself then er the middle item has got to be a particular type of item .
163567:15	So that you 'd have to
163568:19	you 'd , you 'd have to , well you do n't , you do n't because the thing is you want an asymmetrical relation between Florence and herself , because Florence or herself is okay and herself or Florence is n't .
163573:10	Well you have to
163574:7	you have to decide if that really is
163587:68	Anyway , he 's coming to the conference , so I dare say I 'll sit and hear what he has to say .
163654:20	Mm , I suppose they have to do it because of the computing erm , departments , has some equipment they want .
163665:27	The , the point as says , one has to bear in mind is that , okay , in general fostering are the successful parents , but the parents probably have more than one offspring .
163721:10	You 'd have to eat a lot more .
163799:30	They run away from the ducklings and the ducklings have to follow them , and chase them as it were , and the one that catches them , is the one they feed .
163830:23	This is the important point , you have to know it .
163836:21	However , the point you have to erm , recall , is that if it 's a conflict between parental investment in a sibling and parental investment in myself , I am twice as closely related to myself as I am to my sibling .
163898:11	So the sum has to be one , times a half , is greater than two , which it clearly is n't , cos one times a half is a half , and that is less than two .
163916:23	If erm , what would it have to be ?
163917:10	It would have to be at least , erm , what would it have to be , it would have to be at least the benefit , yes , the benefit would have to be at least four on the , on the B 's side , in order for that to work .
163917:44	It would have to be at least , erm , what would it have to be , it would have to be at least the benefit , yes , the benefit would have to be at least four on the , on the B 's side , in order for that to work .
163917:64	It would have to be at least , erm , what would it have to be , it would have to be at least the benefit , yes , the benefit would have to be at least four on the , on the B 's side , in order for that to work .
163917:101	It would have to be at least , erm , what would it have to be , it would have to be at least the benefit , yes , the benefit would have to be at least four on the , on the B 's side , in order for that to work .
163919:18	The fundamental point that you have to grasp is that parents want any transfers between their siblings that will result in a net gain for the , a , sorry , parents want any transfers between their offspring that result in a net gain for reproductive success .
163925:69	As mentioned , if you work it out for maternal erm for maternal cousins , for example the benefit turns out , has to be at least eight times .
163941:7	There has to be a reason why , all the male baboons who have got no particular self interest in , well there 's no obvious sign , in a fight between two youngsters , nevertheless he intervened to stop it , and he had realized that the reason , well he ultimately realized , development of parental investment , the reason they intervened to stop it , is that parents do not have the same self interest as their offspring do , when it comes to behaviour of offspring .
164017:34	And , of course , I mean , we have , have to remember , that when we talk about ageing altruism , this is just an abstraction .
164024:77	Er , I missed the train , the video thing would n't work when I showed my film lunchtime and er , the book that had to read , er , unfortunately , is not in the library , so er , the le let me explain the background to this .
164040:13	You 'll just have to put up with the printer chugging away .
164080:26	The disappointment with Wilson felt like Freud must have sort of lingered for quite a long time , cos it was not for eight years that he actually ventured on .
164123:7	It must be supplemented with the subject .
164184:40	And , er , the other problem with it is , you really have to know quite a lot about history , or biography to really to really get into .
164204:28	Yes , of course , erm the point has to be made , that Bullett , unlike contemporary erm , biographers of er Wilson , those people you mentioned , actually knew Wilson , and an you know , being his administration on that man as it were , and apparently Bullett had a lot a first-hand erm , biographical data , did n't he , according to the book ?
164211:101	And er , later of course , he became the American Ambassador of Vienna , so Freud met him , but so , so , Bullett had a personal stake in this , but I must admit , er my own view was , was rather to admire Bullett for his stand , because it 's a rare politician who stands up and says look , you know , we 've been there , having made promises , we 've broken all of them , and we ought to resign , or you ought to resign .
164226:33	So , Bullett and Freud conclude , well , it has to be something to do with him personally .
164230:71	Even though objectively , he had all the strength on his side , and if he 'd only stubbornly insisted , the allies would have had to accept the fourteen points , because there was no way that they just did n't have any erm , any clout really when when finally settled in peace .
164289:81	I mean , do n't ask me to explain it 's technical and so it 's a very technical matter of ego psychology that you must accept .
164319:14	And er , one has to admit , when you look at the literature of like , you know Gandhi , and and this kind of thing , and a lot of it 's psycho-history stuff .
164367:48	It was Jewish and so on , and because Einstein was Jewish and therefore he had to be more Jewish science and erm there was a book published called fifty against Einstein .
164394:7	That must be the , that must be the consensus
164394:22	That must be the , that must be the consensus
164503:15	I knew it had to be a gift from God .
164540:38	When Koresh himself came to Britain banned from New Bold he had to hold meetings in peoples homes .
164629:129	David established that erm in Isaiah , two twenty two , it says Seize Eve from man , and this is one of the prophecies that that David showed us that er shows the man , or the women , that they have to leave their wife or If it 's the woman , she has to leave her husband and her and her boyfriend and become his wife .
164629:168	David established that erm in Isaiah , two twenty two , it says Seize Eve from man , and this is one of the prophecies that that David showed us that er shows the man , or the women , that they have to leave their wife or If it 's the woman , she has to leave her husband and her and her boyfriend and become his wife .
164640:24	Even Koresh 's closest aide , Steve , had to give up his young wife Judy to the sinful Messiah .
164676:107	You see if There is going to be a war , and God 's people had also to be warriors and so there was that element of religion as well that that we had to be trained as warriors for the Lord .
164759:41	Is this because David Koresh had persuaded everybody that their lives would have to end in this siege ?
164781:12	They did n't have to do something .
164816:20	Why did all So many people have to die like this ?
164854:60	It 's a place you 'd be happy to leave , unless you 're a Garrimpero who must head back to work .
164930:39	The received no compensation , and all the expensive medical treatment they 've had to pay for themselves .
165018:71	As with the Garrimperos today , so great were the physical dangers of extracting gold , that the risk posed by mercury poisoning must have seemed derisory .
165042:9	So you have to show them that is very important , not because of the mercury recovery but because of their health .
165047:7	We have to work with the garrimperos we have to try and convince ' em .
165047:31	We have to work with the garrimperos we have to try and convince ' em .
165049:9	But we have to manage to find out how these people think , how we can convince them Even to protect themselves , one of the things we 'd like to show is look , using this mercury , you 're killing yourself .
165097:23	To get a caution they 'll have to admit their part in the crime but they wo n't have to go court .
165097:58	To get a caution they 'll have to admit their part in the crime but they wo n't have to go court .
165128:9	All he has to cope with is his own shame .
165162:7	You must have been very surprised that you were n't pro
165205:83	And I felt absolutely horrified , devastated to think that he could have done that sort of damage and just walked away he did n't even have to pay for the damage he 'd done .
165311:12	They do n't have to pay the the compensation , or make restitution in any way .
165345:9	But we must look at the long term view .
165428:9	Well that has to come out of their capital and as you can see it takes out quite a large chunk .
165453:21	To fill the seats you have to drop the fares , there 's a price war going on , especially in the markets that Virgin 's involved in , price wars mean very low fares , fares which in many cases will not cover the cost of flying the aeroplane .
165501:34	So to stay in the frame is Virgin going to have to get in there and
165502:28	Yes they are indeed , there going to have to compete on price as well as on service and value added .
165518:136	Inside , Virgin 's pilots are landing on runway twenty seven at Heathrow , in the simulator they can take off and land as often as they like at this the world 's busiest airport , but in real life Virgin says it has to fight for slots to take off and land at the times to suit business travellers , it blames B A. B A says it does n't allocate slots or monopolize Heathrow Airport .
165536:71	No , fortunately the other companies are stand alone companies erm making erm you know making their own way , and they do n't have to fear erm Richard coming and stripping them of their hard earned earnings to put into the airline erm because erm you know because fortunately we 've got resources elsewhere to look after the airline and see its development through .
165544:30	Neither Branson nor Virgin Atlantic as a private company , have to make such matters public .
165546:13	I would have had to pay tax unless I 'd set up trusts , er by setting up trusts I could then effectively delay paying the tax er use that money to invest in new companies .
165629:14	Now what we have to know is whether or not they are in fact getting these contracts because they are the best and the cheapest , or whether they are getting it because they have the best connections and they are paying the most money .
165634:13	What people have to keep in mind , and what people really should be very concerned about here in Great Britain is the fact that this is a very contentious industry , that there are a number of competitors out there who have taken to slinging innuendo around as if it were mud .
165669:17	We told that we had to do some preliminary research for possible television programmes .
165725:25	Under the act the holder of information has to disclose the type of information they hold , where they 've got it from , and who they intend to disclose it to .
165735:187	It is aimed either at the external hacker of which there are far fewer than press reports suggest or at the employee who though they have legitimate access legitimate lim limited access to a computer , nevertheless go beyond that authorization , but in order for the act to be successful , in order to get a successful prosecution , the prosecution have got to show that the access was unauthorized , and in the absence of clear codes of conduct , clear on-screen messages , that can be quite tricky .
165772:90	Everybody gets phone calls like that , unfortunately occasionally , but it kind of I went through a phase of it happening to me so I therefore had to change my phone number because it was er it was really unpleasant being woken er up by these calls .
165825:48	And to keep this sort of information confidential , those operating the P N C have to follow a detailed compliance manual .
165898:107	The implications for my daughter 's safety and security , and and mine and the rest of my family 's , because there have been a number of occasions over the years when I 've had to turn to the police because of my anxiety about that when there 's been a lot of attention from the media and when the press have published our address and so on erm and we 've had I 've had specific death threats particularly against my daughter on one occasion .
165922:101	Many companies , using only the most casual euphemisms , offer these services , so we spent a day on the phone talking to detective agencies listed in Yellow Pages , asking them what they had to offer .
165936:10	we would have to find out
165990:39	However , serious action to close the loopholes in the law will have to wait on the parliamentary timetable and the European legislation , until then , with more and more companies wanting to know the truth about their employees , competitors and suppliers , and with more and more information being put onto computers , the trade in personal data looks set to thrive .
166061:9	For I had to stay at home and look after me farm for .
166080:88	But as i told you before , when the council started preparing for Hitler , in when I went on the council work in nineteen thirty six I had to fill the ditches in there .
166085:32	It was the road was still there he had to do it and they were put there by the government .
166172:7	It must have been quite a spectacle though when the first combine came
166442:11	And then they had to walk .
166522:44	It was voted completely dray and the people who wanted to drink had to go to to Finstown .
166583:7	Stromness must have had a big temperance movement then .
166631:9	Well there must have been a lot of roads .
166764:13	But first they had to look for a camp site so Mr was the chief engineer I was employed by him , to have a look round and we discovered Lyness farm to be a suitable place .
167112:25	They had so many men they had to start at the other end and
167204:45	And the biggest job was keeping the water in the boiler and keeping the You had to get steam .
167250:10	Yes they had to get lights for for working .
167371:9	So you had to have an engine for each generator ?
167460:11	Because you had to put in the level plugs for them to keep the level and the centre lines to keep the centre .
167755:25	Oh yes oh yes certainly knew you had to know what you were doing with it you know .
167760:18	But after that you just had to do it yourselves .
167840:10	Yeah that must have been quite something to see something chugging round Hoy
167851:9	Aye I must ask you once you once you had your sort of main tunnels built and your light and then you would start concentrating on your chambers ?
167876:31	No there 'd be there 'd be about It must be two hundred feet above .
167986:15	I think it must have been indeed .
167988:37	They are oh I do n't ken when but they must you ken obviously a long time ago story .
168030:33	They got him in the boat and they he had to lie down in the bottom of the boat and they and they covered him with a tarpaulin .
168046:14	And he did n't have to part with his cattle after all .
168179:38	The the last time that it happened was er on it must be maybe twenty year ago or so .
168192:7	And must have been the ghost .
168266:44	Or the protective that we have now , and they would have sometimes have to weigh the whole .
168297:7	It must have been awful bad in the hens
168312:44	they 'd take a piece with them and that was all they had to sustain them the whole day .
168406:9	Did you have to have a different pinny every day then ?
168422:10	Well it must have been an awful job to keep all these white ?
168432:22	What sort of things did they have to keep their waists in ?
168437:9	Did they have to keep that on all day ?
168441:16	Did did they have to wear lots of Do you remember your aunties or your your mother Did they have to lots of layers of clothes or they seem to be .
168441:64	Did did they have to wear lots of Do you remember your aunties or your your mother Did they have to lots of layers of clothes or they seem to be .
168468:11	And did they have to stop and change the horses ?
168494:8	it must have poured on us but I ca n't ever remember it raining You know there was when we used to go to Deerness I had very long hair and we And Kirkwall was n't just the cleanest of place at places at that time .
168498:111	And er when I went to school , Miss the old teacher , she used to take me out , er I used to go to the school ready to go to Deerness , we had to ask out a quarter of an hour early .
168500:13	And er I had to ask out this quarter of an hour early , well I got me hair all combed out all ready to go you see ?
168561:17	So I mean you had to sort of come up , and grab a breath , and go under the water and try and swim away from it .
168562:45	Which in the sea was pretty futile really , I mean you just had to go where the sea took you .
168601:130	Well I mean I ca n't say enough for the people in the Aberdeen Royal Infirmary , I mean they 've got a great burns unit there and I mean er er I think the plastic surgeons and what knot are about they must be some of the best in the world .
168605:44	Obviously with that number of weeks that you were in hospital , it must have given you plenty of time too , to think about future prospects in a fairly dangerous industry in the North Sea .
168623:27	So I mean it goes down to must be something like equipment failure which is something that nobody can really allow for .
168646:185	It 's hard hard to say how much that would have helped the situation out there I mean it definitely would have helped in some degree , but I mean there was still all the oil that was present on the platform in the separators except those which were left under pressure all that would have had to burn .
168654:27	Looking back on that then , you must have lost a great number of colleagues and workmates that it must give you sort of mixed feelings looking back on it ?
168654:63	Looking back on that then , you must have lost a great number of colleagues and workmates that it must give you sort of mixed feelings looking back on it ?
168659:84	Obviously having such a a close brush with death is something that you you 've you 've obviously lived through and be something that er you must feel strongly about .
168677:55	I said that the Occidental are gonna They 'll either willingly pay or they 're going have to pay a lot of compensation to the bereaved and er fund more or less just going to top up any money when it 's probably not going to be necessary in the long run .
168687:106	They say that I mean any changes any in temperature are very noticeable so w Like it is working in the middle of winter offshore would be something I would have to come to terms with but no I mean I do n't think there 's any problems work-wise .
168740:12	Och well you have to shift with the times , and the new boat which is much faster will be a great help .
168797:60	I spoke later to Jackie , lifeboat secretary , and asked him how many of a crew he had to call on at any time .
168800:42	There 's a great family tradition , obviously , in Longhope as there must be in every Orkney and Shetland lifeboat .
168807:42	Was ashore in a cleft among the rocks there and the the lifeboat had to turn in a position that was just about twice her own length .
168870:55	You wo n't get a prize unless you 're up to it , The er the ploughing has to look professional .
168871:7	It has to resemble the real thing as done in the fields .
168890:11	And does it have to be young people resident in South Ronaldsay , or is it more of an open contest now ?
168897:9	So we have to hope for a fine day for this on Sunday , obviously .
168920:53	But the only difference that I see was that they pushed their ploughs there , so they must have been smaller than the ones we use .
168948:33	I do n't know why it stopped , they had to get out of it you see ?
168954:9	And you had to plough that within a certain time .
168955:35	I think it was two hours for me I had to plough that one .
168962:9	But you had to win it twice before it became your own property .
168988:9	One plant had to get light for eight hours per day and the other one had to get light for sixteen hours a day , so another wheel at this end did this job when this went around so many times .
168988:50	One plant had to get light for eight hours per day and the other one had to get light for sixteen hours a day , so another wheel at this end did this job when this went around so many times .
169000:10	We 'll have to have to get a few of these in Radio Orkney I can see .
169000:17	We 'll have to have to get a few of these in Radio Orkney I can see .
169040:86	Yes , well , it 's at at an odd angle , you noticed th that because we are in latitude fifty nine , so the centre of this has to look at the pole star .
169042:15	And er this th has to be thirty one degrees to the level , so that er you follow the stars as they travel around the sky , because they 're always highest in the south and like the sun and the moon they 're always highest when they 're due south .
169127:12	Oh well it must be my before I was a teenager .
169138:15	And of course I had to get another lens , a piece of glass about the same size , in order to grind it , because you grind the glass with another piece of glass with a grit in between .
169182:10	Anyway I had to photograph the man , I photographed the cow and I had to photograph a background .
169182:47	Anyway I had to photograph the man , I photographed the cow and I had to photograph a background .
169183:9	And I had to merge all these pictures together .
169184:22	It looks very convincing I must say , it just looks like a farmer
169187:37	feet of the cow was not in the original photograph so I had to go up to a a farm and ask for straw to hide the
169213:21	to me up there , I must admit Sandy ?
169228:49	So I was still in Berry then and working at the grammar school , so we had to walk across all three causeways for some time .
169299:57	Stooks would blow down and be set up to blow over again and wet heavy sheaves might have to be stoked over and over again .
169342:10	I 'd have to stay in Holyhead for a few nights .
169348:7	They had to walk to Valley Station to the train unless their people could afford to buy them bicycles .
169435:47	And I left Rhos-y-Bol when I retired because I felt I they 'd have to have another nurse there , and you see the other nurse would never be able to enjoy the They would always be running to me a and it would n't be fair to another nurse .
169452:49	And I would n't like a child of mine and I managed just two I had to send to the workhouse and a mother and baby died there , it was a bad case you see .
169460:54	Well in those days everybody was afraid and erm oh it was a blow if anybody had to go to the Valley .
169506:9	Well they had to fetch me .
169507:7	They had to come see .
169513:7	They had to come , give me my messages you see .
169516:17	Then er the county then had to give us telephones .
169518:24	What was the prelavent case you had to treat ?
169523:40	It was the babies you see that they were Well you had to have the doctor to you .
169524:10	I only had to call Mr once .
169554:9	And I had to pay my rooms out of that .
169664:36	But if they had a doctor you see , they 'd have to pay a pound .
169770:47	And erm my father and another lad who was working out in the had to go Called Michael , had to go down every evening to pump water for the the animal .
169770:67	And erm my father and another lad who was working out in the had to go Called Michael , had to go down every evening to pump water for the the animal .
169772:9	Then they had to go and pump water for the stock .
169774:102	And erm my father and Michael had got to know the maids in in the Plas but Michael had grabbed the the the the good looking of the parlour maid and my father had to make do with the cook .
169860:27	And she had a custom she we had to have a book called observation book .
169861:42	None of us had any idea what observation meant , but we had to write down a sentence or something we had noticed on our way to school .
169869:13	And er I had to fall back very often just write , I saw Mr follow the horse in in in that that churning power .
169870:7	I had to fall back on that many time .
169905:7	You had to go sit scholarship to go to the county school we call they called it .
169951:7	We had to carry in in Winter we had the rainwater off the roofs which filled two brick cisterns for the livestock .
169952:26	But in Summer those were dry we had to carry all the water then .
169962:35	And then she put had some warm water and er she had to have it to the proper consistency and then she 'd have a a bucket of water w standing by her side with a a jug .
169963:42	And once she 'd had the her arms in the dough , I had to stand by her side just to feed a drop of water gently .
169986:31	And making a load of hay especially , you had to work it , roll every pitchfork you had , roll it and set it properly so that you knew as you now then you must have numbers on them so you know how to unravel that lot .
169986:109	And making a load of hay especially , you had to work it , roll every pitchfork you had , roll it and set it properly so that you knew as you now then you must have numbers on them so you know how to unravel that lot .
169987:11	Every erm pitchfork must come out one You ca n't start fighting and and pulling it against the grain otherwise you you would be in trouble .
170049:81	Erm remember the hay we would be turning it w with pitchforks you know , and erm not a well goo drying day but you had to risk turning it and hoping that it 'd be dry but er it would be raining again the following day .
170050:30	Yes I 've seen hay spoilt but you had to make do with it .
170063:14	And another job we had to do erm especially on a rainy day , ready for the worst .
170064:33	Er we had no hay barn then , then you had to thatch the the stacks .
170065:9	And you had to make what we called straw .
170094:28	Well to keep his rope tight , I had to pull on the other , and the other chap would jerk me back .
170102:27	It used to heat so then you had to give it time to cool and settle down .
170152:28	Was there ever any time when you just had to accept the fact that the hay would have to be carried in wet ?
170152:55	Was there ever any time when you just had to accept the fact that the hay would have to be carried in wet ?
170197:11	Well the horses had to work hard .
170214:35	Erm and it was rather a a and heavy work , you had to have a team of horses to pull a load of suedes and you had to get them in Some you used to to carry out on and just drag them I mean s spread them out on the field er for the store cattle and the sheep .
170214:83	Erm and it was rather a a and heavy work , you had to have a team of horses to pull a load of suedes and you had to get them in Some you used to to carry out on and just drag them I mean s spread them out on the field er for the store cattle and the sheep .
170215:9	Then you had to bring some into the yard which were put through the scrapper for the dairy cows and the young calves that were housed .
170233:29	And for the for the young calves you had to scrap them cos they could n't eat the the the big big thick sl slices for the young calves .
170236:130	And then you you used to have a blow lamp to heat it up and after that you you erm put it on half compression and you were turning one of the big flywheels round until it it started and you had to keep the blowlamp on it .
170240:48	But er with the the the er the original the the first one , you had to heat it up with a blowlamp and you had to be very very careful to get it just to the right heat , before if you tried to start it too cold , it would kick back and if was too hot again , it just would n't start .
170240:81	But er with the the the er the original the the first one , you had to heat it up with a blowlamp and you had to be very very careful to get it just to the right heat , before if you tried to start it too cold , it would kick back and if was too hot again , it just would n't start .
170257:12	Well , you had to feed it you know erm Then there was this erm er sort of a whipping in in there was a long trough leading to to the knife and then there were some cogwheels which pulled it into the knife .
170268:70	But there were some people you know on a smallish farm , they did n't have an oil engine , then they would have to turn the scrapper by hand .
170309:34	Then that would sort of feed itself , but you had to have one man feeding the the scrapping machine and another man with a shovel , pulling away the the the the the the scrapped at the side and then you had to have another man feeding the long hay into the chaff cutter .
170309:123	Then that would sort of feed itself , but you had to have one man feeding the the scrapping machine and another man with a shovel , pulling away the the the the the the scrapped at the side and then you had to have another man feeding the long hay into the chaff cutter .
170317:42	A lot of labour yes but that was far far better than to have to turn them by hand you know .
170379:13	So she 'd have to face the prospect of me being on the dole for a long time .
170417:15	I felt I had to I When I went to school m my father could n't afford very much and erm I remember starting the first term of first day of the term with shoes with a big split in it .
170423:58	So consequently at times there would be er periods of stress for myself , where I just had to get enough money to give my daughter some new clothes like you know .
170476:21	But myself , I 'd have had to send my daughter to school on m more than one occasion with a tatty uniform .
170502:14	Erm so you have to get work fairly quickly .
170551:23	And he knew I did n't have to be home for the kids or whatever , he knew my circumstances so well and he knew th exactly how much he could use me you know .
170571:15	Yeah , we 've had to sell things now and again .
170578:10	We 've had to .
170603:31	But we knew that also that erm if it had to go , I t had to go .
170603:50	But we knew that also that erm if it had to go , I t had to go .
170607:86	I suppose we could have pushed ourselves and got these things , but I think we both knew that erm if we did , we 'd probably have to sell them halfway through paying for them .
170612:60	When er when the time came that you decided that er y you and your tape recorders whatever , had to part company , how do you how would you go about trying to get the best price for them ?
170616:109	So all you 'd do is you 'd cast about for a friend , you 'd decide on a price that you would accept and if it was a friend , if you had to sell it and you needed fifteen quid to buy a pair of shoes or whatever , erm and you 'd like twenty , you 'd turn to a mate and go , Have you got twenty quid ? and he he 'd say yes or no .
170630:81	So I could n't I could n't charge him twenty cos he 'd only charged me he 'd only charged me twenty so I had to sell him back to him for a tenner you know .
170662:18	I mean if you had to take it along to a shop and
170675:20	Erm when you er had to stock up again wh wh h h how would you do that ?
170708:7	You have to be careful where you 're taking it and all the rest of it .
170721:7	He had to let one go so he was in the shop a lot himself .
170821:111	What I what I 'd really hope for is to be able to do it without having to go to college and just do it by experience but that 's I 'd have to be awful awful good .
170879:10	We 've had to cancel five classes that we set up erm in November .
170880:18	Five different classes we had to cancel because nobody turned up .
170981:13	You you 'd have to be very er very hard line for me to notice it .
170983:13	Yeah I 'll have to go .
171020:13	However they have had to prove their worth for online transaction processing .
171075:64	One is the performance aspect because every time we need to access the relational database across the network we have to send a large piece of transactional logic , a piece of S Q L code , across the network , and that could be significant in size .
171080:35	But the S Q L code which is sent to it has to be interpreted when it gets to the server machine , and we all know the difference between compiled and interpreted code .
171082:88	If we decide to change the way we do business or change the way the application works on how it models our environment , then we have to revisit using this architecture every single client machine on the network and upgrade that particular business function .
171229:100	Using single devices be they terminals or erm perhaps Microsoft Windows in the future we 'll need to categor deal with the different categories of users and the different devices they have to deal with .
171241:22	In fantasy land if we ever have to replace our systems we can of course simple switch off the old one and switch on the new one .
171254:13	Of course I have to say that er software fails as well sometimes and indeed one of the problems we all have is that with today 's hardware technologies some of the er computers are so fast that it really reaches the bugs rather quicker .
171259:10	You only have to look back over what 's er happened over the last few years in terms of for example O S Two , Microsoft Windows , a variety of Unix , and you 'll see that technologies will come along and however sound a decision you make at one point in time the market circumstances and potentially mean that what was right for you then not the right .
171260:21	This is the world we have to live with and find a way .
171269:74	So we need to build our systems to meet the requirements we have today because we could n't justify more and yet we have to build in the scale scaleability so that systems can grow to meet the growing requirements which are almost inevitable .
171275:9	The systems have got to deliver data reliably otherwise they 're not of any value at all and yet they 're going to have to deal with unpredictable events such as network failure , software failures , hardware failures , user failures or whatever .
171275:77	The systems have got to deliver data reliably otherwise they 're not of any value at all and yet they 're going to have to deal with unpredictable events such as network failure , software failures , hardware failures , user failures or whatever .
171298:47	But we were conscious that an accounting system maintains the corporate financial information and we must protect the integrity of that information .
171299:9	So we must transcend those erm opportunities for security within Unix and ensure that our application will maintain the integrity of data within the system .
171314:13	On documents we must bear in mind with the development of any system that we should support true electronic data interchange .
171354:68	In the U K we seem to keep the equipment for twenty years and then complain if it goes wrong before we have to throw it away .
171377:119	We are aware that we can control the method of access by users though our application , but there are other tools they are using in in the company to access the corporate relational database and your database controller must be aware of those tools and implement the same controls on those views of that information within the database .
171382:7	We must for example be able to use concurrent users of the same accounting information in many different languages .
171521:17	In the real world we have to recognize that we cannot convert customers to only use the database .
171522:7	We must be able to provide a level of transparency that shields users and the programmers from not only where the data is stored but in which relational database management system .
171525:62	All the clients on the network are programmed using a single dialect of S Q L so our programmers no longer have to know the nuances and differences between each of the proprietary extensions of the SQL of each database they 're programming against .
171572:35	And traditionally these three types of delivery mechanism mean we have to rewrite or recode applications in their entirety for each type of device .
171665:36	open systems in the Unix context erm what plans do you have to integrate with N T as and when it becomes available ?
171893:9	Then we had to shoot them do you see .
171987:31	And up in the cellar , after the shooting , we had to make them to a brace like that , a cockerel and a hen .
171991:18	And the following day , we had to go in and help and pack them in hampers .
172040:11	And then you had to be quick at it you know .
172043:9	And you had to be quick you see , because the birds sometimes used to come and stop over .
172072:7	They had to go through a lot of blocks .
172279:9	So we had to as soon as they come we had to open a trench and heel them in do you see .
172279:37	So we had to as soon as they come we had to open a trench and heel them in do you see .
172313:14	Well now then you had to get different spaces for to here .
172333:7	You had to be very .
172377:40	, this er fellow that was for in Conway told me we had to keep an extra erm for Douglas fir he says .
172417:30	And erm so really three times a day I had to er make tea .
172435:7	They had to make and shape things for us well for for the fitters , the machine and that you know .
172455:56	Some of them were kept really busy just er looking after the brakes and and they they had to er check the er the erm hooks .
172458:151	And that that came round er I mean they were stamped and er the turn you know the each I I do n't I do n't remember what what they were examined , but er th you know the the that was the law that they had to be .
172505:106	He 'd been er had an accident in the quarry some time ago and he was working in the helping as a mate or something in the carpenter 's shop and he he must have been h must have had his hands in our pile of finished products and er Well partly finished products and er he er he was caught one of the cos er these castings there was a an edge to them you know , the joint of the the mould that came together sort of thing .
172505:122	He 'd been er had an accident in the quarry some time ago and he was working in the helping as a mate or something in the carpenter 's shop and he he must have been h must have had his hands in our pile of finished products and er Well partly finished products and er he er he was caught one of the cos er these castings there was a an edge to them you know , the joint of the the mould that came together sort of thing .
172506:7	They had to be filed clean .
172518:9	And they had to be the bearings had to be either you had to have a s a set ready at all times sort of thing you know so a spare set .
172518:24	And they had to be the bearings had to be either you had to have a s a set ready at all times sort of thing you know so a spare set .
172518:41	And they had to be the bearings had to be either you had to have a s a set ready at all times sort of thing you know so a spare set .
172520:107	They used to cost about two hundred pounds in those days and that was a heck of a sum in those days you know that sort of thing , how much they cost and had to be careful of them and all that .
172534:79	And erm the He made a boring bath so that the whole block it it was a massive thing you know , that that that had to be .
172610:64	They used to blast , first blasting at nine o' clock , throughout the quarry you see so everybody had to go in so that was an excuse for a break .
172617:56	I remember we I had this sort of enamel brown enamel jug , ooh it was mm must have been somewhere about four .
172637:17	Out of that I had to find , threepence a day erm bus fare .
172642:40	And er I think after and when I became sixteen that er had to start paying your your m paying the union I had to join the union as a junior member you know .
172642:76	And er I think after and when I became sixteen that er had to start paying your your m paying the union I had to join the union as a junior member you know .
172649:34	And er wash the cups and And he used to have to go running er down with messages down to or down to the head office rather that we had an office in where where our fitting shop was where there was a draughtsman 's office .
172654:15	And this cook had to go down and carry messages back and forth and all that was his job as cook .
172671:50	But erm and then at during er before lunch and all that I used to have to go take a bucket and go to the smithy and erm as you may know , there 's a a cooling er tank beside in the in er beside every every every erm blacksmith 's fire and er you know to bo keep the er no t no to keep the nozzle of the
172698:88	Erm I mean the one could very easily have have got er some form of dermatitis with all the you know various oils and stuff that we had to put our hands in .
172785:45	Well As I told you to begin with , he he he he must he was a man was er years ahead of his tim really .
172795:7	They had to give it a quarter turn you see with a spanner .
172889:14	But anyway I did have to do some of them .
172891:8	I had to keep the fire going for example and I had to go and get er some e Eccles cakes for Uncle Jonathan for his tea .
172891:39	I had to keep the fire going for example and I had to go and get er some e Eccles cakes for Uncle Jonathan for his tea .
172932:16	So then er and I had to do with the antique .
172961:15	Now you did n't have to copy everything , but Uncle Jonathan was very meticulous and anything that there would be any debate on , or any discussion on , he always made a copy and it was my job to do this without smearing it .
172971:10	And you had to be careful and you had to keep your hands clean .
172971:29	And you had to be careful and you had to keep your hands clean .
172974:28	That was my job so therefore my hands had to be constantly clean and that 's not easy for a seventeen year old to keep his hands clean all the time but I had to .
172974:101	That was my job so therefore my hands had to be constantly clean and that 's not easy for a seventeen year old to keep his hands clean all the time but I had to .
172975:67	And if you did smear it , there was all hell to pay because then , Margaret , your cousin , would have to retype it .
173014:12	So naturally I had to get it with and it was heavier th I do n't know how much it weighed , I I I got it by the way , in my barn in farm in Indiana , one of the last relics of Brothers .
173015:10	And I had to put it on the seat of my bicycle , push it all the way and it 'd be a good mile from Street to right across from .
173018:12	And and I had to pay for it of course .
173019:35	Now I was making ten shillings a week , and I had to pay a penny toll every day to come to from office .
173020:11	And then I had to pay tuppence in cafe for a cup of tea and mother would fix me a sandwich .
173023:10	Anyway I had to push this thing and had to wait for it .
173023:28	Anyway I had to push this thing and had to wait for it .
173046:75	And then you were talking about San Francisco earlier , now there are some churches in San Francisco that had Welsh slate and it must have gone by sea all the way
173065:47	Because the governor 's palace was in a state of very sad repair and they had to put a new roof in it .
173090:8	We had to but the slates , we had to er g get the right dimensions , the right thickness and all that stuff .
173090:28	We had to but the slates , we had to er g get the right dimensions , the right thickness and all that stuff .
173096:9	So it must be in the records somewhere .
173201:48	and I found that you do not address an architect as Mr Jones , it must be Edward T Jones Esquire .
173227:30	Then he said , the Bishop of Bangor will have to sue you .
173245:11	Because they had to keep him there for so damn long in this inquiry er the senate inquiry and all the stuff on the Lusitania .
173252:58	maybe it was the battle of the Somme , I do n't remember , but I remember I had to go carrying the basket , and mother would go and call on these poor people who had lost their their families .
173353:33	So anyway , erm they met me and Bert had to go back to his office and Will said he had to go back to his office , but he said , What would you like to do ?
173353:68	So anyway , erm they met me and Bert had to go back to his office and Will said he had to go back to his office , but he said , What would you like to do ?
173384:43	Girls with silk stockings and and the girls in in er Wales I must say , and even in Liverpool in those days , used to wear stockings .
173453:43	Wh when you started working as a lad , erm what did you have to do ?
173466:20	Fourth of August so we had to go see .
173468:13	And then we had to go straight away there and we went different places , Northampton , s you know different places in the country like , in England .
173471:9	And we had to go to France then .
173538:7	I have to I h I when I get to the office , I 'll h I 'll h I 'll have a look a bit closer .
173674:7	You had to store them .
173720:11	Fourth I had to go from here .
173723:53	I thought I used to I used to say to her sometimes I 'll have to go off story .
173826:44	Yes well from as many boys that had seen the age , they had to go .
173833:77	In a house facing there and her son was one of then Caernarfon er what do you call them er militia like and they had to go talking with me and a little One of the first little motor cars like this .
174024:73	Everybody w looking but when my father and all was there , there was nine then so there was more so we had to go in th in that big room there and eat off the table there then .
174057:7	It must have been a bit of a shock to her .
174094:7	We had to go up heights then did n't we .
174107:12	And he 'd have to put that I remember one man that was counting like this , he used to count them by the three you know .
174168:8	He had to and sick , he was vomiting see .
174256:9	Well I had to replace a s er two slates on on my roof .
174321:9	Did you have to travel from your home here in Llandudno to Dolgarrog to your work or did you ?
174338:166	That was until the grid got into proper operation and the then they got nationalized then they they transferred back onto A C. It was to bring it into line to s to keep the town supplied through all the er cables that were were being constructed for D C. They had to bring the A C back to D C. That was converters .
174524:23	It 's a public service that must be kept going .
174760:22	Will you excuse me I 'll have to go can you take that off ?
174801:15	How much did you have to pay to go in ?
174849:28	And then when my wife died and I had to sell all you know it disa er I think er it got away with er some old stuff you know .
174865:26	And I back up the line I had to go .
174919:23	Er on these sections when they have to er rejoin up after being away you see .
174952:52	And the er there 's there 's er one one of them two of them had to close down .
174954:50	You see there 's there 's the baptists in er Street , that that had to close to make way for er for all that shopping area , Boots and whatnot .
175085:31	Neil Doughty eleven to two , Bradbury Star that has to be the favourite easing slightly this seven to one with General Idea .
175097:24	He would be my pick I must say , of them He 's he 's
175103:118	Erm another I know er I 've spoken to Deckland Murphy as well being the Newmarket 's jumps jockey and erm they think he 's the Gold Cup horse well if he is he 's gonna have to put in a good performance today then I 'd stick with him .
175115:62	and lighter weight as well last year and has more weight today so he 's had he would have had to have improved about four or five pounds to win today ?
175308:28	as well over here that our our guys have to cope with .
175311:53	There 's nothing like an Epsom , there 's nothing like the variety that our jockeys have to cope with
175456:9	But there must have been a Palace revolution at half time .
175470:54	The ref said the first time the ball was n't on the spot properly so the kick had to be retaken .
175524:37	It would be nice to think that we do n't have to consider this , we did n't have to have meetings with our local police to decide what we 're going to do on the day of the match in case there is trouble .
175524:62	It would be nice to think that we do n't have to consider this , we did n't have to have meetings with our local police to decide what we 're going to do on the day of the match in case there is trouble .
175578:71	There is a violent undercurrent in our society which has got nothing at all to do with football and where football must n't be complacent is to provide the opportunities at its matches to allow that undercurrent of violence to manifest itself .
175580:26	Football clubs , football supporters er and parliaments have got to talk between themselves to try and come up with a solution .
175607:33	Usually in the Labour party any other organization you 're gonna have to wait a year but the women did n't .
175623:15	I think we have to face up to the fact in the Labour party that quotas , that positive discrimination are essentially clumsy .
175630:31	It was a backlash against quotas where you have got to vote for a certain number .
175645:23	I 'm afraid there we must leave it but perhaps that is the way forward .
175652:7	You have to go back a very long way indeed to a more decorous age when politicians did n't use the memoir as a weapon for reopening old wounds .
175657:36	So it 's not a progression all in one way but I have to say that even by the standards of the Lloyd George era , the battle by memoir which we now see for considerable sums of money has become more than a cottage industry , it 's a production line industry .
175666:10	Now I have to be careful what I say about Lady Thatcher 's because of the laws of libel and also I do n't know who 's written which pieces but it 's known she 's had help you see .
175750:11	He 's had to have his spleen out , his spleen has burst inside him .
175793:53	Mining unions who 've been told even more pits may soon close say the government must do more to secure orders .
175906:12	And he only had to wait a couple of erm points left on his licence so if I 'd taken the dangerous thriving or something he could have lost his licence but erm that 's besides the point .
175999:45	Er you know while you 're working er there was no you had to stop him sometimes because he 'd kill himself ha ha that 's it .
176015:69	As they say erm whether they were thinking , Well we will starve them on the gate out and they 'll have to come back , that 's another situation but erm I never thought we 'd have so much support from people and we can still erm I mean I 'd rather be back at work but erm that is the situation .
176046:44	So when I tackled Mr about it he said , Oh we must maintain our customers .
176068:9	So I had to make the speech best as I could and it went down all right I think .
176069:13	Erm then we had to call on the way back in Deeside er in Mold and there was a miner 's support group there .
176090:177	Well then er quite , so he said erm it was all quiet and I looked up into the darkness and I said that the old fellow had gone and he litten his fuse and there was me there I could see the sparks in the darkness and I was way twenty feet below him and he must have whatsit .
176091:17	So I said I had to make a quick decision either I was going to go up me chain past his whatsit and into the roof , or else go thirty feet down and run right across the chamber into whichever er level they could go to .
176097:27	And er he was there er two blokes had to get come get chains and get him out of it and all that and here was n't a scratch on him but erm he was off for about five or six months you know he had ee ee this brain tests and everything , the shock had er he was quite bad for some time .
176104:24	Oh he said , You do n't have to send er professional speaker or anything just somebody to have a chat with ya .
176144:100	Erm and I 've said further on that erm some could have afford to stay out but that 's they we 're not all built the same and erm we must avoid that at all cost .
176163:31	The help wo n't stop like overnight , we must keep going .
176203:9	And we must have caught it from there .
176204:27	Because er my mother was fair and she must have carried it or something and then I I 'd just started I think a week of two or three weeks and my sister got it and the boys never got it .
176213:60	So they were joining them , they came over The Texas sister came over for twelve months and they must have persuaded them to go back or something .
176251:42	Well so I went and then they came on the Friday night it must have been the twenty twenty fifth of July ninete nineteen thirty .
176321:14	And everybody , you had to keep to suit every customer if you wanted to make a business .
176322:7	You had to do that .
176323:34	Or do without is n't it you know , you had to stock for the sake of getting the business .
176457:9	And I had to get a box and many a time I 've fallen on my back from that so Cos somebody had moved the boxes I think .
176466:51	And er I dunno it went from that and and I 'm sorry I I had to leave it really .
176537:31	And I suppose she had money there , must have been .
176549:34	So we paid that because they wanted and then we had to pay for stock .
176551:14	All rubbish , we had to throw it .
176552:37	But I paid about four hundred for it Oh but you had to if you wanted it .
176565:34	Well er it would in a way because you 'd have to pay interest on what you were borrowing would n't you ?
176567:13	Oh yes you have to pay now a mortgage wo n't you .
176568:7	You have to pay interest on what you b you borrow now .
176598:43	But you see , the more money they had , the more they had to share I suppose with M
176640:6	And had to settle home .
176647:7	They had to ask if they wanted .
176671:14	But they did n't have to .
176723:34	You know I get things now , I just have to throw them some of them .
176810:15	I l I had to do the other jobs as I know , but I used to like serving people because I used to like meeting people and sort of study people .
176839:28	We had a wholesalers of course we had to get wholesalers for some things .
176877:29	Ready for the season so that I would n't have to buy a lot of things when you were busy .
176942:68	Oh yes , you got to know th That 's one thing in business that 's one thing you have to do .
176944:11	That you have to find your way with people .
176995:10	They only had to be with you .
177034:27	Floors done and everything , we did n't have to do jobs as like that in the morning .
177082:11	The Labour Party must continue to reject the tax on the low paid , the young , the elderly , and needs to commit itself to a restoration of the Wages Councils , an increase in the power of the Wages Councils , and an improvement in the Wages Inspectorate , to ensure that all employers who break the minimum wages legislation be detected and prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law .
177097:7	We must recognize this policy for what it is , to turn Britain into the sweatshop of Europe .
177110:36	Although more women are j t joining trade unions , they have to continue to work in places where their bosses are opposed to union membership .
177116:7	We must support the introduction of a minimum wage and fight against the abolition of Wages Councils .
177150:8	Employers must simply abandon the national agreement altogether , or the employers may simply ban the national agreement altogether , as has happened in other industries like cotton spinning and weaving .
177194:20	Nearly one million people have now had to claim mean-tested benefits in order to top up low pay .
177241:7	We must continue to campaign on this issue and support taking legal action in Europe against the attack on women 's pay .
177313:47	But , in order to maintain the services to our members , unions will probably still have to increase rates at an annual basis .
177319:60	We demand that they defend our interests , both in Westminster and Eur European Parl Parliament , but we must realize that until the electorate of this country vote in a Labour government , as I am sure they will do in the near future , no later , we will have a w workplace campaigns , we 'll have workplace campaigns to educate and inform our members .
177439:11	But actual stories must be balanced and if not , the correction has to be the same , must have the same prominence in the original , as the original , article .
177439:39	But actual stories must be balanced and if not , the correction has to be the same , must have the same prominence in the original , as the original , article .
177439:56	But actual stories must be balanced and if not , the correction has to be the same , must have the same prominence in the original , as the original , article .
177449:7	We must demand that these laws be abolished because if this government has its way , the working man will have gone back one hundred years .
177462:7	We must start to fight back now and the G M B should be at the for forefront .
177466:39	I believe , brothers and sisters , at this Conference , we must decide whether we 're gonna take away from here back to our members any credibility .
177468:172	As a works convenor , I work along twenty shop stewards , and I can tell this Congress that the message that they 've given to me from the people from the people that have elected them , is that they 're sick and tired of the perpetual bleating of the T U C about how they have to abide by the laws , when the only laws that are there are the laws that are bringing this movement down .
177471:42	Brothers and sisters , I say to you that the message that must leave this Conference is one that says to all trade unionists , we will fight any oppressive legislation used against us .
177474:7	We must say to our officers now , today , do n't sit back and see the life blood squeezed out of our union .
177491:7	We must fight the challenge for what it is .
177496:81	Colleagues , union de-recognition strikes at the very heart of the trade union movement , and in preparing to face this challenge , the G M B must be at the forefront of the fight .
177500:76	The nineteen eighty Employment Act gives the possibility to the employers through the U K to de-recognize legitimate trade unions and these trade union re representatives has to be the most damaging piece of government legislation of the last two decades .
177541:41	They 're fighting back in other workplaces throughout the U K. We must fully support these workers and campaign for them .
177600:25	As easy as that people who have to work under these conditions , right , in the threat of w threat of labour , have real problems with the kids .
177619:7	Congress must fully support moves by the T U C and the Labour Party to ensure that temporary workers are treated no less favourably than full-time workers .
177690:7	We must all fight together to keep thet
177727:13	Colleagues , short-termism must be opposed and reversed .
177741:11	The employee must leave his or her employment on the chance that their case succeed .
177745:34	To succeed with a er constructive dismissal case the proposed changes must be viewed as fundamental .
177746:97	Many changes are not viewed as fundamental in today 's economic climate , so in theory we may seem to have the backing of the legal scheme , where in practice we have to cope with the interpretation which is weighed towards the employers and their economic arguments .
177767:34	They have they have t why should they even have to contemplate taking this type of industrial action ?
177774:7	We must start by collating and documenting all cases , all changes , where imposed affecting G M B members .
177842:33	There are many sacred cows with within this organization that must be preserved , principally our regional structure , our regional financial structure , er is one of the main things that we have to preserve .
177842:98	There are many sacred cows with within this organization that must be preserved , principally our regional structure , our regional financial structure , er is one of the main things that we have to preserve .
177846:7	There must be created a new and vibrant organization to meet the challenge of the twenty first century and beyond .
177864:31	They require urgent attention by the C E C and must be addressed before any talks are conducted with the T &G .
177869:29	In supporting this document I believe that we have to look realistically to the future and recognize that one general union would benefit trade union members in the U K far better than continuing to be in competition .
177872:52	Conference , with unemployment on the increase and trade union membership on the decline , trade unions must move forward with wider appeal , with a new concept of unionism for the future .
177873:49	But colleagues , although my region supports the document , with such an important issue , caution must be our by-word as some regions have had more success than others .
177890:86	Long time officials , lay officials , staff at the organization , you might as well face up to the fact colleagues , a lot of you will have to go .
177900:15	Cuts are gonna have to be made .
177906:7	We have got to get involved .
177917:58	This exploration of methods aimed at reducing expenditure , while at the same time improving our service , must be continued .
177919:40	But , before we consider any amalgamation with the T &G , we must ensure that our own house is in order .
177920:7	We must ensure that we know in which direction we are going .
177921:7	We must decide how the G M B will cope with dramatic changes that will have , and will take place , in the workplaces that we represent .
177922:7	We must examine in fine detail our own structure .
177928:56	To attract this new category of workers to the G M B our own of servin servicing , will have to change .
177932:35	To make the G M B relevant advice is going to have to be available over the telephone .
177933:89	With the advances in information technology , answers to many questions could be delivered in minutes , not just on industrial issues , like how cold does it have to be before we stop work , or how heavy a load should I lift , but other questions not related to work that we have not always answered in the past .
177952:80	And what we wanna say to the General Secretary and the C E C that during the talks that there is one thing which must be maintained , and that is the structure of the G M B. The T &G comes to join us on our terms .
178003:7	There must be changes .
178004:13	But they will have to be the subject of consultation and debate and I guess that some of the debates will be really quite lively .
178008:46	Support the Report and let 's see if we can succeed in what must be the greatest enterprise in the trade union Movement since the nineteen twenties .
178094:26	Now Congress , I believe that we must adapt the considerable changes which have taken place in the last few years of Tory terrorism .
178104:9	And we must continue to improve and better the information that is provided .
178107:44	Bargaining will be local , and research , whatever nature or subject , will have to be local to support our activists and officials .
178151:8	We must be constantly vigil and keep a sharp look out for new issues which need to be put on our agenda , so that we can keep pace with the changes that affect our members and organization .
178185:28	With the best will in the world many cases have to be withdrawn or discontinued each year .
178223:7	I must confess I was surprised , curious and highly delighted when er you invited me to speak to you here today and er I 'm very and sincerely pleased that you did .
178231:8	You must be the judges of whether or not I 'm the devil or at least his representative , but I hope you do n't see me that way .
178249:47	For U K P L C to succeed in the years ahead , we simply have to agree objectives , navigate by the same map , and aim at the same goals .
178277:7	We must not forget that most economic growth , even in service industries , originates from technological innovation in the manufacturing sector .
178294:59	Industry certainly needs to be high on the political agenda but like Northern Ireland policy , the main parties must agree a mutual policy .
178302:13	We 've both had to cope with two recessions and undergo immense change in that process .
178308:24	Er , speaking of accountants , I must tell you that one of the perks of my job is to be able to get out and about in the real world , to real companies , meeting real people .
178316:10	We only have to look at some of the long-term deals , the single union deals and changed working practices to see that .
178338:38	But there 's another big issue , one that unions and employers have got to tackle to clear the ground for greater cooperation between us , and that 's the still passive acceptance of the them and us syndrome .
178373:27	This is a situation that cannot and must not continue .
178393:9	But it must n't just be left to the activists to recruit .
178394:11	Our national office must help by better media coverage , bringing to non- members attention what we have to offer and how useful it is to belong to a trade union .
178394:53	Our national office must help by better media coverage , bringing to non- members attention what we have to offer and how useful it is to belong to a trade union .
178414:7	We must get the trade organized and on the way to improved working conditions .
178415:42	However , before these aims can be achieved , we first of all have to recruit and this , as I said before , cannot be done without literature required .
178427:52	The wrong that unemployed people are not allowed to join this great union is a wrong that must be righted today .
178430:28	Unfettered competition of dog eat dog policies must surely give way to positive employment policies and achieve what desired , a society set free from idleness .
178454:22	We , the G M B , have got to offer them that support .
178462:10	We will have to offer an alternative to the crap that they are peddling .
178463:8	We have to offer support and , above all , we have to offer hope .
178463:35	We have to offer support and , above all , we have to offer hope .
178481:10	You only have to have w you only have one opportunity to make a first impression er make a first impression .
178543:7	It must be acknowledged there was between nineteen seventy nine and nineteen eighty four a slump in the ship building industry followed by a slump in world sea-borne trade .
178557:12	Firstly , I must pay re tr tribute and say how proud we are at the way that our people in Tyneside have responded to the crisis .
178563:11	The three frigates must be allowed to be completed by Swan Hunter .
178564:9	The government must give the necessary guarantees to enable the Omani order to be placed .
178565:12	The intervention fund must be available to enable Swan Hunters and other naval ship yards to diversify into merchant ship building .
178566:34	This would have saved Camel Lairds and it 's a must to save Swan Hunters .
178607:8	I must start off by highlighting a sad position in my o my own region , and that 's the demise of Camel Laird , another once-great ship building company .
178672:147	I had with the permission of the deputy general secretary leave of conference yesterday I was in London to be told of a further nine hundred redundancies from a company that a short time ago was telling us , and if you look at my report you 'll have to delete the first paragraph where they had secured orders and the security of our members ' employment only to be told yesterday , nine hundred will go .
178694:94	The National Health has told us one and a half percent if we want an extra day 's holiday , if we want an extra day 's holiday , then we would have to take three days , we could take two , that would leave us with half a percent .
178710:7	We must keep both the dockyards open together with the naval base in Portland , in Portsmouth .
178712:7	We must allay those fears for both Devonport and Rossythe and Neil , can we have an update and what the G M B position will be to that response ?
178718:62	With the case of Perry versus Intec and the eternal attorney general has confirmed to Gillian that T U P E must protect both past and present , future pension rights .
178791:51	The black activists ' struggle for human rights within South Africa is one that this union must support we must look to support their unions in every way we can with both resources training and financial support .
178791:62	The black activists ' struggle for human rights within South Africa is one that this union must support we must look to support their unions in every way we can with both resources training and financial support .
178792:95	The changes that have been introduced into South Africa forced upon the white minority government by both international pressure but also by the magnificent work at the A N C in Cosatu must be supported as well but we cannot treat South Africa as anything but a pariah a , a , a national pariah until we see one person one vote , and a black majority government in South Africa .
178793:17	This union , colleagues , must support and strengthen links with South African trade unions .
178813:79	And let us remember that as De Klerk himself said they changed not because as he said , we wanted to but because we had to .
178814:9	And they had to change because apartheid was at a dead end the people of South Africa were continuing with their struggle the country was ungovernable and there stood the prospect of more sanctions which would bring the noose around the apartheid system .
178828:186	We now have a general date for elections in nineteen ninety four and when that date is formally agreed , many sanctions will go and we 're already preparing because Cosatu and the South African Council of Churches believe that there should be a code for investments so that investments go to help uplift people and indeed tomorrow I have to go to Holland for exactly such a conference called by the World Council of Churches and the South African churches .
178836:32	Then after the elections or rather during the elections , we have to make sure that they are free and fair as you 've just heard and we from Britain and the Anti-Apartheid Movement has to be vigilant to ensure that we have international monitors from the U N , from the European Community , from the Commonwealth and individuals from , from Britain and elsewhere .
178836:103	Then after the elections or rather during the elections , we have to make sure that they are free and fair as you 've just heard and we from Britain and the Anti-Apartheid Movement has to be vigilant to ensure that we have international monitors from the U N , from the European Community , from the Commonwealth and individuals from , from Britain and elsewhere .
178837:10	We also have to provide support for the A N C for thirty years a banned organization having to start from scratch in a country where the majority is supported but having no party officers or structures in place because if we suspend support to them or reduce it it will be like having no support of them all this time and just when the bird is about to fly you clip its wings .
178840:9	So we have to move from old structures to new but the first new government of South Africa will be a compromise in itself because it will be a united government but it will inherit not a post-apartheid state as many academics and politicians tell us it will inherit a nil-apartheid state and that is a very big difference we still have to move to the post-apartheid situation which could take decades .
178840:182	So we have to move from old structures to new but the first new government of South Africa will be a compromise in itself because it will be a united government but it will inherit not a post-apartheid state as many academics and politicians tell us it will inherit a nil-apartheid state and that is a very big difference we still have to move to the post-apartheid situation which could take decades .
178844:24	Transport virtually nil for Africans , we have to spend two or three hours a day going to work and the same coming back tired , exhausted and risking their lives with .
178859:8	We have to then work in the future not only to develop South Africa but to develop the region Angola , Mozambique , all the other countries .
178865:178	Technology is changing our world so much that small groups of people through computers and elsewhere are able to determine vast patterns of human behaviour and so it 's gonna be a long struggle but through our struggle in Africa and your struggle here where we all want democracy but democracy 's only a process what we have to contend with is also power because ultimately it 's only when you 're able to exercise that power that you can deliver for the majority of the people .
178873:45	We continue with the struggle and forget the mad whites here and that we have to help them and that 's what our people have to do .
178873:77	We continue with the struggle and forget the mad whites here and that we have to help them and that 's what our people have to do .
178892:109	The recession that we 've gone through in materials and elsewhere in the economy has taught us , or should have taught us I believe , a very clear lesson and that is that we must end the situation that 's in the building materials industry where our members rely for a reasonable standard of living on bonus earnings the problem being of course that as soon as the recession starts to bite , then the bonus pay becomes very vulnerable to attack and reduction by the employers .
178905:95	I am convinced congress , however , that there will be sporadic industrial action throughout the summer if the employers do not change their stance and it 's my view that we have to restart the talks .
178928:20	In the time that I have to move the report I 'd like to concentrate on some of the developments that have been taking place in health and safety this is not to , er , give the impression that environmental developments are not important but over this next year the government are going to be taking certain measures that we need to be aware of , er , in the health and safety area .
178944:8	We have to respond to these developments and it is being made clear now in public , that the Health and Safety Executive are giving every indication to employers that they are not going to rigorously enforce the law and indeed in the local authorities a leading figure there has said that they want to take a softly softly approach .
178945:37	The G M B has rejected this approach and recognized that we have to improve health and safety standards at the workplace .
178947:141	However , the report identifies a number of areas that need to be addressed in more detail as a result we are recommendatin it , recommending that a major consultation exercise be d be conducted this year to ensure that the many ideas that people have to improve our Health , Safety and Environment Service are considered .
178954:63	President in seconding the report I would like to make the following points to our safety representatives who have to bear the responsibility for improving conditions at the workplace for our members .
178955:32	To be successful in improving health and safety standards we must have good workplace organization good laws good inspectors and good guidance all have their place in improving health and safety standards .
178959:26	These important rights mean that the safety representatives must be consulted by the employer well before action is taken and when combined with the existing functions of safety representatives , they provide extensive rights to organize around health and safety at the workplace .
178992:16	We as an organization must be ready to accept the sterling work carried out by our , er R H S Os with the very limited resources at their disposal and particular thanks must go to those R H S Os who find themselves dual-roled as education and political officers .
178992:100	We as an organization must be ready to accept the sterling work carried out by our , er R H S Os with the very limited resources at their disposal and particular thanks must go to those R H S Os who find themselves dual-roled as education and political officers .
179014:76	President , congress we should applaud the work of the Health and Environment department at National Office and in supporting this service report we must go swiftly forward into wide-ranging discussions at all levels of the G M B. The publications they have produced have been of a consistent high standard and are very user-friendly .
179025:19	The environment we live in must also be protected sources of pollution must be located and stopped employers clearly held liable for their actions and dealt with as severely as allowed by law .
179025:42	The environment we live in must also be protected sources of pollution must be located and stopped employers clearly held liable for their actions and dealt with as severely as allowed by law .
179027:55	The situation regarding the enforcement of is disgraceful too few inspectors far too much work therefore we must encourage safety representatives to be more self-sufficient in the workplace leaving the G M B to carry on its campaign for an increase in the inspectorate .
179037:45	Colleagues , to promote a culture of health and safety , our starting point must be to establish a network of safety reps in the workplaces and we must have proper funds for training for all of our safety reps that is a most crucial part of the report .
179037:86	Colleagues , to promote a culture of health and safety , our starting point must be to establish a network of safety reps in the workplaces and we must have proper funds for training for all of our safety reps that is a most crucial part of the report .
179039:50	To make sure the G M B is at the head of the field we must have a reasonable Health and Safety Officer who would ensure that our safety reps and full-time officers are kept up to speed with all the changes in legislation and to provide the adequate training .
179040:15	This of course had to be monitored and accountable a as it is at present in the Southern region where we can already see the benefits .
179057:9	But we have to identify some of the failings of the report at the ninety-f nineteen eighty five congress , motion forty urged the C E C to ensure that each region appoints an officer whose prime responsibility will be health and safety .
179064:42	Health and safety is the one area where shop stewards , safety representatives have to deal with on a daily basis .
179083:71	The , the report addresses the past and current G M B policy but it is the future needs of our members that we must plan for .
179084:7	We must consolidate our expertise and where that expertise is not evident , we must create it .
179084:44	We must consolidate our expertise and where that expertise is not evident , we must create it .
179085:25	In parallel with our training strategy we must ensure sufficient funding for health and safety campaigns if we are to realize the objectives set out in this report .
179194:143	It 's got er , impact , it 's , it appeared relatively small so you know , to erm it 's a fact of life that small prints have a , a lot more to do to keep up with big ones , they have to more impact .
179318:120	It will create interest in the foreground which I think is important and often , especially looking across water an expanse of water if you have n't got any interesting detail in the foreground yo you have to go a long way into the picture before it begins to get interesting .
179362:145	Not so much there , little bit better there , but that bit so , okay , it 's er , you 've set yourself a task to do a sort of a lighting exercise to photograph this camera er so , yo you you know , you must really control the lights and the do the best you can .
179483:10	All you had to do here was to move back a few steps and you 've made it much more interesting in the foreground .
179769:17	Erm so we just have to accept that tourists do n't dress in those sort of clothes .
179795:125	erm the thing about this title portrait which I always er like to emphasize and is that when you 're using props like these stools or any other props at all in this sort of glamour photography then they must be in absolutely pristine condition , and they are here .
179796:89	I just mentioned that so that when you , if you do this type of photography always remember that your props , whatever they might be , must be absolutely in pristine condition .
179875:22	I guess th that you must have be actually been in the basket .
179877:32	I would think if you were n't , you must have been very nearly .
179878:20	Perhaps yeah I think you must have been airborne at that stage to be er , had such a enormous flame going up into the balloon .
179962:7	I must er
179981:32	But we 've had a very good evening and we must thank Mr for it .
180052:31	Yes , she absolutely is so , we 'll have to erm , find out from you what they 've been talking about .
180068:7	I had to go and look at somebody 's chandelier , that was hanging in the cellar
180123:20	But er no , Sir Edward had to go through the full rigmarole of a meeting with the great man , I put that in inverted commas , but er I suppose he thinks he is , the great man himself , Saddam Hussein .
180125:144	I wonder if you feel that even if there was a deal , the British government , the Foreign Office , represented as they were , so admirably really , by Sir Edward Heath , he seems to have done a very good job , I wonder if he had to work very hard , or do you think perhaps , anybody could carry that out ?
180142:171	I was at a dinner other night , er where er French Railways were the hosts , and of course they were doing their best to er tell everybody to travel through the Tunnel naturally enough , because that 's what their trains will be doing come May , and er one or two people , it must be said , were just a touch sceptical .
180189:19	Erm , well if we have to pay twenty pounds extra for erm , an extra television , what about the shops that sell them ?
180191:9	Will they have to pay twenty pounds for each television that they have ?
180203:20	It 's enough that you have to pay for the licence , which is erm , what is it eighty pounds
180272:11	Or did it have to be somebody like Sir Edward ?
180302:48	Well , some of them you greet with more affection than others , it must be said .
180311:21	I suppose er , he must be in the top ten of all-time great British footballers , would n't you say ?
180314:7	You must have some memories of Danny Blanchflower , playing for Spurs and Northern Ireland , if you 'd like to share them with me , it 's .
180327:64	And of course , the fact that you are going to be roving reporters will mean that you will have to , if you become a finalist , be able to do an audition live on air .
180328:9	You must of course , have a valid passport , and you must be free to travel in the last two weeks of January .
180328:39	You must of course , have a valid passport , and you must be free to travel in the last two weeks of January .
180416:9	Two couples must win an all expenses paid trip to Australia with me , when the Breakfast Call comes live from Sydney at the end of January .
180430:34	Undoubtedly , some of you will be , but there must be one or two people who are actually dreading Christmas er bearing in mind that they 've had to ask somebody whom they do n't really want in their house , or perhaps that person or people have asked themselves , and it 's very difficult to know how to refuse is n't it really ?
180430:92	Undoubtedly , some of you will be , but there must be one or two people who are actually dreading Christmas er bearing in mind that they 've had to ask somebody whom they do n't really want in their house , or perhaps that person or people have asked themselves , and it 's very difficult to know how to refuse is n't it really ?
180450:12	Erm , there must several categories .
180460:14	Yes , so you have to , if , you know , with your weekends , where you know there 's a lot of banging of spoons , animated chat , to , to cover up what is so audibly going on upstairs .
180484:7	You have to , because , how can you be busy for that entire period of time ?
180486:8	They have to , they have to come .
180486:20	They have to , they have to come .

180523:53	underneath that exterior , and it made me realize , that you know , you do n't have to like your relatives , I 'm afraid , you have to put up with them , and love them .
180523:86	underneath that exterior , and it made me realize , that you know , you do n't have to like your relatives , I 'm afraid , you have to put up with them , and love them .
180598:152	If you er , send one in , to get it mentioned on the day , well we certainly do our best , er , sometimes , er , the er , anniversaries and the birthdays , not very often , are crowded out by er , any news stories that we may have to bring you , became first and foremost this is a news programme , er reflecting the stories of the day , but generally speaking we manage to get a full list of your dedications in .
180619:12	But Saddam had to just play the whole game , and er , he must have got a lot of propaganda out of this , must n't he ?
180619:45	But Saddam had to just play the whole game , and er , he must have got a lot of propaganda out of this , must n't he ?
180619:77	But Saddam had to just play the whole game , and er , he must have got a lot of propaganda out of this , must n't he ?
180633:68	Yes , and that is Saddam 's dilemma , I mean , yo the point about him is this , one must n't think of him as being a rational er politician who does sensible things , for sensible reasons .
180646:170	No , I mean , there 's nothing to stop him arresting more British people , or er , any nationality , come to that , and saying well , they did stray into our territory , I 'm sorry about this , but er , we ca n't have that sort of thing , you 'll have to er , come and see if I want to release them in a few months .
180654:37	that I fear , that sooner or later , we 'll probably have to go to war with Saddam again
180690:22	More of that later , you must also have a valid passport , and you must be free to travel in the last two weeks of January .
180690:46	More of that later , you must also have a valid passport , and you must be free to travel in the last two weeks of January .
180728:16	You know , one must remember there are so many lonely people , and Christmas is the worst time of the year .
180731:12	Now , I must say that I see there is a point of charging for every television set , erm , I do n't have any er , er objection to that , but one rider , that senior citizens should be helped .
180741:9	Two couples must win the all expenses paid trip to Australia with me , when the Breakfast Call comes live from Sydney , at the end of January .
180768:84	That 's right , this er , this proposal by the Commons ' Heritage Committee , that if you actually want another telly in your house , you have to pay twenty quid extra .
180769:83	well , I have one , and I think that 's expensive enough , but regarding the licence extra money , I think that we should n't have to pay any television licence at all with some of the programmes that we 're getting on , they 're all repeated
180772:54	But , you know , a lot of those repeats get huge audiences , and th they must have repeated Dad 's Army , and ' Ello , ' Ello about fourteen hundred times , but they still get enormous ratings , those programmes .
180783:51	Now , at the time we had my grandmother living with us , so we had to tell her shut up , erm , and when they rang , er on the door , she , she was n't to sort of , call out and you know , to tell us that the door was ringing ,
180832:53	And it may be , that if you have three tellies in the house , you 'll have to pay forty pounds extra .
180900:85	Sounds an exciting trip , really fabulous trip , and it will mean of course , seeing you will be li live on air , that we have to give you a little audition , so the finalists , have to be prepared to do an audition with me , live on air , just before Christmas .

180902:43	You must also , of course , have a valid passport , and you must be free to travel in the last two weeks of January .
180959:129	Larry of course , with er , w w being a famous personality as you are , I mean er , if you were in the book , it would be awful would n't it , cos people would just have to , to er look up Adler , L and they
180970:9	Two couples must win an all expenses paid trip to Australia with me , when the show comes live from Sydney at the end of January .
181054:38	Quite , my goodness me , we er , surely the people must be sick and tired of this lot .
181082:31	Absolutely , I went to see at , we had to trouble at , not of our supporters
181087:7	We must move on , because we 've got to have a commercial break , and then we want to check on the traffic .
181126:8	I must say , he said that he regretted it now .
181231:12	Ergo , we have to look , I think , at the record of this company over the last few years and as the chairman said in his introductory remarks the growth in the company , the growth in the earnings per share , has been very remarkable .
181247:10	I would have to confess that by American standards the er er the , er , directors of Pearson , the executive directors of Pearson and er , the chairman of Pearson and I think that the directors of most English companies are significantly underpaid by U S standards that 's not to say it 's right but , er , that seems to be the , er ha the current trend .
181252:16	It , again I have to , I have to say
181252:28	It , again I have to , I have to say
181534:46	Well I 'm bothered about her health and that and that 's what I must emphasize to her if she 's listening that er as far as we 're concerned we would want to just give her some sympathy advice and support in relation to this matter .
181582:36	Yep erm well anyone can go along but you do have to live in Snainton or St Annes .
181596:17	First of all you have to be unemployed and you have to be black or Asian .
181596:36	First of all you have to be unemployed and you have to be black or Asian .
181598:82	The Race Relations Act says that you can do this you can have courses especially for black or Asian people so as I said you have to be unemployed you have to be black or Asian and you have to live in either Radford Hyson Green St Annes Lenton or Snainton .
181598:102	The Race Relations Act says that you can do this you can have courses especially for black or Asian people so as I said you have to be unemployed you have to be black or Asian and you have to live in either Radford Hyson Green St Annes Lenton or Snainton .
181598:125	The Race Relations Act says that you can do this you can have courses especially for black or Asian people so as I said you have to be unemployed you have to be black or Asian and you have to live in either Radford Hyson Green St Annes Lenton or Snainton .
181639:49	to give us both sides of the argument so we 'll see what they have to say and er invite people 's calls as well see what they think about it .
181690:15	Yes every week it has to be fed .
181822:12	The match may have to be moved because of the recent violence in the province .
181930:24	And we 'll see what they have to say and if you feel so moved you can ring back and shout at them Katherine .
182248:24	Oh are you well you 'll have to come back on Friday then and we 'll find somebody else to take you on tomorrow .
182308:74	The business about sparklers erm it is one of those things where the very young children like to hold a sparkler but it has got to be done under proper supervised conditions .
182593:49	The country will soon be without a viable coal industry , he said , and will have to rely increasingly on imported energy supplies .
182639:7	You have to dial the code O six O two if you 're ringing from outside the Nottingham area .
182885:26	Erm well I think you 'd have to make do with twenty four strong care assistants .
182973:28	Well it 's good fun , you 'll have to join us , you 'll have to come through and have a look .
182973:49	Well it 's good fun , you 'll have to join us , you 'll have to come through and have a look .
183025:157	Well she go Hilda got a baby boy about eighteen month old when I knew her like you know , and er she lived by I think it was I think it was you know and er what happened to her I be I think she had to go in a home or er you see and er baby boy was adopted like , the baby boy that 's about all I know about her that 's about all .
183067:10	Oh it must be fifty years since I 've seen her .
183630:33	Er an and the the bloke who did it erm has got to go down as one of the ratbags of the year .
183676:54	Now apparently what happened is I went up to him and said look I might have to do something with it .
183876:37	Well you know wha when I knew what she had to do , I thought well erm she had to walk on by herself to Annie .
183876:66	Well you know wha when I knew what she had to do , I thought well erm she had to walk on by herself to Annie .
183882:37	And then later on the script she ha to say he had to say to her well , call her , you leave her and if she does n't come to you that 's not your dog and take her to the pound and have her put down .
183911:24	I hate to see that I must say .
183913:9	Then she had to run across the stage on her own .
184016:47	And in the right circumstances er it need not be be criticized , but the circumstances have to be right for it .
184017:8	There has to be good coal pillar support on either side and there has to be a competent roof .
184017:42	There has to be good coal pillar support on either side and there has to be a competent roof .
184030:82	Well they are not being granted more freely , th when a an an exemption is granted , the inspector , the inspector , who grants the exemption has got to say that he is satisfied that the health and safety of the workforce will not be jeopardized .
184072:7	We had to remove the baffle plate and in there was a piece of gauze , that 's the inside cloth , cut to size so it fit in nice .
184087:45	I 've talked to other men who 've fiddled samples , you have to go to course about laws , rules , regulations to do with dust and once lads got talking it comes out how it 's happening .
184129:74	As far as roof bolting and er the er length of advance without supports , current legislation 's very restrictive , I think it has to be opened upwards demonstrated by scientific evidence to be successful .
184142:78	The main thing here concerning is extended cuts with the coal operators is er the buzz word of the coal industry , competitiveness , we have to have extended cuts in order to be competitive .
184225:85	It 's a question of who decides at this point in time with the government that 's making the decision that the workers in this country have to accept lower standards in almost anything not just wages and terms of conditions , now safety standards .
184230:7	We have got to go to work with a lot of of of er tension and pressure on us .
184262:72	I think that 's a a lamentable state of affairs , and their children , and their children 's children are going to have to pay the price for the short-sightedness that 's going on now in the ivory towers of the of the city , the the banking institutions and the financial institutions of the country .
184308:9	Some thing has to be
184382:66	That 's not always attractive cos initially that 's more expensive for them , but er they ha they have to er come to us with an open mind as well .
184390:84	The fifty percent share holding has worked well , because what it means no one person can impose their will , no one has control , you have to resolve problems by agreement , resolve disagreements without coming to blows .
184400:61	The government and the banks are considering setting up a national data system of business angels , it would probably have to be government funded .
184405:48	And er as they 're not in the business of providing risk capital , they have to find er some poor mug or opportunist to do so , and I think this is why increased attention is being focused on on business angels as a source .
184421:24	He agrees that skills inside small companies have to improve .
184430:29	The I O D also believe that there must be tax incentives to invest in Britain 's small businesses , but they 'd like to see them extended to include the general public .
184445:31	For this successful local experiment to have national implications there has to be a fundamental shift in attitudes .
184446:15	The small companies themselves have got to understand what they need to grow is long term financing and that 's cash in the business .
184451:12	The banks too must get involved and everyone needs to work together because if the marriage proves to be a barren one it will affect the wealth of the nation for generations to come .
184458:59	I think they 've got their cost structures er a a little bit out of line and I have to be honest that I think that some of them have thought that er all you have to do is , you know , keep a brass plate outside your door for fifty years and the work would roll in .
184458:119	I think they 've got their cost structures er a a little bit out of line and I have to be honest that I think that some of them have thought that er all you have to do is , you know , keep a brass plate outside your door for fifty years and the work would roll in .
184551:51	With other regional firms joining in the battle for city work , even the biggest London firms have had to cut their fees and shake up their ideas .
184584:53	mother 's house in because my father was in in the first world war so my mum had to go to live with my grandmother and er I was born there and er then when my father came home we came back to my mum came back to she ha got a little house somewhere I forget where it was street , does n't s it 's not there any more .
184637:36	I know the house was only erm we used to have to run down to offices there to pay the rent once a month and it was twelve and six a month for the house and that 's about what it was worth too in them days .
184673:11	We always had to chase after him for it and he 'd never give her more than a pound a week .
184675:9	And we had to go from one pub to the other to look for him .
184685:7	She must 've been .
184718:22	I know we used to have to run to school in the morn er for the shopping in the morning .
184736:13	But er she had to pay her did n't she ?
184764:112	If we had a splinter oh go to auntie my other mm she was n't our aunt really but er she was she was some relation but we used to call her auntie and we 'd have to go to her to take a splinter out of our own finger she us she could n't touch us , was n't that funny ?
184828:26	So you would you well you would have to carry on your life not as normal but you 'd have to eat would n't you ?
184828:61	So you would you well you would have to carry on your life not as normal but you 'd have to eat would n't you ?
184833:83	You know that that 's about all the room there was was honestly was a table and chairs and more often than not a couple of us had to sit on the stairs .
184866:108	er yes I was saying erm they only had the midwives in them days did n't they , to come for the birth and that and anyway my mother was was ill enough to have to send for a doctor .
184874:22	Yes so that 's why she had to have a doctor for that one .
184875:37	So anyway , she got over it and all she had to do she she tell her to stay in bed now for s so many days but she 'd be up again the following day and then the nurse 'd come and have a look under her feet and she 'd say you been up again she 'd say .
184878:26	But as she said she she just had to she could n't stay in bed when she had kids running all over the place .
184904:53	And when she came home she said , Do you know what she said she must have taken ages she said to put that cord through that er beam , she said .
184905:8	She must have taken a knife to push the cord through , she said , there was hardly any room for it .
184919:77	Oh it was a dreadful thing when you come to think of it now , the poor women could n't help it she was must have been in desperate straits to do a thing like that .
184930:57	You said that erm your mother would after the confinement and after the birth she would erm have to do the normal housework ?
185019:45	And er because that 's where we were all the time so you had to learn to swim from no age at all .
185075:44	Was was that sort of thing quite usual then that the that the children had to find out
185091:25	So oh I said mam do I have to ?
185099:34	But as regards going out to play we always had to take some of the others with us .
185130:31	And she could n't visit anybody otherwise she 'd have to take some of us and y She was n't very welcome anyway with two or three kids behind her .
185156:69	Because then they knew that we a couple of the kids were really terrified of him and if they 'd only have to hear his his footsteps walking up the street and they 'd start to shake .
185163:61	She could n't she could n't er talk to him like that you know at all so she had to chastise us .
185185:113	Because we went b I think I was n't er a very well child and the doct when I left school the doctor said I left school at fourteen and he said I had to erm find a job out of doors .
185283:7	There must be money in slate .
185288:22	Aye in no time , cos there must be money in slate Aye .
185352:48	Not a scrap of slate would have been made there , and he would have had to do something with us then .
185423:81	Well we were all union members , and everybody wanted to be together , if you are if you are in the union well we had to stuck together an the the more we stayed together the stronger we are , to keep out if we can stay out .
185495:7	Must must be terrible man to do a thing like that eh .
185519:83	If we 'd a carried it on for say this time of the year now you with this erm Whitsun Holiday now , we 'd have had to to do it seven days a week , cos you 'd have to be there Saturday and Sunday to stop anything going in there .
185519:122	If we 'd a carried it on for say this time of the year now you with this erm Whitsun Holiday now , we 'd have had to to do it seven days a week , cos you 'd have to be there Saturday and Sunday to stop anything going in there .
185525:100	So er er well we could n't carry it out , cos the the ones who were n't prepared to do the picket was n't erm going to do it , we 'd have to do more of ' em to keep these youngsters on doing the picket , you know .
185553:51	You know if you 're out on strike you 're out on strike and must make it hundred percent , that 's how it is .
185554:35	Cos if you do anything you doing you must do it , go at it the right way and stick to it , ai n't it .
185610:32	we 've worked out each of the Midlands clubs has to play sixteen Midlands Derbies
185630:10	Leicester have had to cope with a lot of injuries in the early part of the season the most serious blow the loss of Steve Walsh .
185631:48	His height and strength will be badly missed in attacked as Leicester field what must be the smallest striking partnership in the First Division .
185670:78	He 's he 's a quick nimble defender Speedy was just hanging hanging on waiting for the ball to be played into him and I must confess I did n't really see anything afterwards I mean well if you look at that that does n't seem anything untoward does it ?
185702:12	They 're gonna have to play their way in .
185800:8	I must confess when this one dropped down at him and he chested it out it 's a lovely little bit of link up play by Jochim again .
185803:20	Now this is and I must admit when he pulled the trigger then I thought that was going to go right in the back of the net .
185832:26	I think Leicester public are gonna have to be a little bit patient with their team .
185850:7	I have to say I think big Stan took the wrong option then you know .
185913:38	And it 's been bought upon by necessity really they 've had to play their way through and they certainly should be capable of doing that .
185964:35	Why the second free kick was given in Leicester 's favour must remain an even greater one .
185980:10	But I must admit I 've got to know what happened with that goal , or free kick in
185981:40	Yes another assignment for the dreaded Newbon I think he 'll have to speak to the referee about that .
186063:73	Well I saw a sending off yesterday on television that er I thought was nowhere near as severe as that and I must say that he 's a very luck man Stan .
186112:13	Yes and Forest have got to find a better route to goal than that and we 'll find out whether they can in a few moments .
186151:15	So er we 've had to take him off .
186194:125	And a foul by Whitlow on Rozario and pain written all over Robert Rozario 's face and we saw that the last time we had a Nottingham Forest live game when he collided with a post up at Bolton Wanderers and had to go off with a rib and facial injuries .
186206:50	Neil Webb is the remaining substitute as well as substitute goalkeeper Mark Crossley and Frank Clarke must be thinking how many more injuries am I gonna get this season .
186209:132	And Rozario looks in trouble at the moment he is just er limping around he 's sunk back to his er hands on his knees again and well look at that he you do n't really need words to describe how he must be feeling at the moment .
186217:80	So only Neil Webb left if you discount the goalkeeper and I remember the last time we did that Forest live game up at Bolton Forest had to use their both their substitutes in that game as well quite early on .
186220:18	I think he might have to come off soon .
186235:41	Important period for Forest to keep pressing on if they 're gonna have to make another change .
186269:19	Considering the disruptions Forest have had to er undergo here they 're getting back into this game impressively at the moment .
186278:38	But Crosby almost released Stone then into a good position and you have to say Forest have certainly had the best of this second half .
186289:31	Thomson Lewis he 's so direct this lad you have to check though as Gemmell action stride for stride .
186303:41	Well that 's very harsh particularly in view of the stick the forwards have to take .
186399:28	Knocks it in and er once again I have to say Whitlow did well .
186463:8	I must confess the moment er Stan Collimore set it up for Webb , I mean it 's a nice ball he does brilliant here Colin , checks the and shapes a nice little ball into Webby 's path and the one thing Webby 's still got he 's he 's got good feet .
186464:27	I fancied Webby to score there I must confess .
186475:13	Fair enough I must say I 'd have given it to Whitlow myself but it does n't really matter as far a Leicester fans are concerned as long as they can hold on here for another two minutes now .
186485:20	And still Collimore and then Hill has to concede the corner .
186515:122	David Speedy 's goal enough to get all three points for Leicester and I think on the balance of play they just about edged it but Forest put up a marvellous performance in the second half especially when they had to make er changes and things did n't go well for them .
186532:7	You must consider yourself very unlucky with that result .
186559:61	We know Gary Ball 's out I do n't know how long for but I think Frank will seriously have to look to give this lad some support because he he 's doing great up there on his own there 's no doubt about that .
186575:31	That apart Derby are unstoppable at home and it must be some consolation to Arthur Cox that the twelve million pound team he assembled at last looks the part .
186581:80	Once it evaporated and Darren Wassle was eventually dismissed for a crime which bore no resemblance to the magnitude of the sentence , well Palace must have fancied their chances .
186637:27	Floats it in towards Kennedy the chance must be here for Ray it 's there and it 's Kennedy .
186669:19	Yes frightening no we 'll have to put that right .
186685:21	What sort of sacrifices did you have to make when you were quotes an unknown then ?
186741:10	We 'll have to see .
186762:33	It says it 's wrong that a judge should have to pass the same sentence on an abused wife who kills a brutal husband as it does on a robber armed with a shotgun who kills in cold blood .
186780:156	We were talking on the subject of erm divorce in in yesterday morning 's programme and this idea that erm the the whole procedure of getting a divorce som er would be speeded up and there 'd be something called , No faults divorce , so that people would n't have to point accusatory fingers at one another .
186787:15	I mean we have to work very hard in our own er relationship we 've had our ups and downs we 've gone through many difficult times like unemployment and even homelessness and you know we we 've gone through it but when you make your promises you say you 'll stay together for richer for poorer in sickness and in health and so on .
186867:109	But there is a fall-back position and that is that the European Community have a directive called the Environmental Impact Assessment Directive that requires that before a major project of this type is put through there must be the fullest public consultation .
186875:69	What do you think to erm what erm you 've just heard the North Yorkshire Euro M P Edward have to say there about his erm keenness to see a public inquiry ?
186884:32	Well le let 's just hear what er Peter has to say about that .
186901:131	There are few people , I 'm very concerned for those people and we will be imposing conditions if members wish to approve it to protect the interests of the few people in close proximity , many of the objectors er they must be heard and their point of view is report in the committee papers but they do live at er a couple of miles from the site .
186902:47	Er I would say that the impact of the development if it goes ahead must be limited at that distance .
186903:74	I do n't believe there will be problems at that distance of noise of dust and the visual impact of this hill must be limited at that distance .
186919:91	I 'll let Peter come back to you in just a moment erm and there are more question I would ask you as well but erm now we must take a short break with time at nine twenty six .
186941:11	Well the I have to disagree with Mr on this .
186985:49	So if the H M I P are now at one with Selby then they must still stand by their view that there is a considerable risk to air quality as outlined in point one of their letter of the eighth of September .
187036:242	That is what they 're saying and I think that that can only be seen as eminently reasonable and I think that that Edward has hit the nail right on the head when he says look if this issue is not properly considered locally there can be no alternative if Government fails in its duty to call it in in the in the interests of of the local communities and the region at large , then it will have to go to Brussels .
187091:95	Er yes well that is so this did come through er very very late indeed er in the and the Parish Council of course are in the situation where they have to cover all eventualities and what er Mr is referring to is a suggestion of using a one O six agreement to protect as far as possible the local communities when the tip is erected .
187093:26	It was the Parish Council themselves who had to consider things very quickly and go for what they could best endeavour but you c er I ca n't see how that can be used to nullify the general view of the public of South Milford and the other parishes .
187101:51	Can we in the alternative put our case if that is a fait accompli then there must be something for the local communities to be derived from this and therefore we went for protection under one O six agreement as Stewart quite rightly refers to and we also went for the dedication of large areas of the resultant heap for landscaping and for public open space .
187111:26	Well we 've heard what Edward has had to say and the local communities I 'm certain draw great comfort from that and we wait and see whether Brussels will exercise its powers , quite legitimately in my view , and and call this in .
187113:29	Erm those are the issues which will have to be very carefully balanced .
187119:7	We have got to balance environmental issues and economic issues , We 've got a coal field that is a successful coal field it has a severe problem .
187154:203	I hope you enjoyed that discussion I mean well first of all if you live in the Selby area it 's been of relevance to you and you 've managed to hear what both sides are saying but I I hope even if you do n't live in the Selby area it 's er you 've er found it as fascinating as I have to hear the pros and cons of such a complex issue .
187159:15	We people who must vote for the Party if we are ever to win power again .
187203:7	We have to make sure in this trade union and labour movement that because there will be struggles ahead , this has to be one that is foremost in our minds .
187203:66	We have to make sure in this trade union and labour movement that because there will be struggles ahead , this has to be one that is foremost in our minds .
187204:9	This conference has to give a message to Jo John Smith to maintain union links , to strengthen them , not destroy them .
187205:71	Our party is about morolity morality , morality and justice and truth and it 's about representing our class , That 's what we have got to get back to to win the next election .
187211:58	The trade unions depend on effectively representing working people in industrial field for their survival and the Labour Party has to represent the trade unions for their survival in the political field .
187245:52	We 're talking about three nine six G M B Parliamentary Panel Dick and I 'll just have to follow Duncan , he had his little rhetoric on the Labour Party that he 's he believes in so much .
187254:9	Oldham about must be the only place where the l M Ps have never seen the town .
187266:16	The Labour Party front bench must realize that the ordinary trade union members voted , as I said before , for a say in the Party .
187351:13	What everybody must realize is this , the trade union movement is the meat on the Labour Party 's bones and without us the Party would be a skeleton , lost in a political wilderness .
187408:83	I have over the years many times come to the rostrum but for the first time it gives me no pleasure at all in saying what has to be said .
187417:16	The link with Labour has got to be more than just signing a cheque .
187421:20	Our , our minimum demand colleagues must be one , a reformed if electoral college for a selection of leader and for candidates , to a continual role for trade unions at conference .
187447:26	Now I supported Prescott , I must say I voted for him for the er for deputy leader , right , but I think he 's wrong , right , on this particular issue , this compromise that he 's floating and I think it should be dropped .
187464:111	We have already experienced the abolition of free eye and dental checks , we are suffering from the creeping privatization of the Health Service , the selling off of our water , our crumbling schools , and yet we have to concentrate on the issue of trade union , Labour Party links .
187484:13	Colleagues , we must ensure that the links are strengthened and not weakened .
187498:34	I say this because I believe that those constitutional issues have to be decided once and for all at this year 's Party Conference .
187520:15	People are gonna have to work very hard to repair that damage .
187570:61	The same question , that lack of influence on Labour authorities who are behaving like the worst Tory employers , has to be posed in relation to a number of situations throughout the country .
187601:7	We must not let them forget where the Party came from .
187604:11	So this Congress must pursue on our behalf , a serious approach to the Labour Party to reduce the price tag .
187628:23	We all are aware that funds have to be generated but it , it causes a lot of membership .
187629:27	That other means of raising revenue will have to be looked for , I second .
187644:7	We had to change direction .
187675:190	The C E C has no difficulty with the principle to restrict numbers of full-time officials er , that are required , however erm , I think we also want to take into account er , the developments that are referred to in the motion with respect of the Labour Party and if these developments take place we will obviously have to examine that before we come to any decision on the matter .
187735:13	Colleagues , we must not forget the low paid and the part-time workers , the majority of whom are women .
187736:22	To these people , we not only have to offer an attractive package but to be more visible , especially during these troubled times .
187744:63	That back-up service would also allow our full-time officers to concentrate on the recruitment and servicing of our members , which must and must only be and remain our highest priority .
187744:67	That back-up service would also allow our full-time officers to concentrate on the recruitment and servicing of our members , which must and must only be and remain our highest priority .
187749:70	The only way forward for this great union is for all of us to recruit new members , so all of us must take this responsibility seriously .
187793:67	However , we do have some occasional vacancies , maternity leave , building maintenance work , long term sick , where we have to make sure our labour force is protected , where we do involve temporary labour and even on those occasions we attempt to employ people direct as some regions know .
187853:86	I do n't suppose many have read it in depth , cos to be honest , when do we read a rule when we do n't have to , unless we absolutely need it .
187861:52	They would obviously have some idea from the appeal hearing it itself but since they have to put all of their reasons for their request in writing the very least I believe they should be able to have is a reasoned reply .
187863:74	It 's from the Regional Secretary , I write with reference to your appeal to the Regional Committee of today 's date and I have to inform you that your appeal was unsuccessful .
187886:76	Again this is about the procedure that we 're following , but we 're talking now about rules procedures for branches and I have to say that I 'm up here without the support of my region on this one .
187895:12	Well , it has to borrow rule six , that we were talking about just now .
187896:88	You might say to yourself , well is this a very rare occurrence , so that really this branch is making a fuss about nothing , branches do n't have to go through appeals procedures , cos it never happens .
187902:82	If we look at rule six , and we 've all been given rulebooks , if people have brought them with us , what we have to do is bend that rule so that it applies to branches , not members .
187904:33	Should any branch have any complaint to make they must do so to their branch secretary who must submit the matter to the branch , it 's talking to yourself .
187904:59	Should any branch have any complaint to make they must do so to their branch secretary who must submit the matter to the branch , it 's talking to yourself .
187999:53	The logic is obvious , we have seven sections now , seven sectional conferences , these conferences must have proper terms of reference , proper guidelines for debate and clear rules as to who can attend , who can speak and who can vote , and that 's the most important part of our report .
188007:68	They are concerned with the industry and the section of industry alone , but of course the issue that we then have to deal with is , we must make sure that those section committees , those national section committees , carry credibility with the members working in that section .
188007:89	They are concerned with the industry and the section of industry alone , but of course the issue that we then have to deal with is , we must make sure that those section committees , those national section committees , carry credibility with the members working in that section .
188008:8	They must been seen , their decisions must be seen to reflect the interest and wishes of members currently employed in the section , and as we have always believed industrial and negotiating policy is best made by members at work in the sector who feel the day to day pressures , know what is going on , motion one one one A seeks to ensure that this will happen .
188008:24	They must been seen , their decisions must be seen to reflect the interest and wishes of members currently employed in the section , and as we have always believed industrial and negotiating policy is best made by members at work in the sector who feel the day to day pressures , know what is going on , motion one one one A seeks to ensure that this will happen .
188015:74	Now , of course , when you put restrictions on that seem to deny any group of members any rights , you must be very careful .
188053:13	Colleagues , I must oppose this rule amendment .
188055:62	Colleagues , I have members in my branches who are unemployed but still pay full contributions not because they have to cos they want to ,
188179:10	We therefore have got to oppose rule amendment one one one A as well as oppose the Sectional and Industrial Conference Report for the same reason .
188194:16	Therefore Congress , we must call on the C E C to answer the confusion in plain English , so that I , and I 'm sure many other of our members , can understand in the form of a document circulated to the branches so that we can go forward into the future at least understanding where we fit into our own union .
188230:32	All the national officers are held to account , they have to give a report of their activities and delegates can challenge them .
188241:23	The General Secretary and the C E C have to be quite clear , the cost will have to met by other means than altering our annual congress .
188241:50	The General Secretary and the C E C have to be quite clear , the cost will have to met by other means than altering our annual congress .
188261:10	Surely this must be the way forward for the G M B and a much fairer and democratic way for our grass root members , who after all are the backbone of this industry , it 's their we discuss at our section conferences , it 's their wages , it 's their terms .
188319:44	But as with most documents that come as packages er , we either have to accept the good with the bad or say no , and enough 's enough .
188359:44	Mould this lot of nonsense down , because me as a boilermaker had to live forty four years and there ai n't enough people are still working to be able to run the sections .
188364:10	People 'll have to come to their own conclusions .
188395:197	The intention , however , as is clear from the document , is to cut back on the number of industrial conferences as that work is being swallowed up by the section conferences and as Robert in seconding the report made perfectly clear , industrial conferences , now called delegate conferences will only be held if there is a negotiating body for which the delegate conference has to frame policy , or in a number of other very limited situations .
188403:10	We may have to follow up with other arrangements in the future .
188411:38	If people want to discuss matters of general concern , they must get themselves elected to this Congress .
188414:11	The Apex conference must come to terms with the nature of that amalgamation and that said that the Apex conference would concern itself with matters of interest to white collar workers .
188416:29	We ca n't compromise on that principle , we have to ask you to oppose motion one one O .
188423:25	From time to time national committees will have to take hard decisions about the strategy for that particular sector , that 's what they 're there for .
188429:45	They can go there as they did with the industrial conferences , but we have to make this careful balance between parts of our membership .
188489:7	We have got to protect not only our members ' rights , but our public services , and from this conference today we 've got to make it quite clear , to central government , that we demand investment in our public services .
188491:7	We must demand investment in training , in education , in order that we can provide those quality services .
188510:18	The message from our Congress must be quite clear .
188518:61	Our commitment to quality public services , they 're efficiently run , publicly accountable and operated without exploiting workers , must be and will be our main goal .
188522:11	But the message must be quite clear .
188575:33	regardless of the inconvenience to their customers who might have to travel further afield , away from their homes and communities for treatment .
188576:7	Fundholders have to manage their financial budget they 're told , like any other small or medium sized businesses .
188584:90	And publisly , publicly and forcibly on that day , which is a date we should be celebrating the forty fifth anniversary of our National Health Service , instead we will have to demonstrate to save our National Health Service .
188659:7	I have to show you this , cos that is the disgrace and you all saw it , we read it on Tuesday .
188662:105	The only money they put in to the chief executives and their two yearly pay re review performances that they get , for cutting other people 's wages or contracting Health Services and for somebody to have to travel that distance for a , to die , is absolutely appalling and it 's a disgrace .
188691:38	While they haggle over the prices in the Trusts , you must continue to suffer and the socially deprived remained bottom of the waiting lists .
188702:7	All must have heart .
188748:9	Health care must be another on his list .
188852:48	We assert that strong trade union relationships , on a day to day basis , must be developed in a bilateral form and this agreement provides for substantial trade union cooperation in the European Community and beyond , and it 's already materially advancing the interests of our members and assisting the development of free and independent trade unionism in Eastern and Central Europe and the former Soviet Republics .
188853:109	And the importance of this work , colleagues , will become clearer later in this report , but at this point er , President , I would wish to place on record , although he 's now has to leave er , to catch his plane , the attribute to my friend and colleague , who was here during the earlier part of Congress , as an honoured guest .
188889:10	I do have to thank on behalf of my stewards ' committee er , Terry who gave us a lot of help and also the er , Regional Section who also helped us .
188903:24	In answer , first of all I must thank Ken for er , his erm , his comments .
188905:18	I think what we have to understand , colleagues , is that this report actually is put to bed , print-wise , well in advance of this Congress .
188911:59	I cannot possibly and conceivably , and no good other individual officer , actually handle all those and some them have to be delegated .
188924:53	We had tried to get a couple of er , here in Portsmouth but he had to attend , so we thought as we prepared for this conference this morning er , on the miners , that it would be appropriate to get a miner 's lamp to put and have them simply inscribed with the erm , the memory of the occasion , which turned out to be
188955:34	Firstly , the primary objective for us as a trade union must to be ensure G M B activists , shop stewards and officials all have access to training and computer literacy .
188956:11	And adequate software must be made available to ensure G M B activists can put into practice what they 've been taught and use it to the labour movement 's advantage .
188989:48	If the evolution of the E C continues , and it will , working people must be as organized as possible to ensure that trade unions are not forgotten in the race for a single market .
188991:7	We must continue to forge links with sister unions right across the E C , and what better ways to target our priorities in this area , by targeting the languages , training in the union .
188995:7	We must work together in Europe , colleagues .
188996:7	We must work with trade unionists of different nationalities and language groups to make sure that European movement is united and speaks with one voice .
189017:7	We must ensure that the T U C tr er , programme remains , otherwise the cost to our union funds will be astronomic .
189049:57	If your ability to gain the skills and information needed to combat the many complex issues that you have to deal with is impaired , then the government and employers will have what they want .
189138:37	Naturally , I understand the balance of , the balance has got to be kept right and we should n't sacrifice the training of our activists to get more revenue in by renting it out to commercial firms , UNISON , I do n't know , the Pet Food Retailers ' Association or whatever .
189216:52	And of course , if this union and the trade union movement is to prosper then we must encourage our young people to come through .
189252:33	The same firm immediately sacked him , because they would have to increase his wages and he 's never had a proper job since .
189256:7	They must be a priority target group , so we can prevent exploitation and discrimination and provide them with adequate training in health and safety and other matters .
189277:7	We must recognize the need to encourage a youth of the G M B to participate more fully within the union .
189284:16	The feeling of helplessness must be so overpowering as young one , as one young man told me , we are the forgotten ones .
189290:7	We must encourage a youth to become shop stewards and safety representatives .
189291:7	We must ensure that black and ethnic minorities are represented in our youth section and those with disabilities who are very often forgotten about .
189319:42	Composite nine is about putting young people back to work and that has to be a priority in a year which has seen youth unemployment hit the one million mark .
189335:109	So for example , er on Russo 's model we saw the people are not consultive on the issue of whether the State should go to war or not , because that 's a particular act and must be left to the executive .
189340:15	At some point individuals must administer , you ca n't have a committee carrying out the
189342:8	You must need some individual point by that committee and the same is true for governments .
189357:29	What they would say is that we have to , perhaps we do have to leave things to the individual , but we should leave as little possible to individuals , as little as practically possible so that we should the people involved in making all the important decisions , particularly the carrying out of them that we have to leave to particular appointed individuals .
189357:48	What they would say is that we have to , perhaps we do have to leave things to the individual , but we should leave as little possible to individuals , as little as practically possible so that we should the people involved in making all the important decisions , particularly the carrying out of them that we have to leave to particular appointed individuals .
189357:181	What they would say is that we have to , perhaps we do have to leave things to the individual , but we should leave as little possible to individuals , as little as practically possible so that we should the people involved in making all the important decisions , particularly the carrying out of them that we have to leave to particular appointed individuals .
189375:7	We have to understand first of all what Mill thinks the proper function of government
189379:10	Secondly they have to manage the affairs of government well , or rather erm , so they have to manage the affairs of the state .
189379:54	Secondly they have to manage the affairs of government well , or rather erm , so they have to manage the affairs of the state .
189399:9	So you have to insulate the , the administrators from direct control of the people if you , if the administrators are going to make good decisions .
189400:12	The people just have to trust the administrators at a certain point , rather than trying to er second guess all of their decisions .
189409:66	For Mill it 's very important that citizens are educated for their role and although participation on a na national level has to be something that can be restricted only to the few , Mill nevertheless wants active participation of the citizens in other aspects .
189501:109	Now he says that someone who does n't hold much property can prove that they 're educated they should get the extra votes too , but you do n't seem , you do n't have to prove that you 're er educated if you 're rich you just get the votes anyway because that 's a good .
189506:88	One way in which he does that he thinks is by plural voting , that you give the educated more than one vote , he says we have to make sure the educated do n't form their own class with their own class interests , but , but giving the educated a bigger say will lead us to make better decisions he thinks .
189516:51	Now critics of contemporary systems say so much for the worse for contemporary system , we have to move to one of the other models , maybe suitably amended and only then will we be truly free and equal .
189519:89	What Barry says is simply this that suppose we accept the point that authority structures are now necessary , that we could n't have anarchy we have to have
189622:91	Hello seven three one eight , no Roger 's off duty at the moment it 's Chris here erm , he should be , hang on I 'll just have to look at the watch roster and check up on precisely what his movements are , erm just look through tomorrow and I can find the right page in the roster here , er , two thir yeah , he 'll be on tower , so he 'll be in first thing tomorrow from about seven , seven o' clock onwards .
189695:12	So we 'll have to carry on
189720:26	Well , Moscavisi 's argument , and I must say , I agree with him , is that they tended to be denigrated by both groups who might have taken the biggest interest in them .
189729:44	Again , there 's been an astonishing neglect , not so much I , I have to point out in fairness , of Totem and Taboo , as we 'll see .
189767:9	And I must say , I was impressed , I thought the , the presentations were excellent in both classes and we covered a lot of the material very well , I thought .
189782:40	Erm , mainly out of perversity , I do admit , because I must be the only social scientist of my generation who 's read all of them from cover to cover .
189830:13	But if you had to explain why you have to obey the taboo , you would probably find it very , very difficult in the , in the sense that , taboo prohibitions are not like legal rational ones .
189830:31	But if you had to explain why you have to obey the taboo , you would probably find it very , very difficult in the , in the sense that , taboo prohibitions are not like legal rational ones .
189839:7	That has to be the reason .
189922:88	For example , Darwin er , remarks , and here I quote , even in the first edition of the Origin of Species , I distinctly stated that great weight must be attributed to the inherited effects of use and disuse , with respect both to the body and the mind .
190000:73	in trying to answer these questions and psychological analyses and the whole appropriate to the age of the and I quote we must not forget that but is also a law giver and educator Egyptian Pharaoh undeniably Egyptian in origin .
190038:37	Er , it 's certainly what happened to me I must admit in fact it 's certainly been the pattern of my life and er I 'm not surprised what thought , Freud thought was a kind of typical er typical pattern .
190065:88	Erm and er I was wondering if Freud did that or if that 's what Freud was saying , that , that , that religion by nature must be repressed or that a minority as the nature of minority is , is er it works harder when it 's repressed or it can become stronger .
190077:39	You could use the word god but not the word they had to be suppressed .
190095:134	If , if , if you 're right about this could you explain the psychological mechanism that makes these kinds of returns of the repressed happen , I mean why did the Fre why did the French students feel they had to recreate the revolution ?
190098:21	I mean why do people have to kind of , if , if , if we accept for a minute that there 's something in this analogy , this model that Freud is talking about , why do people have this compulsive need to repeat like this , why do they have to repeat history ?
190098:160	I mean why do people have to kind of , if , if , if we accept for a minute that there 's something in this analogy , this model that Freud is talking about , why do people have this compulsive need to repeat like this , why do they have to repeat history ?
190214:78	Erm I would have thought this was welcome news in the modern world actually when you know all these people in the Middle East have got to live together .
190277:31	Er Andrea , er it 's gone eleven I must n't detain you any longer .
190316:23	Okay that 's basically erm I have to say .
190324:31	In the case of human beings of course you have to notice that men seem to have an advantage because as I think I mention i in the lectures , it 's perfectly possible , you see this happening in our own society which is supposed to be monogamous , perfectly possible for a man to get married , raise a family and then in his forties to desert his wife and raise a second family .
190325:134	It 's paradoxical because often divorce law reforms thought of as favouring women and in circumspect that allows women to get away from an unreasonable husband and that kind of thing , it 's certainly true , but at the same time you have to notice that in terms of reproductive success it may benefit more er men more .
190326:31	Okay , now so I think what one may have to say it depends on the species and the circumstance .
190339:143	Now , this contribution is not direct , it 's indirect in the sense that males , a male for example who is provisioning a wife who is pregnant is not directly invent investing in the offspring clearly you ca n't do that she has to do that , cos the offspring 's inside her body , but indirectly he may be feeding his wife , protecting her and providing for her in , in a way that is absolutely critical to her reproductive success too .
190340:142	So it 's important to notice that in many species and certainly in ours , although males need not as you say make any contribution apart from their genes in principle , in fact males are heavy investors in offspring , albeit indirectly , so that must be important must n't it and that must
190340:153	So it 's important to notice that in many species and certainly in ours , although males need not as you say make any contribution apart from their genes in principle , in fact males are heavy investors in offspring , albeit indirectly , so that must be important must n't it and that must
190340:167	So it 's important to notice that in many species and certainly in ours , although males need not as you say make any contribution apart from their genes in principle , in fact males are heavy investors in offspring , albeit indirectly , so that must be important must n't it and that must
190426:16	So a young man really has to get initiated and conform to what the elders expect if he 's going to have any reproductive success at all and that 's exactly what happens .
190437:159	But of course it 's , it 's a very tough deal for women , I mean women in erm in a way really get the raw end of it because that to some extent they 're at the mercy of the whole system , even though they can if they absolutely have to .
190442:43	Then when you look at the other range of human societies , then you have to say well you know how is it , how is it working out in other in other types of societies where all the basic erm conditions of life may be different and that of course is one of these big erm big and small problems that we still , we 're still really at the at the starting point fact .
190450:30	I think , I think it think it must cut quite a lot because I mean there 's certain I do n't these biological constraints .
190452:48	What people to look you know in the modern society women do n't have to rely on men or do n't have to have traditional sex roles , this is a point of view is n't it ?
190452:72	What people to look you know in the modern society women do n't have to rely on men or do n't have to have traditional sex roles , this is a point of view is n't it ?
190453:41	Well I think er I think , well I think you have to have , I mean I do n't really parental investment and stuff like that gestation period .
190454:130	I think , I think that in any , I mean in , in , in , if you wanna , if you wanna look at it in terms I mean I think labour it it 's always gonna have to be there and I think the biological constraints put the you know , sharpened device
190461:10	Yes I must say I , I personally sympathy with that I mean I think that erm , women 's er role is er very much despised and disparaged it should be because if you think about it they 're having the children and bringing them up , well this is one of the most worthwhile things to do
190480:36	You see it may be that Dean 's right I must admit I think I , I agree with Dean I think he is right that the real problem is that natural selection may have fitted us by , as it were , rigging our emotional system .
190541:15	Erm , I 'll have to sign the form .
190574:73	Well done Joy erm a nice summary of a complex book and er there 's obviously a lot of things that will have to go of the erm lecture on it next week , so really this is not due to be talked about .
190597:128	The leader as always is er is a directive agency , the leader as it were erm takes over the individual self-determination by erm effectively telling telling the good what to do erm how can this er does this have to be in in one direction only I mean one gets the feelings very often you know you see things in the newspaper crowd hysteria and so on , erm do crowds always have to become kind of primitive and regressed or or can leaders influence them in other directions ?
190597:240	The leader as always is er is a directive agency , the leader as it were erm takes over the individual self-determination by erm effectively telling telling the good what to do erm how can this er does this have to be in in one direction only I mean one gets the feelings very often you know you see things in the newspaper crowd hysteria and so on , erm do crowds always have to become kind of primitive and regressed or or can leaders influence them in other directions ?
190599:14	So does that always have to happen ?
190601:19	Do , do groups always have to the behaviour and performance of their members or can they do the opposite ?
190608:7	there must be some people there that wonder what that was really .
190650:9	So I must say I entirely agree with Heather on this , it seems to me inevitable logic of Freud 's theory and erm my own view is that group psychoanalysis is a contradiction in terms , you cannot do psychoanalysis in a group of this and those who say they can I think have n never understood what psychoanalysis is all about and are misleading the public and people pay good money for it .
190651:176	I think if you say you do suggestion therapy in a group , that 's fine , that 's honest and correct , but to say you can do analysis in a group I think is , is is actually erm erm fraudulent in the sense that it is not true analysis , it must be suggestion therapy .
190670:52	Yes , I think whenever one makes judgment about therapy being better or worse you have to say er on what criteria and there are certainly certain criteria on which group therapy would do better for certain problems like us making feel people feel better if they had a symptom or problem which erm make them feel worse because , because they felt isolated from the community , so it means other people who have got the same problem makes you feel better erm and er certainly suggestion therapy can produce dramatic results especially in the short run .
190715:18	Because I think we have to make distinctions here between different types of libido .
190725:269	I mean erm you know erm when I go to the London Group erm we all know that erm actually er there 's a kind of , there 's an inner feeling you know well we 've got the right computers , we , we 're the you know , we , we believe computing and we , we 're very sorry you know we 're erm we may not actively despise them , but we , we 're sorry that they have to bother with such an awful operating system and everything else .
190753:49	For example one notices over many years of you know having teaching I must have taught hundreds now in different class groups , ca n't help noticing that although you 're the same , subject is the same , the syllabus is the same , the reading list is the same , the room is the same , the time of day may be the same , but the groups are completely different .
190759:24	at the end of the day there must be something
190768:22	Well look folks we 'll have to stop now it 's gone eleven and I have to give a lecture Joy , er that was an excellent er summary , well done .
190768:56	Well look folks we 'll have to stop now it 's gone eleven and I have to give a lecture Joy , er that was an excellent er summary , well done .
190776:53	Nature of course as you know is the world 's leading science journal and er I have to read Nature every week .
190818:50	Mind you , she was starving herself to the point of endangering her life and had to be hospitalized , but er oh no , her hormon her hormon well her hormonal changes went into reverse , they absolutely did .
190824:51	As we know er Darwin published his great work in eighteen fifty nine cos he had to , he really did n't want to but was forced , but in eighteen seventy one he published another important book called the Descent of Man or Evolution in Relation to Sex and in this book Darwin established a principle , which a which at the time he was widely criticized and ridiculed and this was the principle of female choice .
190828:69	I do n't know what you think about this , but what occurs to me is this , supposing you had to kill somebody with your bare hands , how would you do it ? suggestion .
190872:136	In fact this is more interesting than you may think because female hyenas have a pseudo-penis , they have , they have a pseudo-scrotum and a pseudo-penis , reasons which are n't fully understood and in order to mate , the male has to insert his real penis into the female pseudo-penis in order to reach her her genital and it 's a bit complicated .
190873:245	So if the female does n't want it and this one clearly does n't , she just sits down and if she sits on her pseudo-penis , there 's no way the male is ever gonna get into her , but in fact this is true er in , in general terms of er if you think about it a , a female quadrupedal mammal I mean it looks like male domination , the male mounts and it looks as if she has to submit but she does n't .
190874:9	All she has to do is to walk away , he ca n't walk cos his fore legs are on her back back legs are on the ground .
190876:197	I remember making this point a couple of years ago , yeah I made this point last year and I showed these pictures , I spent about twenty minutes on it , the following week I was , I was libelously accused and it was a libel , it was a serious libel erm er that I , that I said that females always had to submit erm I was very angry about that .
190878:182	laugh , unfortunately you ca n't erm ca n't erm when I was giving this similar lecture two or three years ago , erm there was er a student in the class she put up her hand she said yes , she said that 's absolutely right she said , what you 're saying about the female does n't have to submit she said I used to work as a , as a stable maid at Newmarket at a stud farm and she said er you 've gotta have five people for er er to cover a mare .
190889:52	er in other words what I 'm saying is that erm a woman does n't have to accept a fertilized er egg once it 's been fertilized .
190903:54	Another example of that for instance , and this is something we 'll , we 'll have to wait a full explanation of this we 'll have to wait a little bit later itself .
190903:86	Another example of that for instance , and this is something we 'll , we 'll have to wait a full explanation of this we 'll have to wait a little bit later itself .
190909:21	Why they discriminate against males must wait .
190955:109	At the very least this theory about post-natal depressions shows it 's not that simple , the mother has a self-interest as well as the offspring and our modern insight into parental investment theory shows us that we have to take every individual 's self-interest seriously we 're not committing th the , the crude errors of group selectionism and saying you know mothers exist for the benefit of society to have children , they should put up with it .
190963:133	As I said at the beginning I think one should be wary about using the word natural , because sometimes people use it you know to promote something you know like on advertising you know it 's natural , must be good for you , but at the same time there are certain things that are natural that are very bad for you like death and if I were to say you know death is natural , nobody would think I was advocating suicide of course not .
190970:111	Well possibly and less likely to enjoy it , I mean I 've made a complete failure of my life , so I 'm , I 'm not and I never really enjoyed from the beginning I must say
190991:101	I think it 's unscientific , prejudicial and subjective to use it in a term that carries any kind of recommendation or erm disapprobation and er I think , I think one has to exercise caution in erm in the way you use tha tha that , that term , perhaps it 's better not to , not to use it at all .
191040:39	Now if you 've done a prisoner 's dilemma you do n't have to come .
191067:105	For example , er , males are fitter than females , er human males , in the sense of sporting achievement and this is why all sporting events that we rely on athletic prowess have to be segregated .
191081:265	Erm , the facts are , and this is all in Trivers if you want to look up erm if you want to look it up in more detail , that males die more readily than females , from all causes that affect both sexes and some that even do n't and you 'd be astonished about , like for instance , you gather from John book on the myth of he heterosexual you 're not allowed to buy in this country , you have to import it from the U S .
191108:15	Of course , organisms have to survive and may need to be , to have erm fitness in the sporting sense in order to have reproductive success .
191188:47	Because it reproduces inside another cell in this parasitic way , erm , it does n't have to find a mate or even bother to split in half to reproduce by asexual means .
191211:120	Had Darwin known about this you see Darwin could have turned on his critics and said , look , in the first place you 're quite wrong about genetics , there is no or at least there does n't have to be because mutations occur as errors or changes in the base sequences in , in the genetic code .
191216:82	Since erm sexually reproducing organisms are and I 've tried to keep technical jargon in this course to a minimum , but one term we 'll have to learn is diploid , you ca n't do without it .
191236:49	I was hoping not to mention this , but since raised it , we 'll have to .
191287:30	Supposing we start off with , erm , we had to explain the origins of cooperation .
191293:15	By definition the gene must promote the reproductive success of the selfish organisms at a cost to itself but a gene for altruism could evolve in a population of selfish individuals a population of altruists , in whom a gene for selfishness appears by random mutation .
191294:19	By definition , the altruistic majority must promote the reproductive success of the selfish the reproductive success of the selfish organism , the mutant , will be far greater than the altruist , and within a few generations of selfish individuals .
191306:28	Yes , in terms of this definition it has to be because that 's the only , that 's the bottom line of evolution , and it 's the only quantitative measure we can ever have , it 's the only When you 're ready , there 's no hurry .
191423:99	You would just say things that pop in to you mind and er it 's essential of course , if you 're gonna do dream analysis properly , that you must obey that rule .
191429:19	You do , and you have to assume it 's right , whatever comes up .
191430:7	You have to assume it 's correct .
191432:102	I mean , I 've been analyzing every dream I can remember now for the last twenty one years and er I think I 've got rather good at dream interpretation I must admit .
191433:50	Erm , but even today er with every dream the same feeling comes and you just have to resolutely ignore it and say well , you know , that 's what I thought .
191485:208	It 's only when you pursue the associations with the manifest content and ask yourself what does that make me think of , that you start to think of things that you then realize leads to a latent content , which may be sexual in , in , in nature , but why er , even if , as Theresa rightly says , we d we have to say it 's crude and misrepresentational for that all , all , all dreams are about sex .
191602:21	Is it necessary that you had to have had some kind of fantasy before
191608:26	Well you see , what Freud had to explain here was how he could have had such a long dream when the dreamer reported that he woke up more or less instantly from the stimulus of something hitting him on the back of the neck .
191620:9	and I had to make sure I did n't eat them because they were so comfortable .
191645:10	You 'll have to have another go in your dreams Theresa .
191646:48	Well now you , now you 've had a class on it , you 'll have to go back to it refreshed and try and crack it .
191679:26	No , that 's the tutorial , it must be much later than that .
191680:66	Sorry , I 'm reading the wrong dates here That 's right , it ca n't be the twelfth , I must have meant the fourteenth .
191773:83	Erm , er , Jim is , Jim is sitting on in er on the flight deck of the Enterprise and he is the guy who has to make all the decisions .
191775:15	Poor old Jim always has to make the decision because he is in command , okay ?
191777:21	And that 's what the ego has to do .
191778:191	The ego , as says , is open to the outside world and furthermore to stimulations from inside , from inside the body , that reach it through subjective sensations like hunger when you need food , or fear when something threatens you , and cognitive er awareness like er okay you realize that before you have your lunch you 're gonna have to go to the bank to get some money to pay for it .
191807:46	So this is a major complication and I think this shows why Freud had to introduce this second model of the mind , because in his first model of the mind it was very simple and repression was the force that distinguished conscious from unconscious .
191815:42	The but is the superego is a part of the ego so we have to er before we go on to the superego , let 's just say for the time being that repression is directed by the ego itself .
191830:24	Th that 's the thing you must remember .
191870:53	And Anna Freud said , okay that 's what you called it , but supposing we had to look what you 've just described up in a dictionary , what word would be found ?
191889:18	I think what we have to say is that the term unconscious is , is still used by Freud of course , and is still very useful , and it , it describes er if you like erm a relationship between levels of consciousness .
191897:29	And this is confusing , I mean I must admit it is confusing and even , even s writers in the psychoanalytic literature get confused by this , because sometimes they , they er do n't see that to some extent the two systems are overlapping and to some extent they 're about di slightly different things .
191943:36	Now , if you 're charged with managing anything , you have to make decisions and when you have to make a decision , you ca n't have your cake and eat it .
191943:60	Now , if you 're charged with managing anything , you have to make decisions and when you have to make a decision , you ca n't have your cake and eat it .
191946:38	In a real world where you face managerial decisions and you have to make a decision , you can do one thing or a number of other things , but you ca n't do them all at once , it 's just not possible .
191949:33	The id is not a managerial agency , it does not have to make decisions , it is not in contact with the real world and therefore it can have its cake and eat it .
191954:34	If , however , you get elected and you then have to carry out your policies , then of course you face the real world and the you ca n't have your cake and eat it problem .
191971:19	And of course the ego has to do that , I mean if you 're gonna stay alive , the ego has to take account of these internal demands .
191971:69	And of course the ego has to do that , I mean if you 're gonna stay alive , the ego has to take account of these internal demands .
191972:65	The difference between the ego and id however is that if that is gonna happen in the real world , there has to be a cake there for you to eat .
191993:82	You know , very often Jim does things on the Enterprise he does n't want , want to do you know , but he just has to do them unfortunately .
192022:27	Guilt is the prime means that the superego has to punish the ego and er as says , guilt , you can be made to feel guilty by external agencies , by other people , but we also know you can also be made to feel guilty by yourself .
192051:80	I mean we all live in a society where people wear clothes and we 'd probably feel a bit ashamed if we did n't have to wear any , but if you grew up in a society where nobody wears clothes , you would n't , would n't bother about it for one moment .
192125:7	We must stop .
192130:19	Apologies for those who had to sit on plastic seats .
192133:109	So what I intend to do from this week is that very thing , try and fill in as it were and er make up for what was n't covered in the classes because I must admit that this year I 've been struck by the high st high standard of the class presentations .
192134:28	So far anyway they 've been excellent I must say .
192213:15	When you actually have to do it , you discover that there are all kinds of problems with it in practice , but in principle the , the situation I think is completely clear .
192255:56	And he , erm , in fact puts in a greater investment than she does because he has to do the transportation , protection and everything .
192256:7	He has to oxygenate them inside him and everything else .
192296:35	For that statement to be anything but trivial , there would have to be situations in which an individual was faced with a choice between an act which would promote its own reproductive success and that wou wou would injure its reproductive success , but promote that of the group , shall we say by foregoing eating something , by not fighting with another member of the group , by not mating with a female , whatever it may be .
192330:39	I 'm afraid sex ratio theory is complicated , but you 'll have to take it from me that Fisher solved the problem by showing that it would never be an individual self-interest .
192432:32	Th the modern scientific view of evolution says you must treat all individuals equally because all individuals are equally just the temporary packaging for their genes .
192435:27	The consequence of that is , you have to ask yourself , okay , oedipal behaviour is fine for sexy sons them , but what about daughters ?
192442:52	So all I 'm arguing is that all such a gene for penis envy would have to do would be to promote the reproductive success of the little girls who 've had it to that gene eventually to become established throughout the entire female population , just as the gene for oedipal behaviour , or phallic behaviour , would become selective in males .
192455:121	I mean , let 's face it , penis envy is a is a pretty wacky idea however you look at it , and you ca n't blame people for thinking , oh you know , this Viennese professor must have had a , had a diseased mind or something to come across such a crazy idea .
192514:74	Pessimistic in the sense that is says people are basically nasty , and if society is to be possible , then nastiness has to be controlled in some way or other , and since human nature is anti-social , social order comes about against the grain of human nature as a rule , has to be imposed on human nature .
192514:162	Pessimistic in the sense that is says people are basically nasty , and if society is to be possible , then nastiness has to be controlled in some way or other , and since human nature is anti-social , social order comes about against the grain of human nature as a rule , has to be imposed on human nature .
192517:209	And I think you can see why I call it pessimistic because , basically it says in the Anglican prayer book , there is no good in us , what 's in us is , is bad , in the sense of anti- social egoistic , and if people are going to cooperate and if there 's gonna be social order , then as it were , it has to be imposed on them .
192518:11	The good has to be imposed from outside , it 's not , it 's not in human nature .
192609:18	The thing that you have to obey , if you do n't obey you will be punished .
192619:34	This is a this is a paradox that Freud has to face up to .
192620:80	And in the closing pages of the book , he answers this this er , problem , by saying , well look , er , you do n't have to base morality , civilization , and social order on an illusion .
192670:44	If you look at all Freud 's writings , I think what you have to say is , if you want to say that , you must make the qualification that the id is a Hobbesian erm , thing as it were , but the ego is a pro-social erm , part of the personality .
192670:87	If you look at all Freud 's writings , I think what you have to say is , if you want to say that , you must make the qualification that the id is a Hobbesian erm , thing as it were , but the ego is a pro-social erm , part of the personality .
192682:136	This was , this is what I call an optimistic view , and this was Rousseau 's view of human nature , that basically people were good , and er , cooperative , and it was the bad things in human nature that had to be explained , not the good .
192700:52	They see the child as basically a , a little animal , a wild animal , who has to be tamed , and er , disciplined and controlled by er , various means , and er , this is the , I think the view of the child that was more popular in British education , at least traditional education , which erm , for the public schools of Eton , which in this country was based on er , on er brutality , I think there 's the only word you can call it .
192703:43	But anyway , the idea that the brutality is er justified , and you have to beat the hell out of little kids because er , if you do n't you wo n't civilize them .
192704:70	This goes , I think you can see , with the pessimistic view , the Hobbesian view , that for civilization order has to be , has to be imposed .
192704:82	This goes , I think you can see , with the pessimistic view , the Hobbesian view , that for civilization order has to be , has to be imposed .
192718:95	The Audrey Hepburns in this world , may not be as numerous , unfortunately , as the people running around in Bosnia , or er Somalia , but they do exist , and you have to see that there are both of these sides of human nature .
192753:22	They tend to say we must overthrow the existing social order and establish a new just social order , when human beings will be liberated from the corrupting erm , alienating er forces , that er , make them bad , and everything will be , everything will be okay .
192759:35	Well , at that point I will end what I have to say for today , and er , carry on with this next week .
192801:18	Look , we 're gonna have to stop .
192826:88	Er , as I have said , I have n't done Woodrow Wilson before in the past , so , so it was an experiment , and erm , I must admit , yo you rose to the occasion excellently .
192845:22	This country was bankrupt , and had to borrow money from the United States of America to keep going , and er , Russia had just had a revolution and was still in chaos .
192848:49	So , that would be Freud 's defence , now , I suppose you would have to know a lot more about modern history , to , to know , if this was really true or not , but erm , the the er , question that Freud was really asking himself , really was , why did Wilson let us down , because Freud admits that he regarded Wilson , when he came to Europe as a saviour .
192909:110	So it 's quite an interesting , whatever you think about Woodrow Wilson in the First World War is quite a interesting book , in drawing a character study of the kind of person who Freud must have seen many times in his practice .
192912:9	So Freud has to explain this weakness of Wilson , in the face of erm , these much more dominant aggressive men he was up against in these very hard er hitting negotiations , about what to do about the world after , after World War One .
192945:102	I said , you know , I 'd every right to resume my own research , erm , if the Labour Party thought it owned psychoanalysis , I 'm afraid I have , have to differ .
192949:12	Erm , it must have vanished , there was a copy there .
192950:85	Er , so it 's , it , it 's one of these strangely anomalous works , it , it 's , it has spawned , I must admit , some very unfortunate literature , and I think ' s own book is the worst example , but it 's not the only one .
192953:69	There 's a whole school of psycho- history mainly in the United States , not many followers here , and er , I must admit , I , I used to have er a class on psycho-history on this course , and I dropped it , and the reason was , I think students did n't find it very satisfactory , and the literature was of such poor quality .
192973:10	We 'll have to wait and see .
192979:99	And er , one of the big scientific problems with psychoanalysis is that privacy and confidentiality are prominent , as obviously in other areas of science , you can er , the demonstration has to be in public , as it were .
193005:19	My guess is , he must have written an account .
193035:23	A certain fourteen points for cruci everybody must have that .
193079:13	Er , I must admit I point Freud makes , slightly arrogant erm , I mean it , he 's , he 's , he 's a
193103:20	Well , one year , I must admit , somebody in the class stormed out .
193140:24	Yeah , the reason is , we have to discuss your erm , your reports and so on .
193155:31	Yeah , the trouble with that , I 'll have to make you wait till four thirty , is that too long ?
193220:26	She said , now , supposing you had to look up what you just described , you know , in a dictionary , and find a word that everybody would associate with it .
193257:12	Well , I must say I liked it , er , I mean , I showed it because er suggested it .
193311:12	Yeah , I have to .
193422:100	Er , back to the profit and analysis er remind you so far there 's three which er you 're all very I 'm sure already familiar with but we have to explain to some of our less sophisticated audiences .
193454:155	As you 've heard we 've been cutting costs pretty significantly over the last couple of years erm what we 're talking about is three thousand people having been er made redundant over the two and a half years and as we were saying earlier substantial redundancy costs have had to be borne .
193471:132	Er I think in this context strength to strength is talking about market share , erm Frank er was saying how we 've made considerable gains in relation to the opposition and er such an extent that in fact er it had to join up with the er er er with the other financial newspaper , but Frank would you , would you like to add ?
193616:170	The , the U K pension charge will er er er go up to the extent that pensionable salaries go up , there 's a standard surplus being amortized au fait gently rising pension , I mean there 's obviously there 's an X percent of pensionable salaries is what the will tell you will have to provide and er er not much more at the moment er therefore the charge will go up a little bit but not , not gradually and it 's not much .
193628:7	Mr must have been very austere with his colleagues or
193639:23	I have n't got er I have to give you the figure afterwards erm no I have got it , I have got it .
193706:17	On the other hand it has to be said that the er publicity for that does not seem to have penetrated very far amongst foreign visitors and there is n't very much evidence that foreign visitors have been put off coming here in spite of the considerable number of incidents that there have been in this country , particularly in London of course in the last year or so .
194922:20	I did , you 'll have to forgive me , I mean I think for the sake of those who were not at the meeting erm what we should really say is that actually said that he wanted to hear what kind of a parish we are so that he could attempt to match the , the incoming priest with you know the need of the parish .
194948:15	He wanted we had to tell him you know basically .
194951:17	I mean , he had to once or twice correct the emphasis of what he was saying .
195063:12	Yes , I have to say I enjoyed it far more than I expected .
195074:9	Well we had to discuss on the way home in the car that it would be better to have parish council meetings during the day rather than the evening .
195088:114	You know , so , I mean , in a way , it 's more for a new parish council coming together erm you know , perhaps one of the , the most important things we have to learn is that it 's , it is difficult to be very specific because you know we 're not an action committee .
195101:51	Well , that 's , yes and to some extent I think even the general meeting has to be fairly focused .
195118:26	Is this the only response we 've had to that article ?
195139:104	Yes , you 've got to have a certain degree of structure in it and that happens I think through the parish council in a number of the key areas , but you have got to retain a degree of flexibility , otherwise you will just stifle initiative , you 'll stifle growing issues that happen .
195189:76	No , no but I mean , th there 're so many issues that we are trying to get to grips with we have to actually communicate it to people and say well this is
195199:12	which I must say I certainly in that a parish council is it , and everybody else is linked in at lower levels .
195201:13	Now , we have to get over to people this changed idea , and it has n't been got over because nobody that I 've listened to , or talked to , knows , in fact people say , what does the parish council do ?
195203:51	So , first of all , the method of dealing with things in such a changed manner has to be put over to people and I think the links , which were traditional , which no longer apply , have to be and it must be a link going out in directions like this .
195203:125	So , first of all , the method of dealing with things in such a changed manner has to be put over to people and I think the links , which were traditional , which no longer apply , have to be and it must be a link going out in directions like this .
195203:141	So , first of all , the method of dealing with things in such a changed manner has to be put over to people and I think the links , which were traditional , which no longer apply , have to be and it must be a link going out in directions like this .
195204:66	Now , you can have it by the written word and the spoken word , but I think the links we must continually have all the time are personal links , talking to people .
195206:145	You stand a better chance if you put something with the Sunday and even then that might not be completely enough to reach down to the crevices , but I think some method , and that 's why I suggested surgeries actually , was that we have to talk regularly to people face to face and once you 're in a room with people then it goes , does n't it ?
195222:46	If you 're in an organization and you 're leader , you , you have to encourage them .
195235:60	I think that 's very important and I think it 's , there 's er actually , I have to say er I detect in ' s letter because I am quite sure that a year ago she would have questioned the parish council 's existence , and indeed she 's being , erm , to my perception , highly critical of er the fact that the parish council has even dared to sort of taste the oxygen outside their own homes .
195284:9	but I must admit it 's up to each person that organizes it to say that , great , we do n't need the collectors .
195323:12	Er , I must n't be guilty of commercials but in the last council meeting of the night , again the subject came up of how we could welcome people coming to mass and this is nothing to do with a request council at all and er we ended up , and I think it 's fair to say what we decided er here , that people would individually they did n't know approach them .
195370:114	One of the reasons is because the Law Society says you 've got to have advocacy skills , and you 'll find in your manual the actual amount or degree of advocacy skills you will eventually have to learn .
195416:80	Erm but we wo n't , well we 're not going to be descriptive , we 're not going to ask say that you must wear suits or you must whatever .
195416:95	Erm but we wo n't , well we 're not going to be descriptive , we 're not going to ask say that you must wear suits or you must whatever .
195453:112	The other thing to remember , you 're trying to persuade the court to your views , or the view that you 're putting forward for your client , you 're not telling the court what they must think .
195455:19	If somebody says you must think this , the only way of doing it is , that 's not going to be persuasive .
195505:13	He 'd then had to drive back down to Harlow again the following morning to sort out further problems with the system .
195521:103	And Madam , I 'd also ask you to say that to to him to pay compensation for the minor injuries she 's suf she 's suffered and of course you have to consider that 's a point in a case involving assault , would be to add insult to injury , and would not assist the parties in coming to terms with their relationship and hopefully attempting a reconciliation .
195523:47	If you can get it as good as that your first time up you must be a natural .
195685:37	So they 're not out of pocket , they do n't have to keep two homes going .
195802:26	You 've Radio York all week , they must have been over er over overwhelmed for callers I imagine this week , I would have thought you would have been a boon to anybody 's talk show .
195855:26	I 'm a pensioner , and er I have to exist on a very very low
195880:46	He could n't manage it and he said that he felt that he had to stop being an M P er for several reasons , one of them was that he thought most M Ps like he agreed he was at certain times , were out of touch .
195887:15	If every pensioner I have to I I do n't want to I mean I a I do n't want people to think I 'm m m too much of an anarchist .
195894:99	Exactly and if you do n't pay it , and there are a few silly old so and sos not paying it at the moment , I mean the rest of us have had to pa
195895:33	Er well that 's another thing you see we have to pay it
195918:30	I 'm always crossing my fingers , I 'll have to be careful about that .
195921:30	I mean I I I s I have to I say it myself occasionally , I stop very quickly because I realize that
195928:64	Why I I I can because I I saved a little bit , and I 'm I h I had to keep going on my savings .
195985:30	That is a pig of a road , I must admit , I do n't know why they do n't make it into a dual carriage way .
196097:94	Cos I have n't said that my M P can have a pay rise , and as I vote for my M P , and you vote for your M P , they have to ask us first as far as I 'm concerned .
196108:47	The thing the thing about M Ps is they they think erm You have to be fairly careful because I I spend quite a lot of time interviewing M Ps and I I think that er er they 're quite interesting some of the time to talk to .
196115:91	And and and in the sort of business that a lot of M Ps , or people that become M Ps , and the sort of Mm er way they have to l It may not be a lot of money , and maybe they are entitled to some more .
196154:83	Now the N S P C C has er warned us of possible Halloween danger and er David I I missed your name there David so you 'll have to remind me what your name is .
196162:11	You 'll have to bear with me David , I think you 're only the second person I 've ever had , if you 'll excuse the expression , in this studio .
196250:16	you know , people have got to realize that this day and age er children are taught not to talk to strangers
196367:35	delivered daily do n't you I 'm going to have to go my lunch is on the table .
196392:7	It must
196394:7	It must be difficult .
196412:27	Well you better erm no no no I must n't be seen to encourage that sort of thing .
196653:14	Oh that that must be a bit galling for you , really , John .
196723:23	Of all the things the Welsh M Ps have got to talk about they decided public toilets are the most important .
196780:7	I have to say something like hang on just one minute erm I have to pull this faded down do n't I go B B C Radio York the station that 's always first for travel .
196780:48	I have to say something like hang on just one minute erm I have to pull this faded down do n't I go B B C Radio York the station that 's always first for travel .
196941:32	that they did n't enjoy it and therefore it must have been rape cos they did n't wa they did n't like it .
196958:33	It 's very annoying but that 's when you have to stop .
196959:12	but you do have to stop but that is n't to say it is n't very annoying .
196975:34	But as you say you at that point you do have to stop .
196982:9	but there has to be a time when no is no .
196983:7	Just have to avoid being intimidated .
197014:10	Well you must be one of the very few I would have thought Mark .
197095:10	I 'll have to go .
197105:16	He added , I have to pass a sentence because it is against the law .
197194:28	Yes but I think you know you have to give
197196:7	You have to give a little bit of er credibility there for people not being quite that dim do n't you ?
197274:26	Er but the basis of what he had to say is presents a problem which do face judges in the class of case .
197279:40	Well the men although they may not have realized they were thirteen must have been pretty stupid not to realize they were perhaps below consent age .
197307:75	But that that 's the problem that we all have This is one of the problems that the ju burdens that the judge has to bear .
197456:91	Yes that they are beginning a process involving both governments and er naturally er I welcome that very much , because I think the attention of both governments would have to be concentrated on this terrible problem , and of course if they take the trouble to read the statement that Mr Addams and I issued that 's precisely what we said , that the two governments should begin a process involving all parties .
197457:18	So what else do you have to offer then ?
197463:46	Because er it 's a that 's that 's just the way it has to be for the present , at the end of the
197466:33	At the end of the day the whole community has to know what this is all about , but let me stress , there is no threat in this process that is being proposed , to bring about a total cessation of violence , there is no threat to any section of our community , none what so ever .
197479:175	I am saying Mr Major , as Prime Minister , if someone in my position is saying I believe , I believe , there is the best opportunity here for lasting peace , by which I mean a total cessation of violence , the least I expect is that you should listen to what I have to say .
197490:176	Well i I 'm not aware of how far he has taken anything on board , what I would expect as a Member of Parliament and the House of Commons , and as the leader of a party in the House of Commons , I would expect that he would want to hear what I would have to say face to face , and tell me face to face what 's wrong with what I have said .
197548:161	So Mr MacGregor 's hard work may yet come to grief , even if he sorts that problem out there 's another obstacle to privatization running smoothly , many on the railways think the private sector will need a generous subsidy before they 'd be interested , if their not attracted the state will have to spend more to make the new structure work , a lot more .
197570:45	No , well the key point is the key point is that they they have to have a period during which they have a track record of running those separate businesses , so that bidders will know the basis on which their bidding , now if if the franchising director , it 's entirely his decision , decides that er he 's not getting competitive enough bids or good enough bids , then yes British Rail would carry on , and this was clear right from the outset , would carry on running that particular
197675:31	What your group 's quote , not mine , well must tell them then , will you go in tomorrow morning and say redo this working paper ?
197717:217	Well I think it 's it 's a hiccup , nothing more , but I think the trend is clearly established , and it 's very much agreed , it 's recognized in the Labour Party , that the world outside has changed , women are now half the workforce , women are now half the college and university graduates , women 's work now represents forty percent of our G D P , so we have to increase women 's representation to recognize the world has changed .
197723:82	no , because the point is that Labour has not changed it 's course , which is recognizing that at the heart of it 's policies we have to show that we know the world has changed , and we 've got a message to women , which is that we know that you are essential in your role in the family , but we know you 're also essential in the economy ,
197744:17	No , what we have to look at is not the labels which are attached to each individuals , but say do we have
197752:44	Well I think people think that a certain amount of time and attention has to be devoted to the Party 's constitution , and there are two things that arose out of the conference in Brighton .
197776:63	Really , he says , people do n't notice V A T so much , others believe income tax will have to take some of the strain , but not by putting up the rates , that would be too blatant .
197829:83	But i it grew slowly over the weeks and I think Christmas was an example of just the actual logistics of what we did at Christmas must be something of a feat in that so much stuff came in from the volume of presents and then the way in which they could be distributed .
197832:72	And we had our hiccups and we had all sorts of you know difficult moments for all of us where we all had to face ourselves and You know I remember my little boy said , Oh Mum y what about my Christmas you know I was putting a lot of time into the the striker 's Christmas and he said how do you become a striker 's child ?
197839:69	So the meetings are packed really with organizing and trying you know democratically to decide who we 're going to have to speak and the balance of speakers and er where we 're going to march from and who 's gonna invite the band and who 's gonna do this and who 's gonna do that you know .
197856:46	Oh yes obviously er there is that element there always is and you have to out weigh I think you know creating sub committees that then er .
197877:125	So it is I I I wo n't predict you know how it 's gonna be too much you know because obviously er it 's just the day to day living is quite difficult for most people have to work and cope with their families and you know so there 's not going to be er that the fundamentals are are not gonna be changed and obviously people are gonna be very broke for a long time because in a strike situation you probably do n't ever really quite recover .
197881:15	You know they must be you know and a certain amount of guilt maybe that they that they did n't support the miners or you know it was something that was happening far away and maybe y like I said you gave the odd tin of beans you know but er
197900:45	You know it 's a sort of what 's got to be has got to be in a sense I mean there 's no going back now there 's no surely finally every every strike is settled in the end and they 've got to come and talk .
197901:40	Everybody 's got to sit down and talk eventually and something has got to be worked out and that 's got to happen we know that .
197904:39	And if if it does start dropping we 're gonna have to change our tactics and go and do something else you know we 'll we 'll knock on anybody 's doors do you know what I mean w we 're not proud and we 'll go you know we 'll just change our tactics and er whatever it takes .
197913:89	Is there any hint that you might be forced to make an inver an inversion o in that sense that er you would be able so that you would have to make statements like that as you 've made you you 've turned them that the employer 's statement on it 's head ?
197924:39	I mean all this sitting on the fence I mean they must have very sore bums .
197928:75	You know they they 're a lot of the older men makes you wonder have they been sacked so they do n't have to pay them hand shakes at the end you know if they wanted to lay some people off .
197954:114	Obviously at the moment we we all of us are really tied up with living from a Tuesday to a Saturday really you know with Tuesdays our meeting and then all that has to be done after that and then Saturday is the food parcels you know so and most people work as well either part time or full time work at home er with the kids and bringing up families so and obviously also money is shor short for people that are directly involved in the strike so erm .
197979:65	Well I dunno whether I I 'm in a position to comment on that you know you 'll have to ask them about that whether you know we 've all learnt from each other really .
198024:29	sort of in conjunction with that , that has to go you know i has to be tied in with a bonus contract that suits the workforce .
198024:52	sort of in conjunction with that , that has to go you know i has to be tied in with a bonus contract that suits the workforce .
198058:16	I suppose there must have been but I ca n't remember .
198167:18	I think certainly we had to have a figurehead to relate to and in my opinion , Tom was the best one to have there .
198297:7	Britain must be an animal erm a country of animal abusers looking at the statistics .
198299:85	If you have a view on that O nine O four six four one six four one and I 'd like to hear from you all you have to do is pick up the phone and give me a f a call now sorry .
198307:23	The R S P C A have to pick up the pieces and they 've launched a campaign to try and stop it and joining me now is Alan .
198346:130	Yes it 's it 's it was one of the er advertisements or programmes that went out on radio er again this is why I 've been trying to get over to people the sad things that have to happen to animals .
198426:30	Okay well er I I figure that there must be quite a number of er extraterrestrials around around North Yorkshire and I thought it would be quite nice actually if er if there are any extraterrestrials listening at the moment they could ring in and we could have a chat .
198529:71	Okay now er Garth Brookes my favourite country singer at the moment and er your chance to win this Elvis video okay you have to ring in we 're giving this away first you have to ring in and tell me and tell me the next word no I ca n't do that I ca n't no I ca n't do it 's too easy okay .

198531:81	There were three words in the do n't ring yet there were three words in the title I 'll give you two you have got to give me the last one .
198546:65	Oh that 's good I could n't you see it 's very difficult for me you know I have to look up there I can never distinguish one one one call from another .
198577:54	Well I think it 's er down to the competitive tendering process where the County Council has had to put out the cleaning contracts for schools to tender .
198615:41	Decisions are made decisions are made erm there that we and we have to live with the consequences of them .
198618:58	Who was tha who was that oh for goodness sake tall thin gaunt looking man , always had to have about fifteen spoonfuls of sugar in his coffee whenever I met him ?
198670:90	Where are you calling from we 're very loud with callers today I know I 'm not the most exciting thing on radio but you know there must be some callers out there somewhere ?

199522:14	Oh no but you had to because you felt that sort of there there was that bit between you and me was n't there ?
199779:24	He 's gone he 's probably had to serve somebody .
199795:55	What hang on just a minute sorry ca n't I ca n't hear you you 'll have to speak up I ca n't hear a word Karen lives in Tadcaster oh oh another another another place to avoid really is n't it yes yeah .

199895:74	It 's er you know it 's completely okay to take and stop taking it , and you wo n't want to have to go on .
199961:92	About ten people a day kill themselves by suicide , maybe maybe one in a thousand people who take Prozac get bad reactions to it , but that has to be seen in balance , in the balance of a large number of people deriving a lot of benefit and maybe a few people having some bad reactions .
200075:35	Th about a quarter of people do unfortunately and they have to stop taking it .
200163:12	You did n't have to take it .
200171:15	psychiatric hospitals , there must have been something wrong with you .

200297:63	I 've taken eight antidepressants over the last ten years , Prozac has n't been one of them I must admit .
200365:18	Yo first of all you must distinguish Northern Ireland from other ar territories in the world where there has been terrorism .
200472:27	Now my , I mean I would have to say , I mean very clearly , that they 're inseparable .
200477:36	Is the Republican Movement the I R A , I would have to say logically of course it 's the I R A .
200479:10	You 'd have to say of course he 's a director of that company .
200492:14	But the intern I have to say this , this is I R A .
200549:12	And really it has to be said and has to be said historically that I mean the army in a way was left with a job which politicians should have sorted out before it got to that stage .
200549:28	And really it has to be said and has to be said historically that I mean the army in a way was left with a job which politicians should have sorted out before it got to that stage .
200551:12	We 're gonna have to
200556:59	Well come on , they know who they are , they know who they are , they must do
200615:9	No we must er abide by the rule of law , as we always have done , as our trad as our traditions demand and as most of the people in this room I 'm sure in their hearts would wish to .
200706:105	If you take the British army out of Northern Ireland tonight , the U D A would clean up , you would have real civil war , it would be worse than ever , we have to be thankful that catholics and protestants
200837:10	I do have to pay into circuses unfortunately erm because I go in as a member of the public to watch the act , and when I can , I pay the money to go
200883:25	Okay , that 's what the youngsters have to s , pardon me , that 's what the youngsters have to say , Dave are the animals , let 's pick from Diane now , are the animals little more than prisoners ?
200883:68	Okay , that 's what the youngsters have to s , pardon me , that 's what the youngsters have to say , Dave are the animals , let 's pick from Diane now , are the animals little more than prisoners ?
201031:20	That 's what the youngsters have to say .
201061:63	The membership issue now has the profile it deserves and demands at Table , Area and National levels and this must be continued .
201089:39	Er when I was young erm you know you did n't have to use dialect at all .
201308:11	Erm I must have gonna put yeah Do you think they 're being slapped down over dialect at school ?
201319:36	But if you really wanted to make an impression you had to get rid of this Orcadian fast .
201345:84	All the feeding stuff and there were a pile of feeding stuff then for the hens were all and cattle were fed and all the feeding stuff had to be imported .
201391:56	And the horses well they they 're the worst to ship some were really bad and they had to be severely tied .
201432:81	And it let an old house alongside with nothing in it and hardly a door on it and that stood right alongside of that one and it must have been like a comb it just must have gone in strips the gale for that house was now twelve foot away from the other one .
201432:107	And it let an old house alongside with nothing in it and hardly a door on it and that stood right alongside of that one and it must have been like a comb it just must have gone in strips the gale for that house was now twelve foot away from the other one .
201449:7	It must have done an awful lot of damage everywhere else too .
201458:9	And they had to import hay and straw and goodness knows what .
201459:11	Did the Council have to set up some sort of emergency system ?
201474:32	If you wanted to go to Kirkwall you had to cross to the Rousay pier and then either hire a car or walk to and get across with Tom .
201476:80	And we before that we made quite a few runs to Kirkwall with a that was a small one that we had and erm you had to get the bus from Evie of course to Kirkwall and back the same way .
201490:7	They had to go and collect the mails .
201499:7	We had to run direct to Kirkwall quite a lot then .
201523:7	It must be totally different now I I know that in places like Hoy that just used the freezers all the time .
201552:7	There must have been a big business even when the deep litter started cos I can remember the farm next door to us working a deep litter .
201588:15	Oh aye it must have done mhm .
201613:16	So this other wife tell had to go and steal some milk for the witch 's cow .
201626:42	The post office itself here is called Samson 's Lane , that must cause a lot of interest and people must be interested in getting a post mark from here .
201626:67	The post office itself here is called Samson 's Lane , that must cause a lot of interest and people must be interested in getting a post mark from here .
201628:29	And I suppose over the last twelve month we must have had as many as a dozen of such inquiries wanted their stamp franked .
201664:41	Then H P W R and if it lands on P you have to go really fast .
201665:12	The first person has to start skipping in the middle and everybody says H P W R and if it landed on P the next person would have to skip fast .
201665:83	The first person has to start skipping in the middle and everybody says H P W R and if it landed on P the next person would have to skip fast .
201667:10	You just have to do what it means like .
201671:71	Well somebody sa and they stand facing the wall and they shut their eyes and there 're people at the end and they have to try and get to the other side without the other person seeing them .
201725:38	A new motor car was for many a luxury that would have to wait for another day .
201753:10	Well it must have been a tough old crab because this did n't work either .
201767:24	However the one thing that you must never do is to go between a cow and her calf and I made this mistake one morning and I had to take to my heals and run .
201767:85	However the one thing that you must never do is to go between a cow and her calf and I made this mistake one morning and I had to take to my heals and run .
201802:61	Well I did think about it but the Careers Officer advised me no cos he thought that you have to be really really good before y get in and he asked me if I thought I was really good and I said that well I was not too bad but and he said that he thought it would be better to concentrate on something else .
201864:13	How long do have to get get the points ?
201971:9	Do you have to go quite far away to see all these things or could you see most of them on Shapinsay ?
201984:15	And it and we had to collect twenty cans and then when you 've collected twenty cans that is enough for one trees one tree and it is gonna be planted in Sherwood Forest and it 's going to stay there for hundreds and hundreds of years .
202125:77	Well tell us erm tell us about the payment and tell us what 's happening to you and what you 're gonna have to do .
202126:14	Well my husband 'll have to leave so I 'll claim income support and be as well off as his ex-wife .
202134:18	Well th we 'll have to split
202136:15	But he we 'll have to live apart , we 'll have to make us try and make our marriage work by living apart .
202136:37	But he we 'll have to live apart , we 'll have to make us try and make our marriage work by living apart .
202149:12	Why should they have to pay
202160:15	Everybody thought he must think first about the bringing up of the children
202162:17	and this couple over there must think first about the children
202274:68	has having enough opportunity to go off and make a second marriage , which I do n't deny them but they must accept their responsibilities .
202374:58	Because you see the Treasury it is who actually tries to see that other people do n't have to pay for someone else 's responsibilities if they 're not justified .
202402:22	the costs which the father has to pay rise and our law says that
202480:26	How many cases do you as one barrister have to deal with at the moment ?
202508:7	You must be the only M P in the country that has n't had fathers coming to you .
202544:21	Theresa I 'm going to have to stop you and I 'm going to have stop you as well Sue and can I say that we 're going to need to wait and see what the Prime Minister has to say .
202544:122	Theresa I 'm going to have to stop you and I 'm going to have stop you as well Sue and can I say that we 're going to need to wait and see what the Prime Minister has to say .
202551:34	Stewart from Tamworth says I 'm on the dole and have to pay maintenance , Prince Charles should be doing the same .
202664:25	But is this not something you just have to put up with if you join the Army ?
202692:65	And the difference between being tough and responding rapidly to instruction and discipline and bullying is something that er you have to denote er i in this discussion tonight .
202753:13	somewhere and it has to come from the training .
202762:189	Let 's not go into the specifics of the court case just now David Lightbown , what I want to say to you , do you think it 's a case , some people might perhaps unjustifiably but they still would say that those people who are bullied are bullied because they are nonconformists and in the military one has to conform and many people
202777:15	why should I have to survive it ? my country too you know ,
202787:169	Now er w w with every respect , to say that he survived it is something of a crass statement , because I remember reading about him thinking is n't this country getting good that we can have a black guardsman , and I remember my own disappointment when I read that he had to leave the regiment .
202817:70	Sergeant Major , you 've been in the Army for about nigh on twenty years now , do you think that a soldier has to be able to cope with that sort of taunting and name calling when he 's on the streets of Belfast for example .
202820:17	on the streets , he has to react or or react in a manner that erm really when he 's on there , he does n't he does n't react to that particular incident that 's happening in front of him .
202821:11	He he must be taught that and he 's taught that through his training .
202826:101	If I was on the streets of Ireland now , and I 've been there many occasions and someone said to me , look at that Welsh get there , I would just have to take it .
202854:101	But the problem is the lower level at that , i i i it 's at the N C O level where complaints are made by soldiers and because the complaint has to be made through the regiment , then the the pressure is for the soldier to withdraw his complaint .
202887:72	Brigadier , life is er hard enough in the Army when you 're being toughened up for the sort of rigours you have to face on the streets of Belfast for example
202908:60	I I do n't I do n't I do n't have any more time , we 're just gonna have to leave it on that very er worrying note , but thanks all very much for taking part .
203036:17	What right does any individual have to tell other people what they should or should n't do ?
203043:41	I started losing mine when I was nineteen , and er I must say in answer to that gentleman 's
203054:75	Yeah , I wanna know , right , why do n't you just you know go bald you know normally , why do you have to hide it ?
203164:22	The truth is ladies you only have to touch a bald man and you light up like Blackpool Tower .
203226:8	I must add that we will not be producing daily summaries , er I think it 's a task which is a fairly daunting on and quite frankly , er they will not be produced in the sense At the end That they would not be available at the end of each day .
203285:49	It accepted that while there were arguments for a full scale review , the priority had to progress on an alteration which as quickly as possible , established the principle of a Greater York new settlement and progress on the greenbelt local plan .
203420:35	Yeah I mean I I would assume that there must be agreed death rates which everybody would accept as as as being applicable in projecting population .
203465:28	Er this is not to say , I must emphasize that we have discounted students in this migration assessment .
203503:18	Mr has er Our aim must be to identify what really matters .
203506:7	We must please be clear about those factors which actually matter , always bearing in mind that it is for the county council in the first instance and perhaps for the panel in the second instance , to take a decision about the suppression of past migration trends .
203586:54	They are a factor in the the housing market in North Yorkshire and I think that we have to take those into account when we are looking at vacancy rates through to two thousand and six .
203610:86	I think the issue as you rightly as Miss rightly put it , is the normal vacancy rate and is there any reason to suppose as the County Council must be supposing , that this shrinks to a degree .
203674:26	I would suggest to you that this must be an extraordinarily sens environmentally sensitive county if it cannot afford over fifteen years , to take an extra point one nine percent of its unconstrained land into development .
203752:18	I I think I must come back with the fact that I have n't denied we made made a mistake .
203800:68	The government guidance er in P G three makes it very clear now that it 's an issue we do have to address and if we do n't for land requirement .
203863:12	And so there must be an element of doubt over having updated from nineteen eighty one here to nineteen eighty nine .
203896:15	I m I must confess I 'm one of these simple folk who thought that once we got the nineteen ninety one census figures through then it would it would all start into place .
203951:32	Erm fifty five thousand e No sorry , I 'll have to look that up .
203967:12	No I 'll have to I 'll I 'll I 'm afraid I 'll have to withdraw that that that comment .
203967:50	No I 'll have to I 'll I 'll I 'm afraid I 'll have to withdraw that that that comment .
204024:89	Although we might try to decision method , the overall stress of the Secretary of State 's decision methods , as they affect North Yorkshire , is that there must be some limit er to migration largely for environmental considerations and indeed , the panel in nineteen eighty seven were very concerned that er migration would not be slowed quickly enough er in North Yorkshire .
204025:27	So the there is the County Council we must try er and moderate migration .
204102:7	I have to say that the boom of the nineteen eighties was something of a myth .
204114:38	P P G three e paragraph one , says the planning system must provide an adequate and continuous supply of land for housing .
204133:26	And this states erm that Its effectiveness erm must be must be considered as a long term rather than a short term objective .
204133:32	And this states erm that Its effectiveness erm must be must be considered as a long term rather than a short term objective .
204161:42	And the County Council 's consistently said to the West Yorkshire authorities , you must make provision for a range of sites in suitable locations to help draw er development that would othe otherwise come to North Yorkshire .
204168:15	I think we have to remind ourselves that that is thirteen years old and that circumstances have changed .
204188:39	But I 'm making the point , it does apply but it has to be justified .
204189:7	You have to justify the restraints that you make .
204271:17	But I think there must be I I would suggest to you that you sh you should request a discussion between the principle parties here to agree what allocations they 're taking , whether in adopted plans or proposed plans or previous plans and what windfalls .
204302:25	Very briefly , I think the County Council must consider what they 're going to do for conversions in windfalls .
204305:9	The exercise must be done and should have been done by now .
204327:10	We shall have to see what that contains .
204386:11	Erm I have to say that that these are largely my personal views of the member of the regional office , rather than obviously the Secretary of State at this stage in the proceedings .
204388:63	If you look at the strategic guidance for West and South Yorkshire , and I fully admit that we still have to see the erm the colour of regional guidance .
204404:14	Erm other people should have to make the same sacrifices .
204432:46	Erm forty six thousand figure we feel is acceptable in that we still have to make environmental releases in the greenbelt , but erm the net outward movement would not hinder our urban regeneration .
204435:18	I think it maybe has to be said that we we picked these figures , not because we wanted to talk about the figures , but simply to use them as for you to hang on to .
204442:7	It has to be said that the current U D P of Leeds makes er an a an allowance of migration of net out migration of just over about nine thousand three hundred per five year period .
204462:52	Well the lowest figure , erm we 've already got a level of commitment , we have to have three thousand de-allocations if that was the case , that does not seem to me to be correct .
204503:33	There 's a great air of uncertainty and erm we have to be very cautious about proposing housing numbers which mean there 'll be very few new sites , which will be the implication of forty one thousand two hundred .
204532:67	And I think to an extent those two are two ends of the seesaw and is a straight er choice that has to be made .
204580:14	Means that provision has to be .
204605:21	Cos I I think there must be a range .
204636:55	Er there 's with no evidence of an oversupply , my suggestion is that the decision you must be taking is to what degree do you assume er to what degree do you er recommend a reduction in migration rates .
204645:211	I think probably the County Council are in a better position than me er to to advise you as to whether that thirty one thousand commitment figure is true of not , but if it were the case , then I think , Yes I would agree that erm the train would stop very quickly , and in view of the situation that we 're now in , there would have to be a degree of future flexibility to allow for phased reduction in development over future years .
204684:12	You do n't have to do it now .
204714:65	Erm to deal with Mr ' s point about denying a problem of affordable housing , I think er he must n't have heard what I said properly , because I 've never sought to deny that there 's a ho a problem of access to housing .
204824:30	But as a general rule there w because it has to be negotiated , it would not be er supplied .
204837:25	That 's why we ourselves have had to take our own greenbelt land .
204911:12	Right I 'll have to check back against all the figures , if you can just give me a moment .
204912:13	I 'll just have to check back I 've seen the table in this particular format .
204984:31	So it seems to me the exercise not only must be done , for the purpose of calculating where we stand in supply terms , but actually has been done by the County Council in respect of Greater York .
204996:85	But if if if if you are saying that calculation of housing provision includes conversions , I 'm somewhat some guidance on how much provision will have to made from new built sites , and somebody 's going to have to make an intelligent assumption about how much is coming forward from conversions .
204996:123	But if if if if you are saying that calculation of housing provision includes conversions , I 'm somewhat some guidance on how much provision will have to made from new built sites , and somebody 's going to have to make an intelligent assumption about how much is coming forward from conversions .
204997:24	Well certainly the starting point for that must be to look at what has been happening in the past as evidence .
204998:24	But on top of that one must then look into the future , the future supply of such properties , and the future o er of a whole range of issues which may occur locally and which can only really be decided by the district councils in their local plan work .
205002:32	Er conversions are simply a different factor they will have to take into account .
205003:54	I do n't see any difference in principle simply that this is an additional point they will have to take in account in their their local plan preparation .
205054:14	Er clearly the we have to you have to make a judgement on this .
205054:23	Er clearly the we have to you have to make a judgement on this .
205065:31	Erm the the impression I 'm left with I must admit is that that that the cart has followed the horse if that 's right in that erm the environmental justification for the figures has been retrospective .
205157:75	Now by way of introduction to this , we had some deep thinking last night after we 'd concluded our discussion , and I have to preface what I 'm going to say , certainly for Mr ' s benefit that it 's the if question , the if question .
205160:82	If if it is considered that a new settlement is required to meet the housing provision in Greater York , then the first question that has to be asked is , is the criteria approach alone acceptable .
205162:171	If the answer is no , and here this is linked to the question of should the policy include specific guidance for the location of the settlement , and by specific guidance , it implies , should it be allocated to a particular district , then in order to do that , the panel feel that we would have to be in a position of having sufficient information to make an objective and logical decision on that .
205199:98	It may be fortuitous that if we spend this morning discussing criteria , there 'll then be a gap of one and a half working days for those who do n't have to travel far to consider possible answers to the second stream of the dialogue .
205209:12	Erm I must say I share Peter ' s view here that the er location of the new settlement , whether in general terms or by district , has not been through the public consultation process .
205216:109	However if as a consequence , of a panel recommendation or of their decision on a panel recommendation , the County Council decide to modify the deposited structure plan , there would of course at that stage have to be a public planning enquiry .
205223:9	One only has to look at the Shropshire structure plan in which I was involved last year , and the Department of the Environment in that case had allowed the facility for new settlement without locational criteria .
205239:40	And maybe at the end of the day , the County Council will have to come to a conclusion , after you 've made your general recommendations , with or without a location maybe th they will decide that having gone through a consultation exercise , they 're only course is to modify the proposals which would then have to be the subject of another E I P .
205239:179	And maybe at the end of the day , the County Council will have to come to a conclusion , after you 've made your general recommendations , with or without a location maybe th they will decide that having gone through a consultation exercise , they 're only course is to modify the proposals which would then have to be the subject of another E I P .
205241:49	Certainly that would be o o one scenario which I think the county will have to contemplate .
205271:40	Cos the if there is to be a proposal modification , that must inevitably be the subject of another examination in public .
205278:15	I mean that has to be dealt with through the development control processes .
205332:82	Er as you 've already heard , the Greater York authority have cooperated for a number of years in bringing forward new settlement proposals but erm I have to say that I I do agree it would be helpful if the panel were able to make a strategic recommendation in favour of one particular local authority .
205393:95	That I think is absolutely er fundamental erm to the issue , and because of the way the practically the the greenbelt local plan has been defined , that means it has to be practically outside the outer boundary of the greenbelt .
205414:14	Sorry I I have to cut across my advice to everybody else there .
205415:87	It does strike me though as a that A that one of the basic points is that if this is going in as structure plan guidance then we have to be satisfied that these are in fact criteria which can operate at the strategic level .
205503:67	Now my submission is not intended to be representation that the new settlement should be in the greenbelt and great weight must still be given to it 's protection .
205531:29	In my professional view , cos if the new settlement has to be in is ch is i has to be within the greenbelt then it 's better to go for peripheral development rather than have a new settlement in the first place .
205531:54	In my professional view , cos if the new settlement has to be in is ch is i has to be within the greenbelt then it 's better to go for peripheral development rather than have a new settlement in the first place .
205535:46	And obviously the new settlement is a very important sub-regional er planning proposal , and it must comply with the overwhelming run of sub-regional planning policy which is to avoid doing anything which would erm undermine the regeneration of West Yorkshire .
205546:50	And even looking at that one , erm erm the south west location , one would have to say that the increased accessibility erm which will shortly be afforded by the dualling of the northern section erm of the York outer relief road , er would increase the accessibility of areas to the north east of erm er of Greater York er to West Yorkshire .
205548:63	And it 's not going to be difficult and at the end of the day , someone is going to have to I suspect , and it would have to be members initially erm who would do that , as far as we see it .
205548:87	And it 's not going to be difficult and at the end of the day , someone is going to have to I suspect , and it would have to be members initially erm who would do that , as far as we see it .
205599:33	But well can we move on to two and I must confess erm I 'm not quite clear what is meant by this one .
205648:30	So I if I put that in , I must apologize for misleading the panel .
205706:97	Erm they are the crit the two criteria which I I consider alongi along with the greenbelt and the need to be located on a public transport corridor , which must be given the most weight in the in the decision making process .
205727:39	Certainly as far as South Yorkshire is concerned , again we would have to say that the linkage social soc socioeconomic linkage between Greater York a and South Yorkshire er is very limited .
205730:10	I I have to disagree with er Mr of , I think this criterion is crucially important and in fact what Peter has just said , reemphasises my view that er the important sub-regional and regional issue is the relationship between York and Leeds in this er under this criterion .
205732:71	Er so I would regard this impo this criterion as critical very er it should be given the greatest of weight and erm must be left in .
205745:139	So it 's not quite as simple to say that regional planning , sub-regional planning requires er a discount a strong discount erm to the south west of York , I think the issue is rightly addressed and we need to address it , but I must say the conversation so far , and and the contributions , really need to be weighted in one direction .
205759:12	Erm I have to concur with that but nevertheless , er the north east sector is further away from Leeds than the south west sector of York .
205760:7	One has to go through past or around York erm for your shopping facilities .
205787:15	I think we have to go back to what is the fundamental purpose of the York new settlement and that is to meet some of the development plan requirements of the Greater York area .
205806:18	But the actually new settlement would have to be located outside the Greater York area , as you are now defining it .
205815:64	Coming back to what is er er greater what is greater York , you would need to have to assess to look at the socioeconomic linkages with with er with York .
205843:12	Well you 'll have to wait and see what the inspector says on the greenbelt .
205934:46	Because I think erm it it does somewhat alter the discussions that we 've had to date i clarification of that .
205961:34	You will in producing those figures chairman , ten miles have to approximate the ten miles
205986:20	I think erm one would have to ac er accept that in Greater York , erm the existing pattern of trunk roads as they affect Greater York , do discharge an important function in distributing people around er Greater York and it 's entirely sensible in the Greater York dimension that they would do .
205990:56	I agree with the panel that the criterion should give greater emphasis to public transport , that must be in accord with P P G three and must be in accord with the emerging P P G thirteen .
205990:88	I agree with the panel that the criterion should give greater emphasis to public transport , that must be in accord with P P G three and must be in accord with the emerging P P G thirteen .
206004:22	Erm in my view , it has to link in somewhere into the primary i into the road network and it 's not appropriate to link it into er the local road system and er therefore I think it 's inevitable that a linkage will need to be made to the primary road network .
206063:16	And I think that must be the key .
206071:49	I think that in the light of the emerging government guidance , that the transport choice must be given a very s substantial weight in the in that decision mak making process .
206132:61	Because by definition it is not related to an existing settlement , it is not in the greenbelt , it must be in the countryside .
206139:92	Erm I just do n't I I I simply want to make the point that the protection of the countryside for its own sake is planning policy which must be brought within the of that criterion .
206165:9	And that must be what should be expressed in the criterion .
206283:89	Er my main my main concern i i is really related to the implication within it that that literally every cost which is associated with a new settlement would have to be borne by the developer .
206304:26	Erm er presumably this is something would have to be elaborated in the explanatory memorandum .
206361:21	Yes I I presume there must be some form of safeguarding areas laid down by British Coal .
206375:32	Nevertheless it is a very clear strategic matter which must be included in my view in the in the criteria included in the structure plan .
206423:69	Therefore in considering the degree to which any er area can assimilate a new settlement , the size which it must reach subsequent to two thousand and six , should be considered in addition to the size it expected to reach by that date .
206425:80	I 'm not sure sure how we could build it into the criteria of But it 's it 's a point which would obviously have to be borne in mind in terms of the str you know , the planning process .
206468:10	We 'll have to conclude at one because the we have another issue in the afternoon .
206471:81	I would hope that we might be able to arrange it but obviously if it is er out of the question , then we 'd have to try to rearrange it some other time .
206482:89	the participants for H Two will have already discovered , we are still tackling part of H One from yesterday , but , and I apologize that you will have to sit through the outstanding items of discussion .
206623:125	Erm , the first point relates to erm affordable housing targets in York , and the consequences that that has in relation not only to York but other areas , on the on the assumption that that there is , there has to be an overspill to to adjou adjacent areas .
206671:24	But I , we 're going to have to discuss when we get to H Two just how you 're going through the process of actually finding a site .
206737:138	The overlap with the districts needs to be eradicated , it 's a black hole at the moment , every district can pass a its surplus on to another district , and indeed it would be the last district to prepare a district wide local plan that has to meet the residue of the Greater York requirement , it may maybe a good stimulus for the districts to get on with their local plans , but that 's not an planning way .
206738:199	What we would advocate , as indeed Mr Smith did earlier , is that there should be a a global figure for Greater York , and a reduction , in an appropriate reduction in the requirement for each district , and I believe that anticipating you might ask me what that is what that reduction should be , erm I I can say it must be related to the ca capacity , of that district within Greater York .
206879:107	The development strategy adopted in the Greater York study never envisaged that the settlement , or the district that got the new settlement would therefore get a corresponding reduction in the amount of land it had to provide to meet the needs of the Greater York area , the strategy we use to identify sites within the Greater York area that could be developed without compromising greenbelt objectives , and that the new settlement would be added on outside that area without a reduction in that that figure .
206988:79	In that interim period of that work the draft P P G three came out , and made it quite clear that the new settlement would have to lie without beyond the outer edge of the greenbelt , and that was a fur a further consideration .
207023:28	The third thing , and I gu would have to say it 's a bit of a red herring thrown out by Mr Curtis is the issue of traffic growth con concern on traffic growth .
207084:153	Now I am able to say that Barton Willmore has done this work , and it has submitted as part of our submission to the E I P , and in summary what I would say is that I believe that that work demonstrates that the new settlement has to be in the order of two thousand to two thousand five hundred dwellings , to begin to achieve the environmental objectives set for the new settlement , and also social objectives which would also be important to the residents of that new settlement .
207119:29	I put it to you that this proposal has to be considered , any new settlement proposal has to be considered within the light of a post two thousand and six strategy , in that light this new settlement proposal will not , at around fourteen hundred , satisfy the situation .
207119:52	I put it to you that this proposal has to be considered , any new settlement proposal has to be considered within the light of a post two thousand and six strategy , in that light this new settlement proposal will not , at around fourteen hundred , satisfy the situation .
207122:249	It is a so it 's a complex set of interrelationships we 're looking at er on a sub-regional basis , I do believe that there is capacity , some capacity around the inner area of York , and to what extent the greenbelt enquiry er inspector will retain what I and others and certainly York City Council would believe is sufficient capacity remains to be seen , and though similar pleas were made at that enquiry I think they have to be restated here .
207132:110	Given the lack of a capacity within the city and in the settlements surrounding to absorb significant elements of major development it seems to me that it is inevitable that green fields er will have to be taken to satisfy the future development needs .
207139:44	I think those pressures will still be there and that another solution will have to be found , albeit in the middle term to reduce the further demands , continuing demands for peripheral expansion of the city .
207161:19	That 's all I have to say .
207190:135	And I think that the alternative of the new settlement is by far the best solution , provided it is mixed with some peripheral development , one ca n't go into a position where there is all peripheral development or all new settlement , it has to be in perfect balance , because some needs cannot of course be met by the new settlement .
207249:27	We heard what Mr er Davis had to say this morning , and at at one point was very very important , we are expecting to be in possession of reports on the greenbelt local enquiry and your report er round about the same time , and indeed since they they are in control of proceedings thereafter they are in a position to make sure that they do n't have to reach decisions on one until they are in possession of the other .
207249:214	We heard what Mr er Davis had to say this morning , and at at one point was very very important , we are expecting to be in possession of reports on the greenbelt local enquiry and your report er round about the same time , and indeed since they they are in control of proceedings thereafter they are in a position to make sure that they do n't have to reach decisions on one until they are in possession of the other .
207257:138	It 's obviously too early for me to judge whether in the absence of such a definition the Department seek to intervene , but in the word , in the light of what is said in the current P P G I think that must be a possibility , but for the moment , sir , we have very much have an open mind , and we obviously , like everyone else , are looking forward to your conclusions on this issue .
207361:10	It also must be remembered er that the transport links to Easingwold would not be good enough to support that level of development , it does not have a rail station and it does it , and the A nineteen is only a single carriageway road , and would need ld need isagree with Mr Jewitt upon re 1
207362:34	Now , would n't necessarily suggesting that the existing settlement would have to sustain all of the addition given only what it 's got at the moment .
207419:161	Just er for clarification that that is indeed the case as Mr Cunnane says , but the erm the village envelopes were brought forward by way of an alteration to the adopted rural areas local plan which will take us up to nineteen ninety six , erm we will possibly have to look and review some of those envelopes in connection with the emerging local plan .
207422:12	You do n't have to go over the arguments , I 've heard that .
207444:171	Erm now I I do n't think anybody 's suggesting that in er the Greater York new settlement we would be likely to achieve a large shopping mall anchored at both ends , one by Marks and Spencers er and the other by Fenwicks , or or or any o or bins or any other department store , so he must really understand the process and really what we talking about er er in North Yorkshire .
207558:7	I had to be stud groom .
207573:7	I must say yo yo you never , unless you 've got a good second man er especially foaling time yo my son-in-law do n't leave the place .
207594:40	That 's all I had , that 's all I had to pay my men .
207658:14	Most studs , you had to lead your foal and lead your mare .
207662:14	Lady James , you had to come over a water bridge at er , her stud .
207669:34	Look at the , look at the miles you had to walk at !
207725:17	And er , I never had to leave them .
207728:9	And you had to stay with them all the while ?
207730:32	. Whe when you went and you did n't have to leave them , you know .
207731:64	You was insured not to leave yo wha you I was in charge of them horses , you must n't leave them .
207733:27	They was in box so I 've had to go and get my tea and my grub .
207740:7	You have to do it inside the box .
207742:7	You had to stay with them
207911:30	Well the plane arrived at Gatwick and he 's had to take these mares back from Gatwick cos the plane that was taking them had broken down .
208009:18	What about , did you have to take your own feed along for them ?
208014:16	But some , some you had to give the needle to before you set off .
208018:9	So you had to have it , they when to sle they were worse when they were coming out of it .
208025:78	He got out of the planes coming , we , we was coming over from de Laborgie and you give him the needle and I had to lead him off the lead him off the plane , and going down over the chimneys in Chantilly to landu Laborgie he goes , woo ooh ooh , getting ready you know .
208087:30	But if horse went on his own you 'd have to put it on .
208089:15	Yo a you 'd have to put th their head collar and rope on it .
208112:132	He went up there this year , I was up , this is true on God 's , I 'm in this chair he said , come on I 'll I 'm going now I 'm gonna get my , I had to go I had to go and get Rififi , a filly called Rififi I did .
208112:147	He went up there this year , I was up , this is true on God 's , I 'm in this chair he said , come on I 'll I 'm going now I 'm gonna get my , I had to go I had to go and get Rififi , a filly called Rififi I did .
208191:29	Well you see that 's what they had to do .
208318:9	You must n't condemn them , you must n't do anything , you must just sit quiet and say nothing .
208318:25	You must n't condemn them , you must n't do anything , you must just sit quiet and say nothing .
208318:41	You must n't condemn them , you must n't do anything , you must just sit quiet and say nothing .
208338:37	Well the head lad was a , er the head lad had to see the head lad 's er , job was to be there first in the morning and the last off the place at night .
208345:48	He went back , some horses left a bit in their manger I used to have to put all that down nothing verbal , all on paper .
208361:32	That fella up at Cecil 's , I should he must be getting a fortune .
208370:7	You had to do it yourself .
208468:13	But the old animals must have it see like th for fitness .
208487:12	They also , must have the time , must have the exercise .
208487:26	They also , must have the time , must have the exercise .
208498:10	And they have to show their horses all the way , the governor walks all the way round the lot of them .
208525:29	If it 's a veterinary job , well I have to send for the vet .
208544:9	The owners have to re know all this you know .
208559:7	I have to do all that .
208712:27	Thirty and forty horses I used to have to ball then .
208734:9	So you have to split them up between you .
208750:8	We have to do them , we have to help one another .
208750:26	We have to do them , we have to help one another .
208758:18	That 's how they have to do it .
208772:42	They 'll say ah , if you have stable off , we had to give it to them you see .
208793:21	And they , do they all have to carry the same weight ?
208854:13	See , you have to know all your men 's weight .
208911:7	We had to put up with the traffic .
208925:17	You know , you had to put up with all that , you had to take your chances in them days .
208925:43	You know , you had to put up with all that , you had to take your chances in them days .
208933:36	Been a few year they 've been , been about , must have been er erm twenty or thirty year now .
208941:42	Oh yes , it 's council do n't do it , er , they have to , the Trainers ' Association paid for that .
208976:149	Now , if that were right , that is , here 's our bodily bit here , that 's what individuates them , right , Socrates is shorter than Plato , Plato is a bit taller than Socrates , Socrates has funny bulgy eyes , erm Plato must have been rather a normal looking person , a variety of things that differentiate them , but they 're not different in respect of being human beings .
209000:116	So , if that is the case how can we possibly lose our identity because we have n't , we 're not , there 's no suggestion if we go on an inward journey , the inward journey must be within our selves , within our individuality , not , not jumping out into some form of spacial context .
209001:145	Well , except that , that erm I think that even in defending our idea that we retain our individuality you relied on spacial movement , that is when you say that , or when I say that the one is within us , clearly you must be speaking metaphorically .
209028:108	In order that is for there to be some change , whether er change er like having a page torn out or a change like moving from one location to another , there also has to be something that stays the same , mainly the subject of change .
209208:103	But then when you do peel them away , whether you can have a potentiality , like the when talked about he talked about either side of his face timeless void that you had to see the limit of it so that you could have erm that that I was in this body and there 's something about this body that I 'm going to go back into the body and then that could differentiate perhaps .
209217:64	And your point , which I think is very important , is erm maybe this is an analysis that has to be given erm by a multiplicity of necessary conditions , none of which is singularly sufficient , but all of which are jointly necessary and sufficial .
209253:56	When I try to give up who I am erm none of who I am has to do with this external er additional tool .
209291:16	Right , we 'd have to take a look at that cos I suspect that if he says each is coloured by the host
209531:85	Erm , some of you are very critical of , of , of the Penguin operation when you were in the U S A but I have to tell you , they did achieve record sales there last year and increased market share and in fact the children 's er , book publishing was twenty percent ahead of the year before .
209561:7	We had to do it cos I 'm a member of the task force .
209630:96	One is that we do make acquisitions , we on , on the whole er , prefer er , organic growth because it is normally more profitable and the prices you have to pay for acquisitions er , tend to put significant premiums on the companies you buy which you may er , in the longer run eventually erm , er , turn into shareholder value .
209631:17	But er , any acquisition has to fit extremely well strategically and it has to be at a price that we consider to be a , a , a good price .
209631:41	But er , any acquisition has to fit extremely well strategically and it has to be at a price that we consider to be a , a , a good price .
209674:38	Last autumn it was stated in a document that there would have to be further subscriptions of finance before er , the project became profitable .
209695:20	The point I think that has to be understood about EuroDisney , which perhaps has n't been properly perceived yet by the public is that it is very much a destination for the British public .
209709:32	Alton Towers clearly is an exception but again , you have to pay a lot of money for it and it takes quite some time to get the return er , back and , and I would say that erm , many of Michael 's erm , er , organic erm , er , expenditure will , will erm , provide er , a really good return rather quicker but in the long run we think Alton is good .
209721:193	Well , we 've got our cost reductions as an ongoing process er , so it 's never complete , you 're always looking for ways to , to become more efficient or effective but I do n't anticipate any redundancies er , any further redundancies but obviously if , if , if systems become available which improve our efficiency and effectiveness we , we have to take account of it .
209726:7	It must be quite possible , which might mean that there will be some more shares er , available there but er , that is complete speculation .
209735:63	But we then took a view about , about future years because in a sense we 've always been , obviously had to provide for the er , year impression .
209860:50	But obviously in a recessionary period , which we are certainly not out of yet , you have to remember that Alton Towers has a per cap of something like fourteen pounds a head at the moment , er , average of all people .
209880:29	Last year , you 'll remember , we had to absorb , in fact in the Tussauds group , about three quarters of a million er , pounds on the increase in V A T and that was a blow to us at the beginning of the season , you remember it was the budget more or less this time last year .
209949:136	Longman did particularly well in the U K , although coeternal markets were difficult and er , sales in the schools markets in er , North America was hard going for Addison Wesley , with U S physical problems restricting the , amou money that schools had to er , had to use .
209949:149	Longman did particularly well in the U K , although coeternal markets were difficult and er , sales in the schools markets in er , North America was hard going for Addison Wesley , with U S physical problems restricting the , amou money that schools had to er , had to use .
210176:89	Yeah , one of the reasons it bucked the trend was because we 've erm , ground one of our competitors into the dust and he 's had to combine with another newspaper there and that too is struggling .
210320:28	Or will it be another one that I have to join in with ?
210399:60	I therefore worked on the premise that if , if a fifth of our work comes from then it must be right to have approximately a fifth of our staff based in
210413:34	Erm , there is one slight technical problem which I have to overcome in relation to a computer terminal but I 'll erm face that problem at if and when that situation develops .
210425:146	At the annual meeting , the annual meeting last year in the institute , it was obvious to me that one of the major concerns of people in this town was policing and police presence and I think the joint effort that we 've put forward , and I must mention as well since he 's , we 've worked very well together , the police liaison office has been running extremely well I feel , the number of calls have gone up since we started .
210482:18	What a sad thing to have to say .
210498:41	The development of this site in nineteen ninety three is unacceptable and must be not be approved .
210499:30	We who live in know best and must be heard .
210538:207	I think the things that have come out of this for me er from Councillor actually is that it would be unlikely that we , we or would be allocating that plan today and I think the amount of traffic has increased through the town centre would make it foolish and one does wonder at the wisdom if all the development went along which had to be serviced then through er Street and through the town centre in to the main areas of employment that happened years ago .
210544:90	I think we should express our concern in the way that it 's being handled and I think there are grounds for concern and I think must be aware that this Council is watching what they 're doing .
210574:7	I have to say to you I 'd no idea I was doing this this evening so I 'm gonna do everything and backup .
210649:10	You might have to leave the room again .
210718:63	Yes well I think to answer bo both of yo your concerns , first of all we have to accept that the Planning Committee has , actually has power to make its decisions not to come back to this Council so I 'm afraid it is a decision of the Planning Committee .
210750:10	You 'll have to tell me if I cover anything that you 've already done .
210821:81	Now , they call evidence under a section nine , you , you can agree a section nine statement , prosecution statement , but you do n't have to , right ?
210869:15	But why does it have to be that ?
210910:12	You no longer have to bring it within an exception .
210916:30	When you are dealing with statements , you must start off and go through it step by step and not leap ahead .
210947:66	So , for instance , if you have an argument with the police er on a matter , you might very well have to say to the police , I think officer you were take that and say you 're a lying bastard .
211005:42	Sure , this is where I , this is where erm I must say that I never quite understood this , but if the prosecution witnesses , in their statements or in their oral evidence , refer to your client 's bad character , then that is inadmissible , completely inadmissible .
211070:67	Here it may be that er it 's important to say er what she said value or what relevance it has to the trial of the son anyway .
211109:16	So , what you have to argue is that that is not a confession .
211155:10	They 'd have to warn themselves .
211421:116	We will have a skip on site , so that any rubbish that accidentally sneaks through , can be put in there , and that 's something we 've budgeted for , the fact that we will have to remove rubbish .
211468:25	Right , hopefully , I think we must take this as erm , part B agenda item at the main council meeting .
211493:7	I must say , I 've been pleasantly sur you know ve pleased , by the number applications from youth activities that have come through .
211551:96	I mean , I have n't done a detailed survey on anything , but I was pleasantly surprised by what I saw when I went in there , and I must say , I went there expecting it to be no more than a garden hut .
211577:74	I mean , if you , if you into , if you were trying to look into building or commercial and you had to send them a planning application for it , you 'd have to prove that building could support the weight .
211577:110	I mean , if you , if you into , if you were trying to look into building or commercial and you had to send them a planning application for it , you 'd have to prove that building could support the weight .
211610:7	We have to draw the line at some point .
211687:15	Well , you 'll have to think how much
211692:35	Well I , well I , I mean I 've had to do my homework , before I come on this meeting for you , and I , and if I can start at the back and work forwards we have got enough money .
211782:7	They have to do
211827:15	the amount we have to pay for the pitch is no fault of the Centre , it 's the fact that East Devon and Devon County permitted competitive pitches to be opened up quite close ,
211846:20	I , I think you have to be sure
211872:12	We 're gonna have to look for more , you know , it 's December now ,
211952:7	It must be , must n't it ?
211952:15	It must be , must n't it ?
211986:13	Well , this has got to come in a letter , I mean , this is what we want .
212011:18	I think we 'll have to support that .
212022:103	Yeah , I attended , I used to run an A T C squad , well I used to run the two different ones in London , and A T C squadrons , and I must say I 've been invited to the last two open nights .
212046:7	But must but I do n't know how much further I want to go along that sort of line .
212047:39	Erm , but I think , I mean , do n't we have to be a bit careful about supporting other organizations in other towns ?
212060:160	Well , equally you could n't have an A T C Squadron in every small town or village in the country , and therefore they 've got to be , I mean , just as much as Otter Valley Boxing Club has extended its range to get more people , so the A T C have to be in some particular place .
212166:25	this year is it being these people must be given to understand ,
212178:12	and you would have to say , that the benefit 's gonna be far more , far reaching than it was before .
212317:115	And they 're giving quite a lot back , and I , I know you only give it as a , as a guide , Mr Chairman , but two hundred and fifty pound , I would think that would have to be doubled .
212395:24	Must n't give in to vandals , must we ?
212439:32	I think it may mean that we 'll have to call a meeting quite quickly after this one , to discuss , but I really do n't think we 've got the basis of anything till that comes back .
212445:49	If they say we 've got to pay it , well then I 'll have to come back at the council meeting .
212460:21	So I think we may have to take this as part of the council meeting when we get a report back , cos obviously , there 's a degree of urgency in whatever we do about this , but I can suggest that we can do no more than report back to the next council meeting that we 've discussed this , and that it is in solicitor 's hands .
212489:7	I must s
212495:21	And that 's something we must do before the next meeting so that I can answer the questions , cos we do n't really know at this moment .
212598:18	I think they just had to admit that it 's not , they ca n't , they ca n't do any s s sin , because it 'd say so , right .
212612:7	I must object .
212766:7	I must confess when I first saw the plan , I was totally confused by it .
212787:7	I have to say there 's a little bit grieving in the way
212838:23	I would feel you do n't have to put a particular interest on
212876:19	So for all those reasons I have to refuse .
212879:15	With that , you must have thirty four parking spaces .
212898:119	The fact that we 've got partnership holders and sanctuary housing association , would seem to me that we 're quite likely to get relocation and we 've had all round the town at the moment , and you would have to agree that here is a very strong reason for , for the medical centre to be worried about the effect on the medical centre .
212935:82	Well , of course , we ca n't consider that this time , because it 's outline so , so we ca n't , you know , you must con
212937:7	We have to go to
212951:34	You know , you gotta forget that you , you must remember them , that , that it 's been passed by the minister .
212972:13	Well , I must ad I 'm a bit confused by all this , erm , and I do n't mean
212998:11	So , it must be the effect , not only on the adjoining properties , but also on Riley House itself , and the inadequate amount of curbage left with Riley House .
213123:24	That 's okay , we do n't have to advertise
213158:12	Well , they have to put up the
213280:7	You must get back to this every time .
213295:7	It has to be walled
213298:12	Well , I must
213342:19	I think I 'm gonna have to give my apologies for tomorrow night .
213454:92	Erm , because the governments are trying to protect domestic industries through and erm , they are trying to do this by actually physically blocking imports so domestic consumers have to , have to buy from domestic producers rather than from abroad to stop the domestic industry declining .
213454:101	Erm , because the governments are trying to protect domestic industries through and erm , they are trying to do this by actually physically blocking imports so domestic consumers have to , have to buy from domestic producers rather than from abroad to stop the domestic industry declining .
213470:44	Alright , and because that , protectionism is required to do that , we must be taking resources away from more efficient industries and putting them into , into agriculture .
213574:28	Because er , to produce more output you have to have a bigger stock , and therefore the price goes up , so you produce more , decreasing not quite so much , and keep a greater percentage than you did last year , so that for cows , as the price goes up you 've got to counteract it again , cows this year , and try to sort of , keep my , get my herd bigger and bigger , and profitable .
213576:43	Right , if we want to increase the long run output we may have to reduce short run output .
213578:220	If you think of it the other way when , what happens when a price , when a price falls , alright , if farmers er , assume that price fall will be sustained over a number of periods , then they think , right well in order to achieve the same level of income , right , as I did previously , if prices have fallen , I 'm going to have to increase my output .
213627:58	Essentially because there is a erm , a production lag , or a growing season that we , farmers will have to base their production decisions alright , on previous prices .
213830:93	Production tends to be focused on very large plants , erm , and each plant will produce erm , a particular good for the whole world market and so therefore trade must , must increase .
213830:99	Production tends to be focused on very large plants , erm , and each plant will produce erm , a particular good for the whole world market and so therefore trade must , must increase .
213880:12	Well , that must reduce trade as well , cos if , if prices are high in the domestic market , they 're not going to want to sell them in another market are they ?
213905:10	I 've had to lecture for Paul
213982:7	We have to keep the track all turned on .
213996:30	So we can reduce the prices that we have to pay for everything .
213997:29	You know , beef and things that we have to import from the E C at the moment , we could import from like , New Zealand .
214013:109	Mm say if you 're on the world , if you , if you 're a net importer , right , erm , and you 're buying your food commodities from the world market , you must have been rubbing your hands over the last fifty years cos you 're getting , you 're buying , you 're buying a food commodities will lower , lower prices than you would have done in the presence of free trade , cos there 's all this dumping and European surpluses , you know Come in
214072:39	Er , he may , he may be , you 'll have to , to ask him , but generally speaking he does have er
214114:79	Well , erm , there is a cost involved in moving from , physically moving from one to the other , and also when you have to weigh up er , costs of moving your family or the risks involved and things like that , so that 's all involved in that .
214171:120	You know , you may , you may be the best , and therefore think , think you have a , or have a high opinion of yourself , and therefore try your luck , you know , if somebody must be getting those jobs it could be me .
214218:66	That 's right , I mean , in order to eq equalize wages between sector , labour and also capital has to be perfectly mobile .
214286:20	But what , what you must have , right , is a definition of erm , the er , sort of thing that you 're asked to write about .
214287:92	I mean , factor price equalization , intra-industry measuring intra-industry trade , optimal intervention , reciprocal dumping , they 're all jargon , bits of jargon effect effectively , so you must , you must have a definition .
214287:100	I mean , factor price equalization , intra-industry measuring intra-industry trade , optimal intervention , reciprocal dumping , they 're all jargon , bits of jargon effect effectively , so you must , you must have a definition .
214290:15	Right , so you must put a definition , a definition in there .
214291:31	An example of it in use , and you must have ex what I 'm saying , it 's very important to have empirical erm , examples in your essays , right , because they will also be required in the short answer questions as well .
214295:63	Alright , if it 's a , so you , you 've got to have a definition , alright , you must have a , an example of it in , in action .
214298:10	But you must have , you know , do n't ramble on about the same thing , right , cos , for , for , for any more than a couple of sentences , cos then , you know , you c start entering into sort of diminishing marginal returns very , very quickly on these short answer questions , what you want to , do is sort of say a sentence about as much as you can rather than go into in depth discussion about erm , any particular aspect .
214306:61	If they give you a diagram like that , can you just talk about the lines , you do n't have to say what they are ?
214347:15	The first thing we must er be sure of is that the coefficients within the sample are reasonably , er reasonably constant , right .
214436:19	See what he s has to say .
214523:127	What other reasons might account for this urban rural wage differential , just generally higher er standard of living er just cost , just prices er yeah , the cost the cost of living may well be higher and as a result employers have to pay higher wages ,
214574:13	All this potential migrant has to do is to say well does that area right exceed sorry this area .
214643:7	We must have in a short answer like there 's a definition , most of the concepts there will be erm defined effective protection , its optimal , optimal tariff , trained creation , or trained diversion , there will be concepts that need definition , economic jargon , so you must have an equal er definition in there and you must have examples of how this concept is used , right say erm er one of those about do n't make reciprocal dumping .
214643:153	We must have in a short answer like there 's a definition , most of the concepts there will be erm defined effective protection , its optimal , optimal tariff , trained creation , or trained diversion , there will be concepts that need definition , economic jargon , so you must have an equal er definition in there and you must have examples of how this concept is used , right say erm er one of those about do n't make reciprocal dumping .
214643:182	We must have in a short answer like there 's a definition , most of the concepts there will be erm defined effective protection , its optimal , optimal tariff , trained creation , or trained diversion , there will be concepts that need definition , economic jargon , so you must have an equal er definition in there and you must have examples of how this concept is used , right say erm er one of those about do n't make reciprocal dumping .
214645:77	Er or are there is there , are there a couple of schools of thought on this particular subject , well essentially what you must do is write something about everything you know , about erm that this particular sort of concept , do n't write everything you know on this particular subject , like you have only got fifteen minutes .
214649:18	That 's what you must do , if you get , if you write a lot about a couple of things they 'll say erm this chap 's knowledge is pretty specialized on this area , you know what , what these er short answer questions are picking up right is your , is your general knowledge .
214650:9	So it has to be sort of like written in comprehensive ?
214711:93	Always use the F statistics unless there are circumstances in which you ca n't , right if the computer does n't generate an F statistic , then you will just have to use the L M version .
214743:77	Larger dis large test statistics mean rejection of the goal right erm there 's no simple rule of thumb with kie squared you just have to look at the erm actual tables to find out what the critical values are .
214752:9	Do you have to say an N two would you round up or round down to be sure ?
214757:7	You must give the exact critical values , right , if those critical values that you are using to compare with the regressionally significant whether you have serial correlation or not erm so they 're very very important and they ought to be included erm because otherwise we do n't know whether a test statistic is er statistically significant or not .
214763:164	Right , Microfit holds this in this regard and every regression that you estimate will always have a table of diagnostic test statistics after it , right , so although we are interested in the parameter values of our estira estimated right , in order to have any confidence in those parameter values you must ensure that we have n't violated any of the assumptions
214822:34	I do n't know about you , but if I had to sort of pass something on to somebody else to check , if I can see somebody scribbling on it , I , I , I , I feel quite edgy , I hate it , I like to feel that I can do it and I can do it well and that other people do n't need to have to amend it .
214822:218	I do n't know about you , but if I had to sort of pass something on to somebody else to check , if I can see somebody scribbling on it , I , I , I , I feel quite edgy , I hate it , I like to feel that I can do it and I can do it well and that other people do n't need to have to amend it .
214833:52	Otherwise if we do n't invest money and time in training , we 're forced to have to go outside to sort of buy in people , because we have n't actually invested in them .
214859:38	Now you may as a manager think well you do n't have to do it all yourself , you can use senior people within your section who have the knowledge or you can use training officers or you can use people like ourselves at the training centre or the C B T or the I Vs or it could be that you bring the marketing department to help you out .
214865:13	Because the mistakes have to be rectified and it puts us under even more pressure because you 've got even less time .
214867:39	But as you said if it is your responsibility you 'll have to do it all yourself , there are lots of resources and lots of other people who can actually help you out who have the knowledge and you can use because you can use it as a development tool ca n't you for some of your members of the section to to give them some training expertise .
214869:7	We have to rectify more mistakes and put more pressure on us .
215090:35	So how does that now by just analyzing if you had to train a receptionist which would you concentrate on ?
215103:10	The rest had to be done , but they 're called enabling tasks .
215198:235	I joining the company something like that and if they did when you do join a department that does it you have a great sense of belonging , because some of the things you 'll do for the training will be allocated to other members round a team , yeah , all this sort of stuff and it becomes very easy , takes a monkey off your back as it were , you do n't have to worry .
215215:13	You have , have to check that through to your manager .
215219:7	You have to shout Margaret , cos I know you 've got a problem with .
215238:45	Only her , which means that when she 's not there who must do the job ?
215368:7	We have to accept that in life do n't we ?
215369:47	We ourselves are the same it might one subject area , we might have to get down to take on loads of different things .
215381:18	Individual exercise , does n't have to be I 'm sorry I 'm really how do you feel left out ?
215437:84	Well yeah , er if I 'm training you , so prepared it , but , what am I , what have I , what I have to do as a trainer make sure saying ?
215448:18	So you 're gonna have to do a little bit of work , just a tiny bit tonight on one area which is your training objective for your session tomorrow .
215504:28	Difficult you might have certain standards they must achieve , now for example er answer the telephones in three rings , answer your name and your department is that measurable ?
215543:12	They do n't have to do it .
215554:52	Cos you could turn round to me and say oh we did n't know we had to do it and you could use that as what ?
215629:23	which is another thing you have to look out for in training if you 're asking .
215720:35	Most people think that they 're being stupid if they have to ask a question they think that everyone else is n't probably thinking the same thing .
215805:7	You have to focus
215892:10	Yeah it must be , yeah .
215964:48	I 'll give you examples perhaps of none , none of these I must admit I , I do n't , I do n't think , they 're not my style I much more my page my training tend to have just two or three points on it rubber stamps on the side flipchart all this sort of stuff big question .
216031:16	A nightmare and we had to actually ring the emergency number and in an emergency ring this number
216095:29	The things like a case study where you have to gather lots of information and analyze it , I mean that 's just what the reflectors like , cos they want to feel that there 's you know they th working is not just it 's actually working on some fact .
216117:157	I 'm actually , I 'm quite high on as theorist as well and I like to write everything out in full and I clear structures and if I go to training sessions and they 're all over the place , it 's such a in about five minutes and I have to say hang on a minute it might not be structured in the way that you like it but you can actually learn from it .
216165:90	Right , so that 's all we want to look at with regards learning styles I think the key thing to remember is that we must n't fall into the trap , because it 's our learning style if we actually put together our training which reflects our style .
216196:118	Right , yes it 's quite often aggressive people passive people who like maybe having passive people around and just needs somebody to walk over to shout at and behaving in an aggressive way , so maybe we have to go aggressive when we deal with an aggressive person .
216250:30	Okay now at this stage you do n't normally have to ask for volunteers for the first group because it usually sort of role then off they go .
216276:18	Certainly a word you must , you will , I imposing language .
216301:120	All at the end you do is losing your voice and , and if you do n't get your way , then you it up louder and louder and louder and if you do n't get your way you may have to back down then and the aggressive person backing down to sort of a submissive does n't always hold very much credibility .
216339:49	What are some of the things that you can do when you actually have to deal with these people , particularly remember if you try to achieve influence on a course here , that 's what we 're here for .
216420:23	we 've come , we 've had to make at previous meetings , Chairman , about the er , about the fall off we 've had in demand for the small units there now .
216429:101	I think , Chairman , that 's still subject to approval by the E A B , erm , which is at the end of the day , the important party that has to be satisfied , so , these are very successful negotiations , but we , we 're still awaiting erm , confirmation they 've been accepted .
216510:31	I mean , it is n't as though we have to operate a policy in which we heavily advertise the availability of grants , it , it can develop via word of mouth , if we advertise anything , we would be inundated with demand for to a level that we could n't cope with .
216518:18	I think what we have got to bear in mind , Mr Chairman , is that the small business is , it is a very , very dangerous time as we come out of recession , more businesses get into difficulties when they 're into expanding , than when they 're just , just surviving , if you like so erm , I think we have to keep a very careful eye on the next six months .
216518:206	I think what we have got to bear in mind , Mr Chairman , is that the small business is , it is a very , very dangerous time as we come out of recession , more businesses get into difficulties when they 're into expanding , than when they 're just , just surviving , if you like so erm , I think we have to keep a very careful eye on the next six months .
216521:60	I think , I take your point Ivor , and we do n't dissent from it , what we have to guard against , two things , one , that the Committee becomes big and cumbersome , and two , of course , we must n't get into a situation where a regional representative is repre is influencing decisions made elsewhere in the county , that 's the effect of the
216521:134	I think , I take your point Ivor , and we do n't dissent from it , what we have to guard against , two things , one , that the Committee becomes big and cumbersome , and two , of course , we must n't get into a situation where a regional representative is repre is influencing decisions made elsewhere in the county , that 's the effect of the
216544:7	We had to nominate a member .
216569:40	All I would say , Jerry , is that it 'll have to come out of something like our carry forwards for this .
216611:86	Conversely , though , if this Committee instructed groups as it well could that it wanted regular updates on the pay position of this County , and he had to put someone to work on researching them , it would cost you what like that ?
216765:13	Chairman , I must just say about other organizations , it is approved that they 're going , part of the West Midlands region , is more better off than integral part of the region of Great Britain , or whatever , erm , if they 've got money into their region , they jolly well keep it there , we do n't know where Coventry is .
216777:8	I must in honesty , wonder whether the smaller , reduced unitary
216806:59	I believe that if the post office changes hands , that 's quite a crucial time because the newcomers may have to put up front quite a large sum of money .
216867:21	No , no , you do n't have to apologise to me .
216882:175	Two , two , one and , and the groups tell us who the representatives are , and I , I wo n't serve on the committee , I think I 'll er , that I 'll , you 've given me enough to do anyway , there 's a limit , and unlike our officer , I do have to do some cooking .
216937:19	I think Chair , you have to speculate to accumulate do n't you ?
217032:119	Now if you take away er , another lump of money including carry forwards , you really do reduce your own ability to be able to pay to take advantage of the window of opportunity we now have to actually put European money into the county .
217061:101	Last year was erm , an additional twenty thousand pounds at the last moment , chickenfeed for the big committees , that 's the annoying thing , but what particularly annoys me , and I have to say this , I 'll express it is the knowledge that what can be a phenomenal deprivation to this Committee , goes very , very , very little towards solving the major problems that this county faces , it does n't have a tremendous impact .
217114:26	We do n't spend it unless we have to , we seek to persuade the tenants to contribute towards it , indeed even if we contribute , we get a rent back on it .
217128:15	I mean you must see it yourself .
217129:11	Okay there must be a reason for doing this , but er I 'm more concerned with getting oil out North Sea .
217161:10	Well I have to say that as a result of last night 's session I have a much healthier view of Hydro Electric and I do so would I have got that from the programme ?
217196:137	view is that one hopes that my hopes are that of the direct report you er worked for erm is equal and competent and is erm in a sense courageous and brave and that they realize that sometimes to get the best results you have to do things which are perhaps challenging and orthodox
217226:116	If you do it through A B S A , the government will give another ten thousand pounds so of course for the orchestra or the institution whether it 's opera , ballet , concert or whatever is , but it must be arts gets the extra money so of course that in a sense is very enabling .
217234:143	and to deal with problems of substance abuse , unemployment , illiteracy , rather than things which are fashionable and to my mind highly like opera and the ballet which is n't to say that I do n't love them both , but I think that you have to have a sense of complete reality about the social issues .
217235:221	But then that question was asked last night erm from one chap about sport versus the arts and I suppose to me it is a quality of life issue erm where do you start an and stop I mean you have a problem when you have a recession do n't you , where you say okay we i we are in a recession we have got limited resources we have to make decisions .
217247:9	and it had to appeal to a broader group .
217249:49	Do you know what the total price of the tickets would have been if I had to pay for this , one hundred and ten pounds
217262:73	Do n't get me wrong , I 'm not saying that companies should n't sponsor ballet or opera , but I think they have to not lose sight of sponsorship potential with the disadvantages as well as the anonymous giving branch , because small amounts of money to some organizations may do disproportionately more than the Scottish Opera
217310:19	for Apple Macintosh Computers erm it must have been about three or four years ago .
217327:25	Before you get too political you must remember the only time I 've been actively political was for an independent candidate .
217376:100	Yeah , but you know when you I mean when you feel sick , you remember the sick and it 's C I C against C I C and you just have to remember because in fact courage , compassion and integrity can actually help you to deal or to try to deal more or less successively with any circumstance .
217407:214	It really is I mean I I still feel guilty and it might sound daft to you , but I still feel guilty and what would my have done about I was down in London a few weeks ago for a meeting and I was coming back on the sleeper and I got the train to Euston and erm I came out at the wrong spot , so I had to walk out of Euston Underground and then round to go to Euston Station rather than going through
217509:46	As you are all probably aware , Death Trap , originally planned for February , had to be scrapped despite valiant efforts by the casting committee and John the directors get around the problem of the men or rather the lack of them .
217539:238	Erm basically we 've spent more than we 've erm taken in but that was a deliberate policy agreed on by the committee we 've already mentioned Norman 's flats erm that has been a most worthwhile expenditure and we 've got to look at that as a long-term investment because we 've got flats which are going to last for years and our expenditure which was getting on for fifteen hundred pounds will not have to be repeated .
217549:12	but we obviously have to cut off at a certain time to er get the accounts and audited in time .
217550:54	So there will be a slight improvement on that position but erm I do feel that we have to continue to do them the costume plays we ca n't just say oh we do n't make a profit on it , we ca n't do it , I think that would be a very shortsighted erm philosophy .
217563:36	I , I agree that it is something that we must make sure that we arrange in future because people do get nervous about the cars out there unattended and er
217592:29	So I think erm those two gentlemen will have to leave the room , I think while is taken .
217635:31	Right , so Tim is nominated by Bert , has to be approached , I think be approached .
217678:10	You 'd have to know in advance .
217684:35	Any more comments obviously I think we 're gonna have to take er
217706:29	Erm oh , obviously we 're going to have to vote on specifics eventually .
217713:10	I would have to guess at the others because I did n't do erm sums on the other ones it was only on the last play but if it 's on the same sort of erm proportions , then I would say somewhere around thirty percent of the audience are concessions .
217714:11	I just have to multiply that , the , the figure by twenty five or divide by four pounds , it 's no small sum .
217916:56	Yes I mean it does n't go down well and I 'll say the things you have to do when you when you 're helping to run a club , you have to commit yourself to the club and you have to do the jobs that th presented by the club .
217916:105	Yes I mean it does n't go down well and I 'll say the things you have to do when you when you 're helping to run a club , you have to commit yourself to the club and you have to do the jobs that th presented by the club .
217916:133	Yes I mean it does n't go down well and I 'll say the things you have to do when you when you 're helping to run a club , you have to commit yourself to the club and you have to do the jobs that th presented by the club .
217926:22	When we got there we had to species of fish and then take it out and
217937:47	Yes of course yeah , but the , you know , we , we have to , I have to make a report and I have to recommend so I 'm recommending that we forget about the three-way stuff .
217937:59	Yes of course yeah , but the , you know , we , we have to , I have to make a report and I have to recommend so I 'm recommending that we forget about the three-way stuff .
217937:80	Yes of course yeah , but the , you know , we , we have to , I have to make a report and I have to recommend so I 'm recommending that we forget about the three-way stuff .
217938:142	Er , we had a breeders ' meeting in October which was I enjoy them very much , I enjoy the the talk because it 's the first chance I get during the year when I can sit down and listen and I do n't have to worry about them generally , in another club , I do n't have to worry about minutes or anything , I just sit and listen and it 's great it , I really enjoy that .
217938:183	Er , we had a breeders ' meeting in October which was I enjoy them very much , I enjoy the the talk because it 's the first chance I get during the year when I can sit down and listen and I do n't have to worry about them generally , in another club , I do n't have to worry about minutes or anything , I just sit and listen and it 's great it , I really enjoy that .
217939:15	Meetings once again I have to say the old , old chestnut please can we start at eight o ' clock er we 're getting new members who get a bit discouraged when we have a late start .
217946:223	So you John now Jonathan he 's only fifteen , I know he looks in his twenties , but he 's only fifteen and he 's done a lot of homework so it makes him late and it makes him uncomfortable and he 's fidgety because he knows he 's got to disturb us when he goes out , he does n't does n't enjoy disturbing us , so I have to make that clear to you .
217947:137	Erm again i er the old story , we ca n't get speakers on a Monday and better luck in last year this year , sorry er I was able to get Danny but there again he came very expensive erm but we brought , we had to bring him from Lancaster so er , you ca n't expect him to come for nothing .
217956:28	Erm and that 's about all I have to say , Mr Chairman .
217969:114	Erm because of a social evening er we had a raffle and a whiskey bowl I think the purists might not like the E in whiskey but that 's the way it 's been done that must be the southern way .
218002:23	Erm the inter-club show erm we had to pay judges er two of them thirty pound , we would normally have got Keith for nothing , I know that we had two judges so we had to pay them er we did like so that 's two fifty pounds and we bought some we had some old trophies which we were able to buy plates for to use for that event .
218002:115	Erm the inter-club show erm we had to pay judges er two of them thirty pound , we would normally have got Keith for nothing , I know that we had two judges so we had to pay them er we did like so that 's two fifty pounds and we bought some we had some old trophies which we were able to buy plates for to use for that event .
218022:120	Erm we may of course go to Bowness next year if the circumstances change and we can manage it that will course cost a fair amount of money but that remains to be seen , we 'll have to wait and see how the club progresses during the year whether we think we can do it .
218027:35	It 's coming to the stage soon when we 'll have to put it in a building society , get some interest on it .
218032:64	Maybe you could the only way we could do it is er a joint account and that would be have to be based on trust you know , a mutual trust between er y your two main people er y you would just have to trust them erm nobody , how do members feel about if you
218032:139	Maybe you could the only way we could do it is er a joint account and that would be have to be based on trust you know , a mutual trust between er y your two main people er y you would just have to trust them erm nobody , how do members feel about if you
218036:25	the reason I propose giving he has to do is come
218060:68	He , he was apparently and then on the Saturday or Sunday h h he , he started to reject so he had to go back in .
218082:22	I shall put in the report must do better !
218143:39	So it was all a hotchpotch , it was all and I had to do the the best I could for those who showed fish and that was the only way I could do it .
218156:54	We auc we auctioned the books after as you know and erm so I I 'll have to make a new list of what 's left and let you have it .
218223:7	We have got to face up to the Warner Report as well , which is to do with staffing in community homes , and again , that 's an issue which we can pick up later , as we go into detailed reports .
218226:54	The final thing I want to say to you about children 's services is , we have to , we have , having great trouble breaking into prevention .
218233:50	The second one , I just wanted to draw your attention to , was , it had to do with the home help service .
218237:41	So I think these are issues that you 're going to have to consider very firmly .
218239:18	Up till now you always had to bid er , for issues arising from changes of growth in the population , and that particularly begins to pick up the issue about the aging population in the county , so if I can welcome that .
218251:187	This is something where the local authority is the lead agency , but it does involve , increasingly involve very close joint working with other agencies , particularly in the health authority , and there were various conditions attaching the funds , which have a number of , of purposes , but one of the key ones in terms of where you must spend your money , or a proportion of it , was very much aimed at not destabilizing the existing sector .
218255:49	In the past , if somebody went to the Department of Social Security , they simply had to show that they did n't have the income to fund their place , and they then received Income Support .
218257:67	So the new element of the system is very much that we , the local authority , the social services department , do now have to assess people 's needs before we offer them any sort of care package to address those needs .
218316:87	We ca n't turn round and say , sorry we ca n't afford to assess you , there is a requirement that if somebody presents themselves , we have to assess their needs .
218318:82	Quite clearly we can only do that with the resources available to you , and if the demand exceeds the ability of those resources , they will have to wait .
218350:57	The conditions attaching to grant are that the D S S transfer , eighty five percent of it has to be spent on the independent sector , and there are monitoring mechanisms in place whereby the government is going to assure itself that has happened .
218389:28	So obviously if a cook goes , a cook has to be replaced , if a care assistant goes , a care assistant has to be replaced , as long as the population is there .
218389:68	So obviously if a cook goes , a cook has to be replaced , if a care assistant goes , a care assistant has to be replaced , as long as the population is there .
218395:70	Now , they 're of two sort , there are the administrative staff , the financial staff , in other words , that have to do the physical assessments er , financial assessments which by the way are more complicated now than they were previously , because there 's all sorts of different elements and agreements having to be reached with individuals , or charitable institutions or whatever .
218396:89	And the other are the people doing the physical assessments , for example in the hospitals , er , at Princess Royal Hospital in Telford , I think , we had to , I ca n't remember the exact figure , but we certainly had to increase our staff there , our hospital social workers to secure the throughput that 's er , being required .
218396:129	And the other are the people doing the physical assessments , for example in the hospitals , er , at Princess Royal Hospital in Telford , I think , we had to , I ca n't remember the exact figure , but we certainly had to increase our staff there , our hospital social workers to secure the throughput that 's er , being required .
218405:11	But I have to say for Shropshire , it means one I think , er , per year , and that 's not going to make a big dent .
218413:127	We need to move more into that area of work , that sort of prevention , and we need if possible to move more in partnerships with voluntary organizations , but if we do that , er , then we will have to pay them .
218429:17	Chair , I think have to make a point at this stage , although as I said earlier , we have n't got a complete picture yet .
218503:79	Erm , that on the carry forwards leaves a balance in hand of a hundred and eighty thousand not specifically earmarked , and , and I must say , it 's up to you to decide what should be specifically earmarked .
218518:30	Erm , the result er , was that we had to bring in relief staff , and other staff have had to work overtime .
218518:63	Erm , the result er , was that we had to bring in relief staff , and other staff have had to work overtime .
218519:123	Staff absences actually refer in the main , to er , unfortunate situation of a number of staff this year , who have er , been suspended , er , because of er , various matters , er , which have had to be worked through .
218536:112	In a number of cases , there is a minimum level of , of staffing that is required , and therefore it is n't a matter of managing until the person comes back , you do have to replace .
218598:155	Erm , the growth in demand for people with a known disability and again is explained briefly there , and essentially means that you 've got more clients coming in than you 've got leaving because of the greater life expectancy because more are surviving at birth , and one would have to say that they are presenting more difficult problems in a health demand .
218609:49	I 've already briefly referred to item ten , and that is we 've had to increase the numbers in registration inspection during the current year , and that demand will continue , there is no provision in the base for the ongoing costs for staff who 're appointed .
218630:58	I think everyone 's accepted that fact , er , at the end of the day , someone has got to make some very , very bad decisions .
218632:127	We 'll debate and these instructions , but there 's always this shortfall , and it 's been going on for far too long , and we still have an increasing number of responsibilities , and I just find it extremely distressing to have to sit here time and time again , to go through doing things that we really know we should n't be .
218659:12	So we do have to manage this with some care .
218671:8	I must stress that we are looking primarily , or we propose to look primarily , er , at the east of the county .
218674:64	We believe as you know , that there is an over-supply of residential accommodation , not evenly distributed , I have to say that , that it varies , for example in Shrewsbury there 's a very sizable er , independent sector , but that will vary , er , in other parts of the county .
218687:69	Are you going to , when you do your care packages say we can only award so much , we 'll have to reduce it , arbitrarily ?
218689:17	Yes , I , I must say I 'm particularly concerned about home care services .
218696:9	And I have to say to you again that the home care service is the one that is most under pressure .
218741:15	Er , and I have to say that we 're obviously concerned , as they are , that there 's money put in to their side of the community care infrastructure .
218752:129	Well , at the end of the advice , whatever conclusion members reach , I 'm very , I think certainly on those areas erm , that they wish formal consultation or discussion erm , to take place , and the timescale we have to work to .
218759:49	There is a specific statutory provision scattered about , children 's services particularly , where children have to be consulted .
218761:96	But , in some of the major ones , the children and the elderly , there are quite clearly on the statutes laid down , and case law , laid down saying you must go through a process of consultation .
218762:56	Which means , that at the end of the day , before reaching your final decision , you must hear what people are saying , and so you ca n't take a decision as it were , a final decision about a closure , and then go out to consultation .
218790:12	Erm , you must know that as well as I do , so there 's , it 's six of one and half dozen of another .
218793:24	Could , could I say , I must reply to that .
218806:56	We get money for doing that , but we ca n't spend it in our homes we have to use it in the private sector , so , at the end of the day , er , whether we like it or not , we did n't like these decisions but that 's the way we 've got to go .
218818:143	The only way of addressing that differently , if indeed the guideline is strictly applied , and you 're required to identify no more than a net increase of six hundred and forty thousand in ninety five , six , the second year of this programme , then you would have to put in additional line of further savings as yet to be identified .
218821:10	I would have to say Chair , at this stage , that item twenty eight that we put in there , in terms of registration inspection now needs to be withdrawn .
218849:9	So I have to say to you that whilst I 'm putting these forward , it 's absolutely clear that we would be having adverse comments and criticism er , from the S S I , and that you would be moving into areas that I ca n't recommend to you , but I , I put them forward as obviously illustrations .
218850:27	Chair , I , I think we have to reflect that view to the P and R Committee .
218852:14	So while we have to discharge our responsibilities and , and , and show how these targets are achievable , we also are quite right to indicate our feelings about in , in , in the manner the Director 's er , expressed .
218867:49	Oh , yes , well that 's part of the issue as well and it has to be part of the strategy
218933:65	I 'm , I 'm under pressure for two decisions , Paul is here to speak to his paper and has to be in Sandwell at two o' clock , and I 'm told that the canteen closes at one thirty .
218971:132	The proposal in the review is that you probably will need to keep your joint care teams , your JCTs , which tend of course to be professionally and officer dominated , but there are strong feelings throughout the county , and one has to remember the run up to local government , erm , the local government commission is on , strong feelings especially from the voluntary sector , but also from the district councils , that there could be renewed dynamism at the local level , in terms of local care teams .
218987:8	I must admit Chairman , I think it would be useful if the language was fractionally improved .
219008:173	And I would suggest to you , it 's because it 's complicated , and forgive me if I have n't made it more simple , but that 's one reason incidentally , why in my document , I kept commissioning , the business of doing , and making the kind of hard choices that your committee 's had to make this morning , because resources will always be limited , separate from discussing everything that people would like to do , because they do n't always run together .
219079:7	It has to be sent off to the Department of Health on the fourteenth of this month .
219083:37	The other point that raises from the agreement is that we have to agree , agree a purchasing plan with the Health Authority particularly relating to nursing home care , and that purchasing plan at the moment is still at the draft stages because as Mike referred to earlier , we have no information from the Department of Health on the percentage of the funding to be spent in the independent sector .
219125:29	They 're here all this morning , but they had to go for another meeting .
219172:110	Chairman , this , this is simply a , a matter of report to you at er , this point in time about events which occurred , which received publicity , where we had to step in because a private home pr went into receivership .
219183:7	Recognition has to be made of that , erm , of course , that involves costs , and it in involves inconvenience to receivers and , and maybe other creditors but it is essential that er , whoever organizes the receivers , and I 'm not sure who it is , whoever guides them in the way they work , takes account of this , and indicates to them that they must consider the welfare of residents .
219183:222	Recognition has to be made of that , erm , of course , that involves costs , and it in involves inconvenience to receivers and , and maybe other creditors but it is essential that er , whoever organizes the receivers , and I 'm not sure who it is , whoever guides them in the way they work , takes account of this , and indicates to them that they must consider the welfare of residents .
219214:30	Can we see after , when other peo members have to go to D T O first .
219317:165	Whilst we 're able to implement quite a considerable proportion of the er , objectives without any financial commitment , this particular er , issue does erm , provide us with a considerable test , and members need to know that in order to achieve the move from residential care to community care , we would have to have some ring-fence monies to be able , to enable that shift to , to take place , before the erm , the budget could be reduced on the residential side .
219328:56	Er , assisted places in playgroups with a wider scope , now in other words , you do n't have to be at the end of the line so to speak , you can have help on , er , a much softer criteria .
219365:122	Sorry , Charles , Chair , can we er , in noting the report , also is there some way in which we can , the Committee can convey its appreciation to the people who take on this , must be onerous responsibility er , er , and also can we congratulate the people who thought the scheme up in the first place .
219380:22	Well I do n't mean they have to join youth clubs but there is some kind of coordination .
219403:80	He is very good , Mr , and he has been a county councillor in I think Staffordshire , before the days of pindown I have to er , hasten to add , but he does know both sides of the er , street as it were .
219427:56	Can I just make a comment about one section of visiting , and that 's when you have to do , er , Brookside , Wellington and Highfield .
219434:67	Yes , okay , then maybe you can mark that up then , and it might be that we , we might have to circulate all members again to see if they assume the situation of being able to undertake these particular requests er , about the visits .
219513:97	It is as we know going to be grandly opening , it has cost more than we anticipated as Bill 's probably said , we found out we had to put the foundations on a raft , because er ,
219598:157	As I understand it Chair , what you 're saying is , that there are , at three there is a , a request for an exclusion of press photographers , but the convenience of press photography we 're saying that instead of taking immediately so that we 'd have to call them back here for the even later , we 're asking you for it to be taken at the end with the rest of exclusion
219602:63	three wild parker , presumably , so that I , I , I would assume Mr Chairman if we do have to maybe you 'll be sure that he , the with three , two agreement ?
219616:47	We ca n't , we ca n't take C before B really , we 'd have to discuss C before B , we can come back into public on C if you so desire , at the end Mr
219740:12	So farmers would have to use this against sheep scab and they 've have to use other dips or sprays against fly strike in the sum sum summer .
219740:45	So farmers would have to use this against sheep scab and they 've have to use other dips or sprays against fly strike in the sum sum summer .
219753:43	But the obvious advantage of having an injection , is you do n't have to put the sheep in a bath , but the disadvantage is you 've got the residues which last us slightly longer .
219761:10	You 'd have to have cons you have to , as well as having the dipping controls , you 'd have to have the controls over marketing as well .
219761:29	You 'd have to have cons you have to , as well as having the dipping controls , you 'd have to have the controls over marketing as well .
219761:64	You 'd have to have cons you have to , as well as having the dipping controls , you 'd have to have the controls over marketing as well .
219771:12	If anything Shropshire must have more sheep than almost any other county .
219851:9	And I have to say that we 're talking about a limited number of people , that even if you deter half a dozen young fire setters in a year , you 'd probably made a fairly substantial impact in Shropshire .
219854:29	Yes , I think the answer to that has to be certainly it does .
219901:7	I must apologize for this one , it 's hard for me sometimes to understand it as well .
219924:32	It was very , very difficult for them , they had to come and they had to find the , the actual crash , and it was an appalling position to get to , erm , the efficiency was splendid .
219924:48	It was very , very difficult for them , they had to come and they had to find the , the actual crash , and it was an appalling position to get to , erm , the efficiency was splendid .
219929:183	Erm , and I , I think it 's quite beyond belief that these sort of accidents as well as the major road accidents are n't taken into consideration for our S S A , and particularly in a county like Shropshire , where there 's very little but grain in a lot of places , and that erm , money has to be found But , I would , I would really like to hear what the Officer
219987:241	I mean I think that it 's erm a good idea for members to see what firemen and I 'm thinking in particular really of fire fight fighters I should n't say firemen , fire fighters , we 've got ladies , erm , who are retained and can be at their du place of work one minute , and twenty minutes afterwards they 've got to face up to ho horrendous sights , erm , it must have a tr traumatic effect on them .
220073:139	Most of non-statutory work is giving advice to people like control , and others , which may not be purely statutory in the sense that is , but the major difference is there 's a time when it 's imposed on when we have to do it .
220074:29	Whereas the Fire Precautions Act just says we have to do it , but it does n't say when .
220115:37	And having given that advice to the pet shop , does it have to be complied with ?
220120:46	It 's up to Social Services , and Social Services may choose , although I have got to say it 's unlikely , to register a children 's or an elderly person 's home despite the fact that we 've given advice that they should n't .
220140:89	Bearing in mind the number of private nursing homes that spring up and erm , er , I mean the sort of privately run places er , presumably the local authorities have to give them a licence to run , but is there no way that it , can the Fire Service , can our officers go and make an inspection ?
220165:48	Social Services are really a help , we could choose to ignore that , I have to say that I 'm not aware of that happening , and I think it 's very unlikely .
220167:101	The other element is that the county 's are so dangerous , and that 's actually quite unusual , they 're so dangerous that we consider they present a risk and it has to be me that considers it presents a risk to life , and I can either restrict the use of premises , but I can prohibit the use entirely .
220173:13	What I have to say really , is that most of those premises present very little risk at all , and , and I think that any change in the implementation of fire safety legislation should be based in prioritization .
220195:45	And I hasten to say it , governments of all persuasions assume it must be being done .
220211:86	That 's not a way of fudging some other cost , the retained fire fighters are recompensed when we provide training for them , because they normally have to lose work or whatever .
220355:31	But some of the children there erm , somebody must have been very , very , optimistic because we put a lot , a lot of presents in there , but anyway I think it was a superb night , and , and , and the meeting of er , to get together in the fire station afterwards , quite , in the Price Room was very good .
220361:160	The ladies concerned I think were very pleased er , erm , I do I think it 's a very good idea , erm , to give a wife 's medal and er , with all the medals , and we ought to provide money for them the amount of waiting about they have to do
220400:18	Chairman , he wo n't have to , it 's like this , he wo n't have to worry as they did when the televisions which caused the last fire in the House of Commons , I mean , set fire to them and er , caused that one .
220400:51	Chairman , he wo n't have to , it 's like this , he wo n't have to worry as they did when the televisions which caused the last fire in the House of Commons , I mean , set fire to them and er , caused that one .
220419:60	I have , item , paragraph one , Mr Chairman , is right to do with the work that has to be done .
220422:59	Item one on M , Mr Chairman , the right of you with the amount of work that has to be done , and the amount of they 're asked for
220521:87	Yes , erm , on paragraph three erm , the , the last sentence erm , where it says without direct access to its own balances , the authority may therefore have to make revised precept in ninety four , ninety five erm , I understand what 's being said there , but any organization needs to actually work within er , a clearly defined budget .
220522:33	Er , the Police Authority last year I think actually had to have an extra nine hundred thousand pounds of spending , the budget was funded by the constituent 's authorities , erm , and we 've already for next year in fact , made available effectively six hundred thousand pounds worth of extra spending by erm , various means , so I would hope that erm , the authority does use as , as much prudence and restraint in its financial affairs as possible , because of the , the effects on all , all concerned .
220585:86	You have very little room for manoeuvre within this service , and the Registrar General has reserve powers to impose services on you , and I would have to advice you it would be virtually , or I would have to say it would be impossible to achieve that ongoing reduction in future years .
220585:126	You have very little room for manoeuvre within this service , and the Registrar General has reserve powers to impose services on you , and I would have to advice you it would be virtually , or I would have to say it would be impossible to achieve that ongoing reduction in future years .
220607:52	Erm , that is n't necessarily the same as saying by the way your section will have to repeat that saving in future years .
220608:92	I think it 's quite legitimate for this Committee to take that twenty thousand because it 's there , and to say to itself , post budget we will have to look at the whole of the areas covered by budget protection to find the replicated twenty thousands in future years , and not just expect it to come from registration .
220629:63	The trouble about that is , it 's now enforced upon us and that 's official target , we have to set priority of fire certificates because we need the money , bluntly , otherwise we have to find it elsewhere , so we give them a priority that they would n't otherwise have .
220629:113	The trouble about that is , it 's now enforced upon us and that 's official target , we have to set priority of fire certificates because we need the money , bluntly , otherwise we have to find it elsewhere , so we give them a priority that they would n't otherwise have .
220667:10	If it has to be found that 's the only way .
220701:10	Now I must admit my first thoughts of it were it really gets my back up for some reason or other .
220712:195	I sold three and one of the reasons why and I think we got tremendous opportunity to develop an enormous part by just going in and speaking to people to explain to and they can relate to write lots and lots of and you can get a good grip we wo n't do it overnight , it is something you have got to develop .
220739:44	There is still , I am sure , of specific areas and you have to highlight those areas and get them out of the way .
220876:181	Yeah the T V could do with a few big ones , alright okay body stopper , they want you to have a T V on and be tempted , depends on what , how it went , to ask them to turn it off but if you ca n't that would upon them then you 'll have to work with it because what you do n't want to be seeing is okay they are there , you 're here and they 're concentrating on this .
220920:69	Yeah , the buyer 's guide but let 's not get bogged down with this , this is n't the problem something we have to do .
220938:49	You can erm by word of mouth recommendations it means that we , we have to spend less money on advertising , now that means that in the long run we can pass that on to the client like yourself
220950:7	You have to learn that script , it 's got to roll off the tongue , if you do n't know the script , you 'll have it you 'll leave it out , you wo n't do it , you have n't planned for tea which means what ?
221001:48	Each part of that particular structure , you 've done a good step one , what must that lead to ?
221014:80	How , how long do you think it 'll take for give up how long will it take before that person feels uncomfortable and has to respond ?
221018:50	By one second , two seconds , they are starting to perspire and they will have to say something unless you get a real swine to sell people , one we sell to , two , the one that says I know the stuff a hope in hell
221039:112	If in the unlikely event , if they want to feel a C C Q , let them have it , do n't , do n't because that person may be a tax he , he buys he has to feel what he 's buying and to deprive him from that you really are up against it .
221042:7	You have to
221051:122	which will be I do n't know about ten o'clock-ish is that a problem the er a copy of a buyer 's guide in for you Before we move into the role play for cycle , what I have to do is show you erm a training video that is produced by the department , you may have seen it before I do n't know
221074:33	This would be the first opportunity that your potential client has to meet you , remember first impressions do count .
221095:112	If there are four to do , so you 'll all again at least twice and the best thing you have is you have more practice er so are you all clear on what you have to do , what you 're allotted to have to sell ?
221095:142	If there are four to do , so you 'll all again at least twice and the best thing you have is you have more practice er so are you all clear on what you have to do , what you 're allotted to have to sell ?
221100:104	Each cycle should take fifty five minutes so we do three sets of role play , well we look at them , look for the cycle to start at quarter past ten first cycle must start at quarter past ten , there four that should be for one o' clock so we commence the third and final role play , come back here and break for lunch and have an hour for lunch final role play at two o' clock .
221101:27	That is everyone clear in what they have to do ?
221254:11	because we had to sit and prepare what we were doing .
221286:42	Means when you can choose when you retire decide you have to retire and you will enjoy proper , you can have an income erm which is going to be erm commensurate with what you are currently earning .
221334:39	I 'm not sure where it is film , we 'll have to just er last week .
221438:7	This must be an ideal situation for you actually cos we 're being , we 're sitting here being recorded and being watched so we 're used to that sort of thing but not particularly conscious of it
221443:23	Because two of them do n't have to be done are they
221498:46	That 's what Joan was saying the other day as a woman you have to be , otherwise you do n't get there .
221621:30	The facts are gonna be something that , I have to write down here soft facts .
221671:33	Erm so your , your state of health er have to go to hospital go to the doctor ?
221694:66	Well it on my doorstep and that makes sense to use it , so I sort of wriggle down there and have to keep me out of er Southampton er Boat Show .
221730:101	There is one basic thing that they need to do , they or their parents , that is pick up the telephone and ring a contact , that 's all they have to do because within here there are people ready to receive those er t telephone enquiries and get the youngsters on the water .
221743:105	I hope you think that this is important more important to you as it were than it is , is to us because you the clubs and the sailing schools really really must take these sorts of messages on board , not perhaps all of that list there but I would pick out erm that the message that we want to get across to young people , I would pick out the words fun , the words challenging , the words safe , alright .
221782:10	Th we must be able to learn from this period , particularly a partial austerity mm but these events are sound events in themselves and that we 're not just doing it for the sake of the sponsor or attracting a sponsor and that it 's not , in itself , completely necessary to have a sponsor otherwise the competition would n't exist .
221811:7	This must be the major object of the Association during my chairmanship is to increase our individual membership which we need so much to re to our representation at a high level .
221813:36	The youngsters are our sea call of the future and we must grasp the initiative with both hands .
221814:31	As my hair turns grey and falls out I must also put in a plug for senior sailors with earlier retirement
221818:7	We must look after not all of the sport , the high flyers , the starters , the beginners and those who just go out for enjoyment and potter .
221819:115	Your council occasionally suffers comments about the age of some of its members but the fact remains that to a man or woman your council members are current sailors or actively involved in the sport and this must be good for sport .
221860:16	The only satisfactory long-term solution must be to secure a hugely increased membership of the Association .
221862:17	I believe that we have got to go for this strategy if we are continue to fight the freedoms which are the root of our yachting .
221866:43	There is no need for any concern at the present time but the problems have got to be addressed because they wo n't go away .
221882:68	Yes ar are not that good but I 'm working at it on a sort of regional basis erm but you may have to keep me here for a very long time in order to achieve it .
221957:8	I have to , I have to make it er perfectly clear that it is not part of the official business of the meeting .
221957:20	I have to , I have to make it er perfectly clear that it is not part of the official business of the meeting .
221989:64	Now I have considerable respect for the House of Commons ' Environment Committee but I think on this occasion they must have been tired and emotional when they wrote that .
221997:98	Perhaps in closing erm I would just er repeat with your permission Ma ' am er a piece from your nineteen ninety er presidential address and it says , as yachtsmen we must care for the environment , it is fair to say that most do but images are created by the bad news .
221999:51	Our craft are mostly environmentally friendly and those with craft that are less so will have to think seriously about improving them .
222072:116	The dry suit is great for winter sailing because you can wear lots of warm layers underneath and the suit keeps them completely dry by means of watertight seals at the wrists and the neck but you must n't forget about the extremities either .
222103:19	Okay Suzanne , now you had to slacken off the halyard to let me tie that last knot so if you could tighten it up again that will pull the sail up to the top of the mast .
222128:71	The rudder and tiller assembly simply slot on to the back of the boat but the important thing to remember is that the tiller must go underneath the rope force before the rudder is clipped on .
222175:89	Now we cross to the other side of the no go area but turning is called tacking , and so to make ground for wind width we have to go in a series of zig-zags , each time turning for about ninety degrees and see that the sail is kept full most of the time only flapping momentarily as the boat turns directly through the eye of the wind .
222192:71	There , that manoeuvre is known as gybing but really it 's as simple as that , sailing downwind you do n't have to change course very often , unlike when we 're sailing upwind with tacking but we need to show you a few more demonstrations about it in quick succession .
222196:47	There 's lots of power in the sail all the time and so you will have to remain agile .
222206:80	On a beat , that is with the sheet pulled in tightly but as we turn on to a ridge you 'll see that we have to ease the sheet out so that the sail stays at the same angle for the wind .
222245:35	Returning in an offshore wind is slightly more complicated as you have to beat back towards the beach .
222259:67	We 'll start down at the far end of what we call the lured mark and from there you 'll have to tack all the way up to this closest one , the windward mark .
222275:18	After the tack she 'll have to put it all in again to accelerate away .
222316:8	You have to pull very slowly and carefully , try to jerk it and you 'll bend or possibly break something .
222345:7	I had to use a lot of rudder to keep sailing on a straight course .
222394:28	In tidal waters like the Channel Islands , you must find out what the tides are doing .
222397:36	That may be affected by the prevailing wind and we 'll have to find a suitable launching site .
222465:27	I think the answer is we must come and stay with you again and then we can
222549:7	I must say I 've only grown two maincrop this year , I 've been clearing some new ground and I 've just grown King Edward and Pink Fir Apple , I 've got the biggest biggest Pink Fir Apples you have ever seen bar none but I 'm coming back to you now Fred , I put to you a few minutes ago , your personal recommendations for the best three or four or five potatoes for the different cooking purposes .
222567:40	I do n't think I 've ever seen a dormouse I must be honest
222601:70	It produces a good number of peaches every August but the greenhouse is in desperate need of replacement and she does n't have to , want to have to put another one in that position so is there anything cheap , she says , that she could do to help the tree to survive and fruit in a large open garden in Preston in Lancashire without the greenhouse , Walter ?
222601:86	It produces a good number of peaches every August but the greenhouse is in desperate need of replacement and she does n't have to , want to have to put another one in that position so is there anything cheap , she says , that she could do to help the tree to survive and fruit in a large open garden in Preston in Lancashire without the greenhouse , Walter ?
222635:22	Well my favourite shrub is , er must be the Charles Austin which is a rather nice one , it 's a cream well scented modern English shrub rose and it grows to about , well up here anyway in Scotland where I am it grows something like erm four to six feet and another one well , erm Aloha , it 's a delicious scented pink and a strong growing rose er fairly upright but erm quite a good one and again it grows to be about five to six feet with us .
222641:10	And that must be our last question for today so can I ask the team for some topical tips Walter ?
222648:38	Good news for us but bad for them and that 'll have to be all for today , we 've been answering some of the queries that have reached us by post .
222716:91	So that answers all those years that I have been conducting these seminars , it answers my question not in the way I was particularly happy about I have to say , but I mean it did answer my question and then it may be them having you know I mean like sort of things I may not be particularly happy with , but maybe it is good that the papers are reflecting what the community wants .
222742:228	Yeah er if you , what was on tonight was er on the , there was a T V programme on tonight called What the Papers Say and the editor Alistaire Campbell was on tonight , he is actually quite left-wing and this paper will , is actually quite vehement about the government , much more than the Sun would ever be , it 's quite interesting , yet that is owned by Murdoch , but I have to say that I think that is only because Murdoch is n't liked in that way since to have
222869:14	Excuse me I have to say Princess Diana yesterday stunned the world announcing that she is to quit public life .
222870:7	I have to admit I quite like this that 's punchy , that 's punchy , straight to the point and I think er you know it 's quaking with emotion .
222883:147	Chairman , thank , thank you very much indeed erm Chairman , I will in fact and er perhaps if I read that in the first instance I have n't circulated it erm if I read that the first instance it will set the of what I have to say .
222884:16	The point that concerned must reaction of the was one that we 've heard many times before who the hell 's taking overall view of this ?
222908:119	The Chairman of the erm that is already occurring , we 've had a number of reports erm already er flooding is based on a tide flap system erm so those you know we 're gonna have to live with that over the years .
223040:10	Well I must say I , I very much it .
223055:107	and the third thing is erm I frankly do n't understand perhaps it 's the same point as er that this below the line item , I mean it 's taken below the line it must come from somewhere .
223083:17	For the moment we have to charge the fee , we cannot waive it , but we have to charge it , but we have to charge it at the level that is set by the government and which is subject to review and er and er Mr has , has drawn our attention to has recently been increased .
223083:55	For the moment we have to charge the fee , we cannot waive it , but we have to charge it , but we have to charge it at the level that is set by the government and which is subject to review and er and er Mr has , has drawn our attention to has recently been increased .
223083:76	For the moment we have to charge the fee , we cannot waive it , but we have to charge it , but we have to charge it at the level that is set by the government and which is subject to review and er and er Mr has , has drawn our attention to has recently been increased .
223086:120	U unfortunately it 's not a perfect system because in relation to mineral applications , whilst as you would expect the largest fees are associated with the largest areas of er application for new mineral working and whilst it has to be admitted that those sorts of applications do take a lot of time in order to process them .
223113:7	One has to be so careful .
223150:64	I 'm serious about that , it grieves me greatly the possibility that he may not hear what the patch has to say .
223161:44	The is interesting because of course planning is an eggshells area where you have to tiptoe delicately through the tulips .
223164:175	I thought that , and I 'm not an expert in but I thought this was a penetrating critique and all goes well for how the department is handling in a very difficult starting situation , a most important matter but there is Mr spoke to me about this paper and er I think we will have to hear what Mr had to say , I do n't know who 's going to report that .
223164:193	I thought that , and I 'm not an expert in but I thought this was a penetrating critique and all goes well for how the department is handling in a very difficult starting situation , a most important matter but there is Mr spoke to me about this paper and er I think we will have to hear what Mr had to say , I do n't know who 's going to report that .
223224:41	Oh yes and er the I pass all the correspondence I have to the County Planning Officer who deals with it with the most enormous efficiency and I hope that he is maintaining liaison with what I call the Rucatse Group which consists of , Neil and Tony and somebody from Crawley who is I think it 's
223253:84	Er that is something which is er a matter of great regret , but because of circumstances er unfortunately is the case and something that we must er address .
223263:114	I understand an and appreciate wh what you 're saying and most grateful to you for that , I think wha what you 're , Neil is saying is is that with we must make sure the time , that this main strategic planning he has to look at , this very important issue , allows sufficient time for mature consideration
223263:150	I understand an and appreciate wh what you 're saying and most grateful to you for that , I think wha what you 're , Neil is saying is is that with we must make sure the time , that this main strategic planning he has to look at , this very important issue , allows sufficient time for mature consideration
223276:19	Item eleven one er I have to say that if you want to discuss item eleven two , the Mid Sussex District Local Plan , I will have to er I shall have to er withdraw and ask er Cliff to chair the meeting .
223276:84	Item eleven one er I have to say that if you want to discuss item eleven two , the Mid Sussex District Local Plan , I will have to er I shall have to er withdraw and ask er Cliff to chair the meeting .
223276:101	Item eleven one er I have to say that if you want to discuss item eleven two , the Mid Sussex District Local Plan , I will have to er I shall have to er withdraw and ask er Cliff to chair the meeting .
223288:9	But I must n't blot my copy book .
223303:46	They may not do them and we could still issue , we would still have to issue the statements of general conformity .
223334:77	er in regard to er th the quote there has been no agreement on the line , that refers to the fact that agreement has to be m erm come about with the actual erm East Sussex County Council and Surrey County Council and that er although a joint meeting of Planning and Highways what , some two years ago , took a view as to the line , that has n't actually meant that there is agreement at this stage where the line can be implemented and I would have thought that 's what that refers to .
223405:185	I , I , I think Chairman that on the , the case to which you refer as , as I recollect it was very much on the specific wording of the er restriction which erm was found to fail , because it applied to a number of houses and not to a specific property and er clearly care will have to be given by the districts that happens in imposing conditions to make sure that it will erm appertain to each individual property within a development so that the occupancy condition can be can be informed .
223410:10	Perhaps we have to get it into the erm strategy agenda again I mean we we have had a go at it , but probably inadequately .
223419:7	I have to say there was one piece information I picked up yesterday asking and we 're talking about the rural areas I think in this discussion , the rural viability , rather then er urban .
223426:150	Basically erm I agree with what you say but that the County Council itself of course is a landowner of erm some quite attractive erm areas of land that could be used for below cost housing , but the problem in the past has been that they always had to sell erm at the market price .
223440:21	Yeah , sorry Chairman I must
223461:29	I think we shall just on the margin have to leave it as it is .
223465:7	I must just quickly stress on looking at it very closely last night that only one was in West Sussex .
223474:168	I was delighted to see that th on the if you are now considering buying extra funds to see an encouragement residential home places There is however an important issue where you get shall we say a quality development in a rural area , and I mean a quality development , which would be probably has to be above the rates quoted here where talk a discussion with the owners because they may not be available to local people and that does concern me a bit in rural areas .
223488:12	Once again I must congratulate the officers for the excellent budget .
223508:33	But my main Chairman asking questions on what the er director has to say .
223513:15	Erm , you 'll have to bear with me because I just marked the page as I went through .
223594:47	So you know just picking up Mr ' s point , I h we must n't confuse , I mean I agree that quantity is one of the measures of quality but it 's not the only one .
223595:63	You , you can put more resources into things and not necessarily provide something better so I think that one has to try and do the two together .
223596:116	Erm s that 's my general s there 's no doubt that there are a great deal of activities there as always of course when one is spending a lot of new money quite rapidly , one has to monitor it very carefully to make sure that it 's being effectively spent , and I 'm sure the director and this committee will continue to do that .
223609:33	As far as mental health is concerned , Mr surely must be living in another age .
223690:20	In other words , they would have to meet the difference .
223695:176	That would we feel is certainly in a coordinating way and if somebody for instance er say you 've got a husband and wife living together , one of them suddenly becomes handicapped in a particular way , what we are planning to do is trying to develop programmes which will enable the carer to have to go on training at the County Council 's expense to enable them to look after somebody in their own homes and it 's a type of thing we want to develop .
223730:59	Erm , we are aware of a number of those take place and if necessary we 'll have to enter into discussions with the district councils er about and there is an element of give and take there .
223734:25	And the question of allergy doctors I must confess is outside my remit .
223743:38	So we 've er we felt that was we only had to cope with if the worst came to the worst .
223758:69	I think the committee as a whole wanted to be cautious because as has been said earlier our main prime responsibility must be to those who need rest home or nursing home care and have nobody else to fund them .
223772:56	Indeed , the government is about to bring in new regulations which will mean that the hospitals must nominate a named person for each patient who is responsible for liaising with us on discharge .
223816:31	Thank you all for attending , oh we do have to formally , formally move into part two and that 's for one purpose only , and that 's to approve the minutes of the last meeting
223823:218	Overall during last year , this is to the end of , of November actually because fin figures are n't available for the end of the year , the reduction was four point nine percent , which compares with four point three percent in the previous year , so not only are they still going down , they 're actually going down slightly more than they were in the previous year and that must be encouraging .
223825:124	As far as the capital receipt money goes , not all , it 's not been possible to spend all of that this year because the development of some of these urban traffic calming schemes is actually very complicated and we 've had to re-think some of them .
223882:37	I mean , the point about this is that actually I must emphasise it 's a needs based assessment , both in allocating the overall amount of money that goes to the various areas and er those of you who 've already looked at it will see that area three seems to have a disproportionately high amount of the money .
223987:63	Well , it 's a rather complicated thing but I think we need the cameras and I think we must go ahead and get them into so that we can see if they work as well in in terms of road safety as they have in trials elsewhere , because the results that have been obtained in London and also in Cornwall and Nottingham have been very very impressive , as you know .
224036:115	What I , I intend to do is to , I think it would be unfortunate if , as the result of a major development which is actually funding this new junction , the County Council then has to pick up the bill for other ameliorating effects a little bit further on the network .
224039:74	If it becomes a question for the County Council to actually refund it then I think the report is right in that we must consider whether the needs for traffic calming here are any m higher or lower than other requests for traffic calming elsewhere in the county because you will be aware there are an awful lot of requests for traffic calming .
224051:12	Also , I have to report the receipt of another letter of objection which I think the county surveyor is wa aware about but does not alter his recommendation to the report .
224061:7	I have to say it 's not the current proposal to , to complete the bottom link of the scheme to the timescale which is associated with the erm er waste plant at .
224096:82	They hear the access road is coming , they are not consulted , they do n't know anything about it and over the years again I must reiterate .
224183:21	If it means that it has to go on the other side of the road , could we please have that .
224249:42	Erm , so the pr the actual cost of the scheme I think has to be borne in mind there .
224255:52	Could the County Surveyor just confirm that it 's a statutory requirement that all these schemes do have to be publicly ?
224282:146	We are looking at Road , that 's the assurance , we are considering that er as er an extension but there is n't funding available for that within the present programme so we will come back with a proposal for Road but it will have to be compared with other big schemes so the scheme we are proposing now is the one that 's before you , which er I wo n't comment on unless people have questions .
224299:148	And when you the schools , the shops in that area , I 'm not only surprised it was n't considered in the first place , but secondly , it is the key to the whole scheme and er although I 'm quite happy to move the erm recommendation , I must say that I have a very very deep concern regarding Road .
224310:55	is a vast neighbourhood and it 's got no outlet , where everything goes up and everything has to come back out again and all that goes along a small country road .
224332:15	Road we will have to consider though against other schemes also competing for the next waive of funding .
224359:61	Erm , the irony of the sort of split responsibility is that er one of the things that we have to obviously bear in mind with any future in erm extension of residents ' parking schemes is the cost , and er it 's interesting that the district council 's off-street er parking account erm for the area is , has got a reasonable surplus , and er well we as an authority 're responsible for , for off-street parking as well .
224482:105	I think a lot of people who suffer from asthma type diseases here do suffer quite severely erm because of this and I think that at some point we 're probably going to have to , to look at it and try and devise a system which , which allows us to pick up the grass .
224624:7	There must be nothing on it .
224642:9	No it must be a year old or something
224651:7	You must 've got an extra sheet than me because one of the things I was moaning about this morning erm , maybe you 've got a different
224872:22	that 's right , yes you have to tell them what to look out for kind of thing
224979:154	erm , right okay , well I 'll look into that , but I think that serves a good point , right moving back to the agenda , erm , note of meeting fifth of August , erm , anything for those of you who were there , that Cath had to run away , that was one of your crises you were having
225011:81	No I was n't so much disappointed as that I was disappointed that there was only five would be sponsors and that it was we had to give out
225035:36	because I did n't know whether I was going to have to bring ours up or not because I
225059:9	but we must sort of all pull in together as a situation in Scotland now that which really concerns me and I 'd
225179:9	so it must come off very easily
225180:4	must come off very easily somehow
225201:18	aha , and we will have to think about some sort of contingency fund around to , for replacements whatever
225273:28	Well that 's something we would obviously have to sort of , I mean maybe it 's something where you know I mean with the
225277:41	which I suppose it might be difficult to see what had to be arranged for that with you there 's a regularity , but you know the Trone is obviously a
225285:11	and the theatre must know when you 're actually going to see the , the show
225345:33	Yes I think that 's something we would have to kind of balance up is , is that kind of making
225388:21	I think we 'll really have to be cautious and that one
225432:16	because we 're gonna have to know that in advance because the describers have to be asked if they will be will they be able to travel ?
225432:45	because we 're gonna have to know that in advance because the describers have to be asked if they will be will they be able to travel ?
225557:52	so what 's the position in the future , is it , are we going to have to go through that every time or ?
225562:7	I must admit I was
225695:41	and I 'm just wondering if maybe , maybe we will just have to do a wee bit of work and try and get something on the go to see if somebody will
225732:38	I think the other side of the Festival as well , you must n't lose track of , is that the Festival
225778:66	out so you just , so maybe just , maybe , I 've taken a slight hard line to say no , people have got to make a wee bit effort too , but maybe in fact
225780:98	to go back , because to do this to get to this stage and find we 're not getting our audiences then , if that 's the answer we 'll just have to find the solution .
225782:29	Is there not two separate problems that we have to find them first and then the , then worrying about getting people to the theatre
225830:45	I mean you can organize every kind of thing why does it have to involve us ?
225920:53	Iris 's job , but I really wanted to raise that this time , we really have to have someone very , very quickly to protest , call it what you like
225922:14	but we 're gonna have to have somebody
225995:5	had to keep dragging them off to the toilet , they 'd never seen blind children you see they 'd all seen adults
226094:12	Yeah , I must admit I do .
226485:12	But you do have to look at looking at you know , as I 've said across the five years .
226544:40	Weeks fifteen to twenty one is subject specific and all the details that have to come in and make up a record of achievement .
226551:75	Just bear with me a moment we can stay the same as we on subject specifics at the moment , we do n't have to change that , I 'm just trying to think in the light of national curriculum and what 's happening
226553:12	we do n't have to change anything yet .
226557:68	there was a big discussion about the standard report , it wo n't cover five years and I said it does n't have to cover five years , it never has done it 's only covered four cos we what we do in year eleven is different anyway .
226566:7	Yes has to be finished there .
226570:24	But they 're ongoing you do n't have to worry about
226607:66	But i i it 's yo you ca n't do it this term because maths is never ready it always has to be done erm next term .
226612:7	I had to keep checking the only one I had to keep checking was Dick 's .
226612:33	I had to keep checking the only one I had to keep checking was Dick 's .
226619:104	You 've got a frown Sandra , on the notice board above the fridge it says this is to be included in next years record of achievement which I presume will have to go into yours as well after my year
226621:7	there has to be something said about attendance .
226622:26	It ca n't be just figures it has to be some sort of er summation does n't it as well or not ?
226633:15	Exactly , so it has to be written , some sort of written
226835:163	So they 're going to be the conscience and the parenting for that year group and I also suggested that at that time , I think what Rob 's doing is getting the children to look at themselves er , as regards what their strengths and weaknesses are and the P S D have got to clarify that .
226844:60	I do n't really know where I , or I know where I 'm going but I have to take the troops with me I had er , I got you see what is parts of a I A P compact certificate it might in fact , if the boss would let me do , if I could do an industry in December right ?
226859:36	with the form teacher and yo and you know that has to be fairly fluid to let i incorporate their ideas erm but I would then put out , you know , week seven er , you know review what er , a record of achievement is it might be what can write try your personal statement about yourself .
226902:246	Include it in that , those twelve weeks because I know it 's , you know , a bit erm I would try and see if I could set up some sex education with the health centre and the , you know , that she used to take them and they went through contraception and condoms and whatever at the , and she used to take them down for an afternoon it might well be that they have to miss a lesson
226909:103	an in and ecta er , an industry day done where you know , it 's about the qualities needed in the young person , they have a certificate that they 're going to have to say they 've got these qualities , right ?
226920:12	No , I must do that
226964:37	Er , and that term there because after the half term they have to start making their choices is n't that right ?
226984:22	commas individual teachers and we do have to be very careful about that .
226990:31	for one week , say , or perha , probably have to be two cos you
227035:31	Right , but one of the things we have to remember is , and I know it 's sort of a sha , but you have the experience of last year and , that has to be shared you know to to sort of cut the corners yo you 've gotta pass it back a year or up a year , whichever whatever happens and you 've made a very valid comment there and you need to make note of that that , you know somehow you have to work round Rob to get it
227035:108	Right , but one of the things we have to remember is , and I know it 's sort of a sha , but you have the experience of last year and , that has to be shared you know to to sort of cut the corners yo you 've gotta pass it back a year or up a year , whichever whatever happens and you 've made a very valid comment there and you need to make note of that that , you know somehow you have to work round Rob to get it
227035:274	Right , but one of the things we have to remember is , and I know it 's sort of a sha , but you have the experience of last year and , that has to be shared you know to to sort of cut the corners yo you 've gotta pass it back a year or up a year , whichever whatever happens and you 've made a very valid comment there and you need to make note of that that , you know somehow you have to work round Rob to get it
227039:31	a minute , is there any reason why he has got to do that , because he has no other contact with year nine at all ?
227059:15	and then it all had to be scrapped and by the middle
227060:7	They had to do it again .
227081:68	You 're gonna have three huge curriculum areas , maths , English and science they 'll have taken their SATS we have got to report on them
227084:247	I 'm not quite sure yet cos we 're this chicken and egg which starts first I think we 're gonna look at a an an interim type report in year nine a quicker type report I ca n't remember what it 's , it 's written down in my other diary because what I do n't want to happen is to , people to have a onerous report at the end of year nine , cos they 're gonna have to do a report there now
227088:39	or and the cho , it has , this is , it has to be there by , we can actually just do a national curriculum report which gives a level , that 's all !
227152:17	You know , I had to go and and get trained in a separate
227166:7	It has to be er , that particular trend .
227184:7	We had to do it later and later .
227208:59	One of the problems is you ne , it 's alright saying something on the environment , you have to tighten up what it is you 're gonna do .
227342:7	We must stop talking about that .
227403:35	We 've got certain rules that say all children must sit certain exams at certain times , it has n't been possible to do it in the labs
227421:79	you would have more information on that than Milvia would have for that , after they done the SATS and they 're marked reports have to be sent out , we must report at the end of key stage three .
227421:102	you would have more information on that than Milvia would have for that , after they done the SATS and they 're marked reports have to be sent out , we must report at the end of key stage three .
227435:9	All we have to do is report to the parents once a year it does n't say that everything has to be on the report sheet at the same time it may well be some information goes at one particular time and some at another .
227435:63	All we have to do is report to the parents once a year it does n't say that everything has to be on the report sheet at the same time it may well be some information goes at one particular time and some at another .
227436:29	I 'm sure it says a written comment must be made for each subject .
227459:103	Now you 're alright , that 's everything should happen there but it is not physically impossible but it 's gonna put staff under a lot of stress and we 're gonna have to play the game of making it workable .
227496:9	Right , must be me .
227706:23	So that 's why I 've had to fit in .
227874:79	comments fair that he did , he did come in twice and se the third time he said I 'm sorry I had to .
227955:25	We will need , we we 'll have to work on this which will involve the philosophy of having er perhaps a joint statement and perhaps on putting a short personal statement in .
227992:22	Teacher , the for , the teacher must comment
227996:24	within the department , you do n't have to , I would hope everybody could
228140:7	It has to be done there then .
228201:44	One of the problems is this thing about some are being punished and have to there
228261:39	You can actually now I 'm sure som so somebody must have the skills on an A five sheet to have it halved with a an internal diary er three of those you 're , it 's cost you the five bits of paper and two staples !
228286:121	that 's all it was , like the old booklets and it used have week beginning Monday , Tuesday , Wednesday , Thursday , Friday all the way along and they used to write their homework in , what they had to do
228321:10	If they have to .
228329:9	But you have to be careful that by doing something like that you 're not making life completely onerous
228391:7	They have to .
228392:152	of getting i the some sort of a working a relationship a at a more detailed where in between , we 're between the staff the teaching staff and the tutor , the form tutors help the teaching staff , especially and say in your department where you you 're gonna have to give them more homework .
228393:10	I would have to say on a personal point of view , no cos I will deal quite
228401:10	But you have to agree , I mean
228424:14	then I 'm gonna have to take them back in again !
228453:199	to be with my friends although they let me sit with me friends so they 're good really so I 'm hoping that I should be able to get back on a Wednesday because er , that 's the only day really I can go , I go to Barn Mead on a Thursday as a rule you see , but yesterday I had to have a day off to go out , I had an invite out
228461:159	Yeah , yeah was kind , it was kind of them , yes and we went all round the shops and er I thoroughly enjoyed it and in the new Co-Op as well you know , I thoroughly enjoyed it but he took me in the car so that we did n't have to hang about you see
228463:70	so I ca n't get cold so I get , sometimes I get a coronary if I get very cold so I have to keep warm see but otherwise dear erm I think the New Town is really great I do
228471:127	Well we only had Epping hospital dear , that 's all we had , there was only Epping and er they were er you know done what they could very good and we had a dentist , oh dentist you had to go er , oh right to Old Harlow , up er
228473:72	I think it was Old Harlow or Hoddesdon somewhere I used to go , I know a long way off we had to go because there was n't anything round here was there ?
228498:25	Yeah , did a lot of people have to go in homes in those days , or is it just like today ?
228500:79	and the warden was there in her dressing gown trying to get her up and she could n't get her up this morning , so she had to get help , one of the workmen came along and helped from the top terrible to say though it is , yeah , never mind , they get over it
228501:41	What did the shops used to be like cos you used to have to go to the Old Town did n't you ?
228605:50	Yes it started off at er twelve sockets in these house and that er , it must of gone down to about er eight sockets in some houses .
228637:7	there must of been a thousand thousands sold of this , done I should think
228752:128	There 's a definite fashion of yes , yes , the only thing is , is that people are not erm , er religious bound by the fashion , they do n't , sort of say like well I think we 'll have to change our porch light it looks old fashioned compared to the one next door , erm
228768:50	did you ever have a desire of er a wall bracket where you did n't have to chase in the flex that it actually ran up from er a socket in the wall ?
228803:164	Oh er , usually pale er , pale pink er again the ever cream colour which seem to , you could of painted the fifties with cream I think , erm and erm pale blue , powder blue colour er , they were all pale colours , er pale yellow or an amber colour , they had to be pale otherwise they would n't let the light through
228824:24	Oh I , I think one had to consider erm , I , I 'd have to ask them the size of the room , what , what sort of a room it was , er , it was no use getting the fitting which erm was either far too big for the room in it 's , in it 's physical size
228824:51	Oh I , I think one had to consider erm , I , I 'd have to ask them the size of the room , what , what sort of a room it was , er , it was no use getting the fitting which erm was either far too big for the room in it 's , in it 's physical size
228925:159	Anyway , forty six and then we had no house , at all , because my mother had died and my father , we said to my father you leave if you want to we should be alright we 'll find somewhere to go and we did n't and we had to have a Nissan hut for about a year , supplied by the Council
228951:66	It was a mixed development with very much the emphasis on Corporation staff at that time er and of course they had to house the , got house
228952:9	But they had to house you did n't they ?
229022:9	So you had to pick it up and carry it outside ?
229023:11	Well we had to drag it and
229076:109	Well the difference was like moving from purgatory into heaven really , because er in the Nissan hut I had one tap of cold water , that 's all , every bit of water had to be heated on a gas stove , and every bit of water for a bath had to be heated in an old fashioned er boiler in which you lit the fire under and of course when you came here we had a ni an electric cooker , er straight away
229076:158	Well the difference was like moving from purgatory into heaven really , because er in the Nissan hut I had one tap of cold water , that 's all , every bit of water had to be heated on a gas stove , and every bit of water for a bath had to be heated in an old fashioned er boiler in which you lit the fire under and of course when you came here we had a ni an electric cooker , er straight away
229125:169	You can see furniture , you can see old houses , Arthur Neagus going round all these old houses , you can see a lot of things now , that the normal public never would see in the , the ordinary man in the street probably never saw them at one time , but I think this must of made a difference to people .
229144:9	We had to take the door off there , there used to be a door on there , but to get this long sideboard in we had to take the door off
229144:83	We had to take the door off there , there used to be a door on there , but to get this long sideboard in we had to take the door off
229150:32	Oh , dear he 's been dead , ten it must of been the ten , this is eighty two , seventy two , about sixty five I should think about sixty five
229183:33	and the erm , when you moved in obviously you had to use it
229219:23	so it 's a rare occasion have to use it , but I probably have to have one with me all , for the rest of my life .
229219:47	so it 's a rare occasion have to use it , but I probably have to have one with me all , for the rest of my life .
229325:29	And then it just became a drug that I had to take for every day use .
229326:9	Erm , had to take it to feel normal .
229336:82	I 've got two young sons as well , erm they two got took off me into foster care , and that was when I really had to decide it was the either the drugs or the children .
229340:94	year but the end result came when the two children did get took into foster care erm , that 's when I realized that it was a problem and I had to do something about it .
229343:84	I admire them for being able to sit there in front of everybody and say they actually , what they 've been through because it must have been sheer hell er , trying to come off and withdrawal symptoms , I mean , I do n't know much about it cos I 've never taken well I smoke
229344:41	and I take a drink , but hard drugs misused drugs it just must be shu he sheer hell !
229373:16	I mean , nobody has to speak who does n't want to .
229382:7	we have to try and divert their attention .
229401:7	They must have terrible programmes !
229458:24	One thing that I think we have to be very careful about , if we did legalize cannabis there would be a proportion of adolescents who would get a great kick out of it , but there would those who do n't get the kick because it 's not illegal .
229466:18	I think we really have to look at the Dutch experience and
229482:25	Well I just wonder you , there has got to be some kind of relationship between the fact that most people who take drugs live in really run down deprived areas .
229483:29	I mean , I think tha that you have to look at that .
229489:56	Oh well , you know No , I do n't think that , but I think that you have to I mean there has to some kind of relationship between I 'm not saying it 's anything to do with the personalities or anything like that but
229489:72	Oh well , you know No , I do n't think that , but I think that you have to I mean there has to some kind of relationship between I 'm not saying it 's anything to do with the personalities or anything like that but
229633:20	I mean you do n't have to take drugs !
229677:59	I do n't think we could be completely drug-free , I mean obviously medical conditions dictate that you have to take medi , medicines
229791:7	You have to make sure you 've removed the er tetrodotoxin gland before you start eating , and in fact each year there are deaths in Japan from er inexpert preparation of the Puffer Fish .
229827:12	As indeed it has to if the action potential is to occur .
230044:7	We have got to allow God to do his work in his way and in his time .
230162:41	Notice also , that there is no evidence or suggestion that they had to wait for th for this baptism , for this infilling of the Holy Spirit .
230164:153	That is why I I I mentioned those mar , those remarks right at the beginning , God will never ever send another pentecost , the only people that God told to wait were those early disciples to wait in Jerusalem until the Holy Spirit came and they had to wait for ten days from the ascension of Jesus until the Holy Spirit came .
230171:9	then you have got to wait until I do that .
230173:100	But once I have the thing and make it available , and say here is the gift that I promised it 's yours , it 's available , then , all you have to do is come and take it .
230177:48	He does not suggest , there is no suggestion in the New Testament that we have got to tarry , and wait , and long and , and so on for it , it 's there available to receive .
230228:12	We do n't have to get to a certain stage of holiness .
230229:12	We do n't have to get to a certain stage of sinlessness , before God will give to us the Holy Spirit .
230336:15	You certainly do n't have to be a bible scholar to read this chapter and realize that perhaps the key word in it is the word lost .
230374:28	It 's alright dealing with sinners but you must deal with them on your terms , and in , on your home ground .
230381:53	But there are some parables that Jesus ac explained for the simple reason he did n't have to explain them .
230524:18	And just as the shepherd had to go out and look for it , and search for it .
230664:7	I have to sketch curves This sort of thing .
230810:18	you d you 'd have to find Y .
231036:12	when you have to
231139:16	well okay we 'll have to bring the three over to this side , and take the fourth root , .
231144:39	You can draw Y squared equals X , and all you have to do is say well , I can draw the other way round .
231156:18	Erm you do n't have to do that very often , but it is sometimes , it fits .
231168:13	Oh you 'll have to
231170:10	you 'll have to do them all you 'll have to undo
231170:35	you 'll have to do them all you 'll have to undo
231259:43	If it 's a physical body , to change speed , it 'll have to have to brake .
231259:50	If it 's a physical body , to change speed , it 'll have to have to brake .
231328:39	in our mock , we had like those four pictures , and you had to say which was
231329:34	It comes up time and time again , and you have to know the difference between the different types .
231400:11	Then the you have to have y how far the car has travelled ,
231560:61	Okay , and you 've done , you 've done that on one bit of the fraction , so you must do it on the top as well .
231659:9	So you have to put the south ?
231815:42	I , I , I would n't have given that a chance , I must admit I would never have backed it .
232369:14	Yeah , well you have to sign it .
232394:6	and had to run away , sort of .
232542:20	And I said he 'd have to pay extra for the minibus hire .
232544:17	And obviously , they 'll have to still give the deposit .
232773:15	Oh , I 'll have to see wh she 's going to ring me this afternoon and say whether they can do it in the S C R. I 'm gonna try and persuade her that they can , because there are only forty people at this dinner and they 'll look stupid in the middle of the dining hall .
232777:51	But it 's the way she 's saying oh I 'm so sorry but I have to go back on it when she 's agreed to something .
232805:56	Yeah , well she was going on about bringing lots of money into the college but she might have to pay two hundred and twenty quid for a barn dance band if she 's not careful .
232839:80	it was an hour late , which it was late enough for us to not to know if it was coming , so we had to go and get another P A , otherwise we 'd have gone to get , there was no other option .
232873:46	No , you said you were there for half past five , because you had to get there before half past five in order to book it .
232874:16	We had , we had to get there before six , when they shut , we had to go at half past five , .
232874:54	We had , we had to get there before six , when they shut , we had to go at half past five , .
232875:21	Well I was told you had to get there before half past five .
232951:27	that is against the law , because they have to have access to that cupboard in case there is a fire .
233157:24	You get a societies pack , and have to fill all these names in .
233238:14	Well you 'll have to wait , we 're busy now .
233277:34	and someone and we 've now been told that we have to pay for it , and I
233370:4	have to go to Executive Committee to discuss that . .
233430:64	Better use of machinery and tractor and erm farmers are at risk of I know that manufacturers who could have to progress these capital to get better returns .
233476:67	Right why should we be bothered about protectionism y' know why is G A T so important presumably there must be gainers as well as losers from protectionism so the gainers and the losers domestic farmers gainers or losers ?
233493:243	Now it says on average for , and then essentially we looked at the three main support of erm protectionist powers , like the E E C , U S A and Japan right , and they said that on average alright for every one dollar benefit alright for every one dollar benefit , one agricultural support , right it actually costs right one one fifty dollars of the general statistics in order to give a pounds worth of support to domestic farmers , we er have to find one pounds fifty right .
233532:85	Right in that case its probably a better idea if we go out after the exams , if you want , I mean , do n't you do n't have to
233536:10	We 'll have to try figure out a time when you 're all available .
233575:11	We then have to er , determine the expected value of T minus three and the price of T minus two and we then use the same rule substitute it in there , right , we could repeat , repeatedly substitute into the expected value , right in that manner like we did in , in the er , the symmetry between adaptive expectations and partial adjustment type offices .
233599:107	Right , so that 's the digression over and done with it 's pretty fascinating stuff okay , you 'll you 'll need that in the in erm in your Q M project if you have to apply one to a particular problem .
233607:80	So it 's the , the most widely used supply response model in the entire universe , alright , and as a result of it 's popularity you have to learn it as well .
233703:58	' Cos the thing about rate cards is that if the rate card is there you do n't have to go and get special authorisations or , you quote them the rate card .
233728:52	So , if you do n't take that out , it means that effectively you 're gonna have to have another procedure somewhere that 's going to cover rate cards .
233732:34	So , if we do n't take this out we have to do something about .
233738:20	We 're quite clear we have to have provisional guidelines which say with , what level of seniority is required to authorise a quotation of the values .
233741:54	Right , so when in two point four it says er , a copy of the quotation must be signed by an authorised researcher .
233751:54	I do n't know how other people are doing the guidelines but by definition the divisional guidelines must n't say , must define who the authorised people are , or those .
233751:64	I do n't know how other people are doing the guidelines but by definition the divisional guidelines must n't say , must define who the authorised people are , or those .
233753:10	Obviously it must define the
233760:75	I 'm not clear about the , the sentence in case a repeat costing 's copy of the quotation given to the client must be signed by an authorised researcher .
233848:33	I mean , we just , we just do n't have to keep changing it and talking about it .
233927:125	This was the thing that came up previously about er , dispatch of a report not being recorded anywhere , because of that was a compliment slip which a photocopy was n't kept and so we erm , therefore have to have a note made on the client contact form to say it 's gone .
233928:15	This is gonna have to be a general reminder to , a general point to all researchers because they wo n't know that , I 'm sure .
233931:13	But if we have to do that .
233933:31	It is a major new point that if we have to prove we 've sent , sent things out then that means
233998:30	So point one does not apply to access , have to have .
234090:176	We will have a new procedure called Continuous and Non-Standard Surveys which says that they will follow the basic procedures , except where this does n't make sense , and if it does n't make sense the job will have in it 's Master Job File a statement of how , it does comply with whatever it has to deal with .
234124:57	But Rita in her own department has got the document that she sends so the researcher does n't have to take the bit of paper round to everybody and get their research approval form signed .
234140:36	Well he does that on every questionnaire , but he still has got to get someone to double check it .
234143:64	Yes , I think that as Richard said we need to agree if quality is to continue we have to write some Kathy procedures .
234150:15	Erm , I will have to look at them
234210:52	I would , in that , in the light of well , actually no we do n't have to .
234260:120	I propose Elizabeth that you circulate Jenny 's reprocedures to everyone but we do n't know with them , that we will read them prior to the next meeting and agree them at the meeting papers turning I have got to assess papers turning take one .
234266:48	Suggestions , in preparation for the next meeting , for those procedures that we still have to review , the procedure owners are going to put the information to us in one of two ways , if it is a minor modification procedure small changes of wording things need to be uncontroversial , we will resite the procedure with red line and strike out in the way that Jenny procedures have been prepared and circulate before the meeting .
234291:68	I will run as quickly as I can through the minutes of the last meeting just raising those things which still have to be actioned .
234318:19	Every so often senior level people must go to files to check that things have been correctly , you need to continue to do it , , Action Divisional Quality Managers .
234380:7	It must have been reference for Jenny to be
234494:45	Jenny has given me notes on , on one issue here which I must admit I have n't had a chance to read yet and it 's about house style , about both manual .
234517:8	you have to call for those in favour intention will you now call for a vote for those against
234548:107	Isle of and they sh what she went on to say is erm I hope to redress this in the shortly in other words she 's shortly going to but I must say I like the expression long fingering you know bloody idle you know .
234606:52	Well nobody 's really saying in case when any of us sign it , we must sign excluding the written work
234643:97	was a little girl on her fifteenth birthday and has it it 's like an M O T Certificate , only it 's an M O L Certificate for life that you have to do after your sixty five .
234654:34	Right I 'll read you this piece and you 'll have to forgive my facsimile of a Herts. accent .
234804:99	Yeah , I I wrote the thing as you remember about eighteen months ago , but it had no conflict in it you know we 're all the same and stories must have conflict , so I got the house to burst the ceiling on the wife
234841:31	Right , well the time 's passing we will have to push on .
234940:27	We do use new writers , but they have to compete with these other sources .
234966:45	So if ever you read work apiece , and re-submit it , you must change the title because if if you send it in , they look up to see if they 've seen that title before , if it was rejected before it will be rejected automatically .
234967:28	So if we do a work you must change the title .
235053:17	So I mean you have to send one copy , unless they take the bother of the copy they have received may gone to somebody else .
235163:80	Art had always tried to give back what he had gained in life , he felt grateful for what he felt he had to be given , some said he 'd achieved a great deal , but in his heart he felt fate had dealt him with him gently and you have to make the most of the lo of the card life deals you .
235163:168	Art had always tried to give back what he had gained in life , he felt grateful for what he felt he had to be given , some said he 'd achieved a great deal , but in his heart he felt fate had dealt him with him gently and you have to make the most of the lo of the card life deals you .
235273:32	Right the other thing Ann you you really must get given you pieces of titles you know because that should steer you into it you know the title should be be the first peg you hang your hat on , that 's the first thing .
235298:40	He was despatched off the end at great speed and the viewing had to end there and then .
235458:10	I really must finish the rest of it which I have n't done at the moment , because I 've been doing other things .
235560:9	We have to pay the , er , ninety two , three percentages , which were fifteen point two per cent and nine point eight per cent , so there 's an additional element there , and also we have to deal with erm , the additional cash that goes to grant maintained schools , who went grant maintained prior to the first of April nineteen ninety-two .
235560:121	We have to pay the , er , ninety two , three percentages , which were fifteen point two per cent and nine point eight per cent , so there 's an additional element there , and also we have to deal with erm , the additional cash that goes to grant maintained schools , who went grant maintained prior to the first of April nineteen ninety-two .
235562:82	The estimate for ninety=four , ninety- five , is that there will be some one point three eight five million pounds required , but I er , have to say , that we have not , as in previous years , we have not at this stage received from the D F E er , details of of how the er indirect element of A N G will be calculated for next year , so the requirement may differ er in in due time .
235608:23	The amount of money that we have to pay out , is er obviously detract from the education budget .
235617:12	What we have to realise , it is taking a disproportion of money , amount of money , out of Lincolnshire 's education budget .
235631:131	It 's not a case of being paranoid , it 's a case of seeking fairness for all the school children , and then some of them receiving disproportional , you know higher , er amounts of money , then that must be seen to be unfair , and I 'm certainly well supported in that .
235712:72	It takes no account of the er er government requirements for er this coming year , and having said that , I I must accept that the overall increase proposed for erm , ninety- four , five , er is only three point three per cent .
235790:17	We had , we had to conservative speakers so far , erm , and Councillor Brock seem to me , in a sense to be summing up that phrase about knowing the price of everything and the value of nothing , because there was the the the es essential arithmetical calculation about percentages , and savings .
235791:192	No mention about the difficult task that the County Council 's got in living within a budget , a capping level of three hundred and seventy million , and it would be reasonable , in in a , in a , in a sense that when somebody 's proposing opposition to a budget , it gives some indication as to what within the budget , would have to be cut .
235876:263	We did , at the time , when the expenses were incurred , we gave it , that we were opposed to all the increases that were being made , we still maintain that policy , and I believe that there is a time when we should be be in approval , that we in fact , expending money on new active members is wrong , when in fact , have the cut backs , because at the end of the day , people of Lincolnshire have to pay for these additional expenses incurred to elected members .
235891:30	quite a substantial , er amount of money which has got to be financed from my own funds on that .
235904:136	Thank you , Mr Chairman , erm , I 'm here to say , it 's quite true to say that it does vary from year to year , on er , what our programme is , but er , we we also have to face it , that er , com compared with some other areas , both east midlands and nationally , we do not have the traffic , and this does go against our for T A. Er , the the traffic on our roads
235965:24	I think that the point , has to be made that when we 've had a transport supplementary grant decision and settlement as poor as this one , then it really is about trying to protect and enhance the people of Lincolnshire and the road network , rather than just for once , party politics , because I ca n't honestly believe that the conservatives would actually , feel that this is a fair , reasonable settlement .
235994:11	We shall have to live with it , because er I I do n't think that any hope of any redress next year , but the got to be established of a different system , of me a different methodology for the foreseeable years , if we 're going to get those schemes through that you supported wholeheartedly and congratulated us and for bringing forward the new road schemes for er the that that that that you so approved so warmly yesterday .
236003:7	She must realise that the conservatives are in opposition .
236045:102	In Paragraph one oh nine , and one ten , th , I do actually draw your attention to two areas , though I think that members amongst all the issues that we have to deal with erm , to bear in mind in particular , and indeed the first one , probably the most important , in the sense of the longer term financial indications to reduce the extension of it is , limits that are being imposed upon local government generally , and of course here in Lincolnshire in particularly , in particular .
236067:110	Er , your officers have always , extremely cooperative in that way , and that they 're a particular group of officers , they do n't like to agree with everything that we say , and we have to go with robust discussions .
236082:125	It 's absolutely clear that the public body should be doing work for private sector organisations , and er , to my knowledge , Lincolnshire County Council have not been to that particular erm , definition , although other authorities do and I have had to stop other authorities undertaking contracts where they are er private sector organisations .
236095:7	I must admit , weak option , but its an easy option .
236098:101	are rather different , if the builder wants us to borrow on their behalf , that 's one thing , whether we should borrow on our behalf , is a question that one has to .
236111:11	You 'll have to write to Lady Anyone else wish to comment on
236141:71	Final reason , is that fo for borrowing , is that we could take a view , that borrowing in a particular year has to take account of the of the valuable circumstances at that particular time .
236146:9	Important services have to be
236149:18	National Government , then the time has got to come at so some stage as to whether you defend a principle of Lincolnshire being a de a longer term debt free authority , or whether you look around the county and say , important services must be protected .
236149:133	National Government , then the time has got to come at so some stage as to whether you defend a principle of Lincolnshire being a de a longer term debt free authority , or whether you look around the county and say , important services must be protected .
236160:7	You have to cut you cloth according to the means .
236168:13	Unavoidably , we have to delay some decisions , we put off other decisions , we look at other alternatives , that is the way that you prudently manage budgets .
236234:42	The whole thing , reminds me a little bit of each when I had to get my thousand pounds .
236237:57	Who decided , Mr Chairman , to pay the ten pounds , you were lucky really , you have to pay the two hundred pounds , that 'll be the
236311:39	Selling off the family silver , and look what we 're gonna have to do with that year You have criticised those for setting up the various units , and giving them target for .
236320:12	You 'll have to remember that the that the er increase from last year , it 's an increase , it 's not a cut , not talking about cuts .
236326:40	With a capital investment fund , and yet here you are trying to have to borrow to be able to manage next year .
236359:46	Now Councillor refers to whether the time was right , and why should we have to borrow .
236388:9	did n't have to answer the questions
236394:7	I have to move that under section one hundred A brackets four , the Local Government Act nineteen seventy-two .
236409:29	Er , a knowledge but erm , I would have to move that we cannot accept this recommendation because , it 's not that we do n't er support the scheme within this paper , but it 's that we cannot accept .
236520:30	And I think that a comprehensive consultation exercise has got to bear in mind that the key question , and that 's affordability .
236522:149	We also recognise so to are the workers of County Councils , and District Councils , particularly because the er the government initiatives , one good point to V A T on fuel , and the increasing in in National Insurance Contributions and increases in taxation , so between the two sides has got to be some accommodation , bearing in mind the need for both of us to want to continue to deliver quality services .
236558:122	Erm , and we 've had , I 'm afraid to give protective notice to six members of staff , it 's about er , discussions with the erm , Tech , are not successful , then they will have to leave us at the end of this programme year , which is the thirty-first of March .
236563:34	So there are successes in Horizons Agency , you just have to at the moment by the difficulties in finding the necessary funding to cater for people who are not great achievers in terms of output funding .
236572:26	I do n't , I think we must do , because it underlines it 's it 's as sp , it 's been a slow spiral down for these people , and we 're getting now , very near to the bottom where we 're not going to be able to help any of them at all .
236589:38	When you get down to these groups of people , you have to work with each individual , if you , you 'll know , and find somewhere where you can capitalise on their strengths and hopefully get away with whatever disabilities they had .
236685:74	Erm , because it seems to , with the changing nature of organisation of authorities , it 's used as a comparative purpose , must be er , very doubtful , and we 've always criticised it , er beginning the position snapshot on a particular the day , it does n't say what 's in the pipeline or what 's going out of the pipeline at the other end .
236717:56	cavia I think the Parliament use , that it er , the cost preparing such detailed information must not be disproportionate er to the use it 's going to have , and with that cavia we would welcome further er erm , suggestions as to refinement , and er , I 'm not going to go through this in detail .
236745:29	Erm , and each Chief Officer and each General Manager has to er , look very very closely as to whether we can afford additional staff and er recruit them .
236781:53	Er , I should know that , or certainly agree that all the staff in the Environment must have coped ade adequately well before under the preceding system where each officer , each department was was instructed to deal with the environment as it came along .
236810:48	I appreciate that , but it comes in the same paragraph , so it , you must admit that it 's a little er , confusing .
236834:59	Thank you Chairman , I I can note that remark , but I do think that we do have to defend the position a little on environmental issues .
236858:53	To see that there is a take up of the car contract hire scheme , it constantly has to be held , or kept unde , the scheme has to be kept under review , to make sure that it is attractive and it is what er , the employees want to see , and would prefer rather than an alternate means of transport .
236858:87	To see that there is a take up of the car contract hire scheme , it constantly has to be held , or kept unde , the scheme has to be kept under review , to make sure that it is attractive and it is what er , the employees want to see , and would prefer rather than an alternate means of transport .
236860:47	If it does grow , then there is a certain amount of administration that has to go along with it .
236935:21	Now , the point about merit has to be recognised side by side with opportunities , because the points that I want to say , firstly the the many women and people with disabilities under achieve .
236942:38	It there are two exceptions , that I mentioned , we must give prior consideration in any vacancy that we have for a registered disabled applicant .
236963:13	And this also has got to be encouraged through the schools , so that er , young er you know women , leaving school , going into career , will realise that they will be accepted into a previously male dominated industry .
236969:14	Even that our managers have got to be made by way of
237001:12	But , I must say that , having got that , I do not regard myself as disabled , I have a disability , I do not regard myself as disabled , and it 's this business that you have registered as disabled person , which is a bit of a stigma .
237030:87	We undertook to , you sorry , you authorised us to de-recognise the three unions that were recognised in that field , if the unions agreed , I have to report that two of them have , and the other one naturally , discussions are still going on .
237042:38	I 'm not sure to what extent we in Lincolnshire will have to take the Local Government Staff Commission seriously .
237104:97	therefore we have supported the A C C line on the basis of the flexibility that it would give you , as an employer , bearing in mind , you do n't have to do anything , it will be your choice in the individual case , er , within your policies .
237212:78	Their employee costs are much lower than ours , their social costs are much lower than ours and in and in the real world , we have to compete with them , and the boiling point will come from being competitive , supplying goods and services at a cost that the other countries will not by putting themselves in straight-jackets .
237236:13	Because we must n't miss the point , it does say , it 's er , the government is objecting be on the grounds of health and safety .
237320:54	From here he entered N A L G O and held high office within the Union and many members have to thank for representing them at pay s pay negotiations etcetera .
237362:248	Erm , Local Government and Local Council work is often seen as being very drab and indeed we all know that it 's becoming probably less exciting nowadays with the constraints that there are and what Councils still require er in abundance are characters , people who bring a bit of excitement to Council affairs w i at whatever level and I think that one thing that has is character , sadly missing in so many younger politicians I must say .
237387:13	However , I must tell you , yes I am I do and have been Treasurer of various organisations .
237390:64	My wife and I are very conscious of the very high honour that you have bestowed upon us and I must also thank my Party for proposing , and you all for electing , me to the office of Lord Mayor for the Metropolitan City of .
237397:12	However , I must com comment on the way that since Christmas the Vice Chair of Council has undertaken the many civic duties he has been called upon to perform , assisted by his wife .
237405:53	I know that the new members of Council have been welcomed into our midst and it must be along time since there 've been so many changes .
237409:75	It 's only a few days since I was sitting in the seats you all occupy , realising the difficult job that a Lord Mayor has to undertake in keeping members in order .
237421:58	Whilst the country is still in a continuing and worsening economic depression , and while unemployment rises daily , we must be prepared to meet the challenge , must not miss the opportunities that undoubtedly will come our way .
237421:82	Whilst the country is still in a continuing and worsening economic depression , and while unemployment rises daily , we must be prepared to meet the challenge , must not miss the opportunities that undoubtedly will come our way .
237816:7	It must be the G B H tactics of your parliamentary candidates .
237949:41	and what they did , and you were there , and you must 've been listening , what they did , percent for people , they moved it up to Policy and Resources , Policy and Resources percent for people came around , Councillor spoke .
237970:7	Cities have to have green belts but they should also have green hearts .
237973:29	It 's irr relevance relevance to everyday people must be shown in people 's surroundings , combining the convenience of the new with the conservation of the best of the old .
238440:5	Nor must we let the institution of asylum be undermined by abuse .
238553:76	Indeed , perhaps the most sensible thing that that model of of consistency , Ki Neil Kinnock , has said this year was , law makers must not must not be law breakers .
238553:81	Indeed , perhaps the most sensible thing that that model of of consistency , Ki Neil Kinnock , has said this year was , law makers must not must not be law breakers .
238561:72	At one of our constituency surgeries , a retired widow came in to see us concerning the seventeen pounds extra which she would have to pay extra er to cover the other non-payments .
238563:51	She was told that it was the law to pay the full amount and she must pay it in full , and her answer was that it was the law last year that everyone should pay their own bills , and what happened to them ?
238575:52	If this Council means what it says about devolution and customer er customer contracts , it must begin to see that the over-riding need for local divisional pay determination and sub-divisional pay determination that relates reward to the volume , value and standard of service delivered .
238590:28	Is , my Lord Mayor , going to have to find extra money to fi to to fi to fund those sites independently .
238598:103	What I intend to deal with is the record as it stands because anybody who 's going to argue a case against the decline of of any kind of system has to put the facts as they are , not as they would wish them to be , and I would argue that the legacy , before we can do that , the legacy which we inherited as a controlling group back in 1990 , is now a matter of record I would accept .
238607:23	There are two other documents you have to consider in the monetary and evaluation exercise to see how successful we were in 1990 ninety one , one is called a partnership for quality and the other is called fairer shares , a programme towards an anti strategy .
238793:7	People must be able to get the representation they trust and not that prescribed by the Government , whose in administration you may eventually end up challenging .
238796:10	We rightly have to live in an environment of audits , commissions , Ombudsman and legal review in the course of our conduct .
238817:17	My Lord Mayor , I must confess to being quite surprised by the incredible naivety and complete lack of understanding that 's obviously rampant on the benches opposite with most of the items we 've dealt with today .
238825:64	The Government 's aim is to decide all cases within a matter of months so that all those affected do not have to wait an inordinate length of time to ascertain their legal status in the U K. It 's obvious to everyone not too blind to see that such changes are vital to the mounting pressures on the existing system
238856:5	Nor must we let the institution of asylum be undermined by abuse .
238886:24	The further twenty five pounds that will have to go on the poll tax this year will cost this Council eight point one million .
239035:82	It is the view of many of the vets in the district , the R S P C A Inspectorate and other dog handling professionals , that dogs must have adequate natural exercise and they should be given the opportunity to run freely as frequently as possible .
239062:7	You must speak for not more than five minutes .
239138:71	A policeman who works in the area describes Avenue as a nightmare of a crossing and I and other parents who have to take children across would entirely agree with this .
239186:60	One training organisation , which had taken a twenty three percent cut in funds in 1990 ninety one , had to take a further twenty percent cut this year , and the people who are worst affected by these cuts were the very people that the Tory Party had been crying crocodile tears over for so long .
239213:61	It was by then already obvious that the schools had overcome their first reservations er about what the scheme had to offer and it was so obvious that they deserved recognition for their efforts that it led to my colleagues , Councillor and putting down the motion to Council in April of this year , drawing attention to the continuing success in schools throughout the district of the Local Management initiative .
239271:23	Surely by that time many of you must have realised that had got you into a right pickle over L M S and that you some of you I believe felt that but none of you spoke out about it .
239286:26	on about and I suspect that Councillor must be on about .
239392:7	They had to get rid of a leader before they could bring themselves to admit that the poll tax was a mistake and I ca n't see John Major going before he loses the next election .
239669:34	On the other hand the needs and welfare of the child must be paramount and if a child is deemed to be in danger , or at any particular risk , the child must be removed .
239669:99	On the other hand the needs and welfare of the child must be paramount and if a child is deemed to be in danger , or at any particular risk , the child must be removed .
239671:10	Previously they had to wait twenty eight days before doing so .
239673:52	In the new Act the positive role of relatives and friends is also recognised , but it must be obvious to everyone that some children are just so difficult , often having been very badly abused , and with severe behaviour problems , that they cannot be contained in a family and these children are placed in residential homes .
239677:42	We in the childrens services have known for two years that something more must be done and we must pay our staff more .
239677:57	We in the childrens services have known for two years that something more must be done and we must pay our staff more .
239694:197	Mrs er has er actually said that we should be getting some more money and then she spoilt it by saying we should be using the money we have n't got more er better use it and er maybe knocking the traffic li er islands out will save us a problem cos we 'll get a few kids knocked down and we wo n't have to bother with em .
239710:17	The family who has to care for children whether they 've got disabilities or not and the whole intention of this Act is that children are best cared for by parents and any alternative is second best .
239722:83	And also , when handicapped children are placed in foster homes , the foster parent is assis assessed as a contributor , which of course the Local Authority has to pay .
239761:95	There is concern about funding for the Childrens Act and it 's too important to start scoring political points , whether there 's a general election or not t and I must admit I was off , I was off ill , off work during the week of the Tory Party Conference .
239766:110	They will actually responsibility of Local Government and er we 've tried to put in here something that even Conservative Councillors could support , even though it 's attacking Conservative Ministers , cos they must actually believe in Local Government to actually serve on Local Government , one would think , but er , but th the problems of under-funding are th could be very serious .
239778:79	erm I 've always believed that consistency is an overrated virtue so I 'm not gonna criticise the Conservatives for changing their minds but you have to ask yourself why is this recorded on the agenda today when the sub-committee , planning sub- committee has already met and discussed these matters and things have moved on a little further Well we we really have to look at how the resolution in this paragraph came about in the first place .
239778:193	erm I 've always believed that consistency is an overrated virtue so I 'm not gonna criticise the Conservatives for changing their minds but you have to ask yourself why is this recorded on the agenda today when the sub-committee , planning sub- committee has already met and discussed these matters and things have moved on a little further Well we we really have to look at how the resolution in this paragraph came about in the first place .
239799:67	Is that what this is about , that places can continue to spring up in the private sector and we must close our homes in order to meet that demand not from elderly people for places but from the private sector for profits .
239811:52	If they wish to be assessed as needing residential care and using public money then they have to go through the assessment process and be assessed as needing residential care .
239821:72	That will leave us , presumably at the end of this process with some of the worst homes , which we will then have to decide what to do about .
239823:7	I have to say that our input into what is going on is still very strong .
239847:19	That 's taken out , must be taken out of the calculation because they 're not vacant , you ca n't get anybody in there , the criteria I say , should be beds available for permanent occupation .
239850:91	Now if you any system you got to have beds for short stay etcetera , you do n't count them into whether the those are vacant , because you have to keep some of those vacant in emergencies etcetera so you ca n't count them .
239863:18	Every bed in that difference has to be paid for with wasted money but in addition the loss of income from that bed has to be found from cuts elsewhere in social services .
239863:72	Every bed in that difference has to be paid for with wasted money but in addition the loss of income from that bed has to be found from cuts elsewhere in social services .
239873:7	We must now fear with good reason that it was the first three months which were not typical .
239876:51	I still commend this report to council as the first real stride along the road we have to take , there 's no choice about that .
239881:119	Indeed some of us think we now know what bankers in the republic felt like , if you stand up to make a speech the matter has moved on before you sit down again but I must tell you of the next major problem .
239882:28	Flowing from that that which social service must face urgently and that is this .
239884:149	Next year the full year effect of the revenue budget one point five five million , already two hundred thousand short , the estimated loss of income from reduced placements will now put another eight hundred thousand on that er , so there will be a million next year , so I have to tell you there is a gap of one point three million pounds in the social services budget which we have not yet faced .
239891:32	For the sake of our service and their users we must ensure we are not overrun by those events .
239897:13	Chairman , I must confess to being erm , to being somewhat pessimistic about this whole er this this whole problem of of the need to refurbish and the need to tackle numbers in our elderly persons homes .
239898:38	I I listened to Mr speech with some incredulity I must say , but I did listen to what he said and if what he said is true then I I find some of the things disturbing and and er I 'd like to see his figures and I I w I I that there have certainly been er two messages coming to the social services committee in in in that case .
239905:40	Now if there is no problem why on earth do we have to put that sort of that sort of work by officers erm , in , in to action erm , so between the , if I understand Labour 's position now Chairman , between the twenty fifth of August and the twenty eighth of September , we have now gone from accepting the problem and seeing how we can solve a number problem to saying that there is no no number problem and that everyone is cooking the books .
239946:34	We do know that two or three or four may have to in the foreseeable future .
239953:39	If we have a night sitting service , an elderly person may not have to go in hospital if they are temporarily gone off their legs as sometimes happens .
239961:93	This has never had it so this as far as I 'm concerned really , the only thing that is needs to be made clear , is that we must accept of principle that 's all we need to reason .
239963:57	Er , Professor is right erm there may always be a possibility that at some time er you have to you have to recognise that there may be excess capacity in the system and I I do n't believe that the Labour party is not prepared to recognise that there may well be excess capacity in the system at some time .
239963:66	Er , Professor is right erm there may always be a possibility that at some time er you have to you have to recognise that there may be excess capacity in the system and I I do n't believe that the Labour party is not prepared to recognise that there may well be excess capacity in the system at some time .
239964:73	S what in fact er Mrs said is too early in the process of community care to know how many homes you have to close she really is approaching it from the wrong way , it 's equally too early in the process of community care to know how many homes you need to have open , keep open or open and that is one of the problems which I believe this council and other councils will will face .
239971:7	You must always remember that it 's been a fairly small percentage of the frail elderly people who 've actually ever had to go into homes .
239971:67	You must always remember that it 's been a fairly small percentage of the frail elderly people who 've actually ever had to go into homes .
239975:262	They steer people away from any home which they believe is likely to be closed and once you start doing this , you will in fact be sealing the fate of those homes and you it 's a very , very dangerous game , you 've gotta be , you 've gotta play it very , very carefully indeed and I hope Chairman that there can be a degree of common sense and rationality introduced into discussions between the members of the various groups who have to deal with these very difficult issues .
239989:47	We have the ability to monitor it and I think that the discussions will have to take place as the director brings forward his proposals .
240016:109	It 's alright us starting to go along the road of closures , but some of us have been here through it a lot , little bit longer than others and I think we have got to watch what we 're doing .
240020:98	If these figures are right that we 've been given by the department and I 'm not saying them whether they 're right or whether they 're wrong but well we have to r rely on what we 're getting this is why Mr is sending this lot to the Chief Executive for him to do some work I think it 's very important that it is done independently , not by the independent sector but by done independently .
240034:35	I think that 's right so , we we must n't even start even thinking about closing beds at the moment .
240046:10	Now we must keep we must keep be I know people and I 'm sure every member in this council chamber knows people that need respite care .
240046:21	Now we must keep we must keep be I know people and I 'm sure every member in this council chamber knows people that need respite care .
240062:74	Yes , thank you Chair , erm A lot of this debate circles around what we do about community care , I have to tell this council as far as I 'm concerned , community care 's dead in the water .
240083:62	But the real fact is if this council regards elderly persons homes as the priority it pretends then it has to be the first priority for that money .
240084:12	It does n't have to stand in line behind anything else .
240099:13	People really do have to understand the trauma we are talking about with moving people out of homes , the trauma that moving them out for refurbishment is bad enough .
240101:14	We really do have to put a human face onto these figures and these financial arguments , until we do that , we will not carry any decision in this council chamber which is worth a light to any single elderly person in any of our homes or outside of our homes Chairman .
240163:50	But even without the figures it takes very little imagination to see why this council must not put off any longer the construction and commissioning of the southern fire station .
240200:20	It has impressed but it has to have the right tools if it is going to provide the safety that councillor referred to and the saving of life which was referred to by councillor .
240206:15	I think we must make it a positive step forward that this council not only goes forwards to build but it goes forward to use that building and give the firemen of this county the right tools , or firewoman , the firemen and the firewoman of this county the right tools to work with .
240217:98	Now er there are some areas based in my area where you would n't get the fire station , the fire engine through the bottleneck in ten minutes erm , all this has got to be put in its relative priority .
240252:73	We have re , technically reached the end of the debate I 'm very sorry Mr I 'm sorry you 'll have to wave a little I 'm very sorry er , those in favour of the ame amendment .
240293:7	We must think Jim of those people as I said that we are responsible for .
240302:205	Mr Chairman er when we discussed this last time er I expressed the view that in fact er the county council had better things to do I 've not changed my mind erm since but I have been reminded that er when er the Roman Emperors er found ascension in the ranks when Roman Emperors found ascension in the ranks they provided bread and circuses and I have to say that I regard the two notices of motion which were placed in Mr notably fox hunting and this debate on V A T as bread and circuses .
240319:32	of reduction of er emissions then in fact you have got to reduce the consumption of erm hydrocarbons er as interesting as the Liberal party has said for years but now er pretends it had nothing to do with erm , er V A T on fuel .
240334:7	I must remind you that in Europe that marvellous place with the social contract , has n't prevented everyone paying tax on on fuel .
240339:17	The Liberals said it must be done and done quickly the Liberals said it must be done and done quickly , get extra tax on the fossil fuels for the sake of the environment .
240339:48	The Liberals said it must be done and done quickly the Liberals said it must be done and done quickly , get extra tax on the fossil fuels for the sake of the environment .
240342:258	And I 'm sure you 've had a bit of thought about it , I 'm glad you 're see it there er and the whole lot is a blessed mismatch , it 's nothing to do with us though I do thank you Mr for the help you wish to give me , the Duke of Westminster and the Duke of Rutland if this goes through as I said this today because without a doubt the government will listen to what you have to say and I 've no doubt it will be effect .
240347:79	Er , I wondered about this erm this Tory high flyer , about whom er , my friend over there speaks with such admiration and envy , he must have a tremendous influence because I wonder , had he been the mover behind the fact that this V A T on fuel is is there in every other country in Europe including Ireland where it 's about eleven percent .
240348:15	So this Tory high flyer must be a very high flyer indeed .
240368:168	I think , well , clearly those people those people who have er those who have some notion of decency and particularly even taking into account the mixed economy that we need to work in will support er the notion that those people who cannot burden this kind of tax should not have to er er should not have to partake .
240368:185	I think , well , clearly those people those people who have er those who have some notion of decency and particularly even taking into account the mixed economy that we need to work in will support er the notion that those people who cannot burden this kind of tax should not have to er er should not have to partake .
240391:75	We maybe on different sides , but we want to make sure that the O A P s and the people that do have to er er present th pay these bills , I mean if you consider if you think of Calor , Calor Gas , Calor Gas , the way that I actually heat my I pay V A T on that , Calor Gas is is is V A T ed
240450:12	Finally , I have to report that sales in France have increased by thirty per cent with like for like performance of six per cent on the same period last year .
240478:67	well the reason that we 've changed the name on those two stores is that any experiments we want to conduct have got to be conducted outside the normal M F I promotional platform and as we use the national press extensively the only way to do that is to change the name .
240483:9	Do they have to be a lot bigger these stores
240567:17	All work on display must be British of origin .
240568:35	We appreciate that raw materials may be foreign but it must not exceed thirty five percent of the finished product .
240570:16	Work outside these limits must be removed .
240571:17	And they say you have to send in some of your product and then they come round to your stand and if it does n't comply they just take it off your stand which is our whole merchandise really .
240582:86	we have had a letter back and it 's exactly the same as I got when I rang them up , if they just say it must not exceed a certain amount and they wo n't be tied down to tell me .
240590:19	Yes and yeah we 'll have to give you that copy .
240611:60	It 's er er somebody on business is visiting and they the wife has come and she has to entertain the wife .
240613:13	So er that has to just wait now until the next meeting .
240637:20	It 's not er you have to push for it now .
240781:145	Then we 're sending a letter which erm , well let me just say , we are then also sending , now here with the D I Y , the numbers er coincide Here the numbers coincide with the illustrations , so if I talk about a certain you have to look at paper one , paper two paper three or A B C. And you see what they look like .
240806:49	Now there is another way of advertising and with Harrogate not coming off , I must say I 'm quite keen on this .
240842:24	Bridal Fairs I go to , we have to pay either a fee for going or put an advert in .
240852:33	But it is a lot of advertising but then we have to generate the business somehow .
240902:15	I think you have to appreciate here that what we are doing is mainly therapy .
240903:9	And we must make it pay as much as we can .
240904:12	But and we must really work on it , but we will have our limits , due to the slowness of people , due to the wastage .
240907:15	And we will always have to be helped .
240965:13	that any advertising must be funded independently .
240982:10	I 'll have to
240993:53	We have n't got the cash to do that so therefore I think the criteria must be , have we got funding before we embark on advertising .
240996:7	We have to get somebody who will pay us this .
240999:17	But then you you also have to evaluate what what your priorities are because you can only go to so many people for funding ca n't you .
241023:59	I mean eventually eventually , sooner or later and it might be later if somebody else will still it has to come out of the profit margin .
241025:94	The business is out there , we are set up to do it , and I 've worked it out and and Zain and Ian and I of course we have to go through it , that eventually we will be able to meet it .
241058:16	I think decision has to be made after er consideration and and of a few people putting heads together .
241075:9	But we have to see .
241078:34	So even if other people pay for it , we will have to be pretty convinced that it will be successful .
241109:20	It 's costly but we have to do that as well .
241117:68	But all I can say is we people who see us I mean it 's not as if everybody has to have favours with their wedding , it 's still a fairly new thing .
241181:150	And and I 'm all in favour as I say getting more through the letter box , it 's easier for us and it But I I think I mean I 'm quite happy to leave this now and just carry on with the bridal But we have to make this pay itself
241185:26	Because that 's the whole object , they have to come .
241186:45	They 're churning out crackers and they 're churning them out and they have to be sold .
241187:59	And at the end of the year , today in a year , we will sit here and we have to have sold it .
241188:9	And we have to get into that market , we ca n't afford too much to to hang back .
241192:44	They read them and yes they send away to several and then you have to score , you have to have something better than somebody else .
241192:61	They read them and yes they send away to several and then you have to score , you have to have something better than somebody else .
241219:18	At the moment I 've had to er shall we say adjust certain figures , because in fact er I have n't got the details .
241225:15	Yeah well that 'll have to be adjusted
241229:13	Well it would have to be very strictly adhered to then next year .
241258:7	We have to come back to that in a minute okay .
241291:40	It 's very hard work for her er you know she has to sort of get a get all the systems She has to you know it 's it 's very hard work to get the systems going .
241291:75	It 's very hard work for her er you know she has to sort of get a get all the systems She has to you know it 's it 's very hard work to get the systems going .
241305:103	And I mean this is what self employed people do , you know they go and they get taught there and then that 's it and then they the rest they have to teach themselves .
241318:45	So please will you consider for three months out of our funds which has to be the to pay her that amount of money or else we cannot cope .
241320:23	Nobody is there who can She has to do it .
241321:12	But she also has to learn it .
241323:41	I was gonna ask is you know that he ha she has to do all these long hours .
241331:80	I mean we 've tried to write down everything she does but it 's so varied I mean , telephone calls and she has to do telephone calls .
241343:10	We will have to see .
241344:20	See at the moment she has to learn about TAS you know .
241345:7	She had to learn about accountancy ,
241347:10	now she has to learn about stock control .
241356:48	But er I think we ca n't nobody else can do it and it has to be done .
241367:18	You know er it has to come really out of the Christmas Fair or Sir ' s donations , something unallocated .
241369:11	And then we have to review it again and er
241399:88	And erm somebody like Mike of Chris is perfectly capable of get their bits of paper to check to tick off things like that but Wendy will have to check it and put it you know they could do some of the legwork but not yet .
241401:7	It has to be ready for that okay ?
241413:32	That 's normal and that 's what Wendy has to learn to do or else it 's you know it 's it 's difficult for somebody else to if Ian did it he would have to get all the figures first .
241413:123	That 's normal and that 's what Wendy has to learn to do or else it 's you know it 's it 's difficult for somebody else to if Ian did it he would have to get all the figures first .
241439:14	Yes and the committee has to learn to adjust themselves to that to that to not worry
241511:27	Actually that 's something you 're gonna have to watch is n't it ?
241547:66	And then but then at the end er you know I think you said , Oh but Emmy says it all has to put together .
241600:19	Can I please because I have to be off in a few minutes .
241609:7	I have to be off so soon , come on what now .
241615:36	There is a set formula to do it and she has to learn it .
241617:9	And she has to learn how to do it .
241653:103	That admin course is fantastic , a re er you know I was in this r building yesterday , and I can tell you , the attendance is good I mean they have to have a real reason before they do n't come .
241698:44	Which er can I possibly carry on from there and if you we have to talk about .
241706:81	And I would like to buy two chairs for the favour room , you know chairs to sit on cos at the moment we have to always go and get them from the er cracker room .
241722:127	And and also I mean I do n't want a zigzag and I really recommend we get somebody for Well I do n't want to Tom to cut the sides like that with scissors you know , it has to be neat .
241755:22	And I take it it would have to be infrared .
241756:10	You 'd have to have a sensor going down the corridor and one in the back because they 'd come in the back , they would n't come through the
241761:64	Everybody who had a key I mean if there was a number to or something to do they have to know .
241789:7	It has to be connected with the front door key .
241802:11	And you must n't have outside bells , must n't have outside bells here because you 'd you 'd get so much opposition from those people
241802:26	And you must n't have outside bells , must n't have outside bells here because you 'd you 'd get so much opposition from those people
241814:13	You 'll just have to get them to give you a quote .
241830:18	Well I mean you have to get them it 's it 's the little money you would get for those you 'd have a job finding
241857:59	Er can you Well hopefully in the minutes I need to can somebody make a note , we have to fund raise for that .
241860:10	And we have to do that , we must get tables .
241860:28	And we have to do that , we must get tables .
241861:7	Rowntrees must have hundreds of tables .
241877:52	It 's very tight to get in what we need to get in and we have to buy just the right tables .
241883:36	No no but Celia , Ruby Ruby told me her husband has to do with bankrupt office stock
241889:34	Well we 're just I 'm just we might have to ask for some money for it .
241900:8	We must make a list but
241903:94	that this will happen , people will come to us occasionally and say , do you need money for what specific and I think , as a committee we must have a future , a list for the future of things we might want and also of ideas we have .
241905:21	Do you know , but you have to be so quick and you have to be precise and you must know that that 's what you want .
241905:45	Do you know , but you have to be so quick and you have to be precise and you must know that that 's what you want .
241905:64	Do you know , but you have to be so quick and you have to be precise and you must know that that 's what you want .
241922:10	Yeah we have to we shall do that quite soon I think .
241938:38	So I 'll try again but I think you 're gonna have to telephone Erm not telephone , write to Mr directly .
241946:35	Ah ah it was but it was sanctioned but we had to sign a contract with them .
241971:10	We 'd have to have another one
241985:33	No it 's it works every two weeks , I have to check it does n't fall into that
241994:78	I 'm telling you we work hard , I know we can get better organized , but we do work very hard and we have to work on so many fronts .
242005:10	Well I have to dash
242468:10	I I must confess Mr I had some difficulty with the wording of P P G there when it says , unacceptable coalescence , er and trying to balance that against the expressed aim that this should be freestanding .
242502:14	Erm and I have to say that er I mean if if if for example this was to Well assuming we had H two policy then would n't you expect to make some cross-reference here to your ei policy M eight in your approved structure plan ?
242528:23	And this is a matter which must be given some weight in decision when you combine it with the other factors also which we have gone through today .
242541:23	Or is it something which just has to be considered as part of the planning process ?
242589:31	That I think is a factor which you must give importance to given the views of the Secretary of State .
242649:55	With particular regard to the interests of our client , other than taking an overview , we obviously have to look specifically at the southwest sector as a as a possible location .
242655:15	I mean we have to make a sensible planning decision on where it should go and the fact that one authority is prepared to put its hand up when the others clearly are n't , should not be the main determining factor .
242666:71	If if you as a panel conclude that the information erm is inadequate , clearly er on that basis then then a suggestion would have to be made as to one how this matter can be progressed .
242775:72	He may for instance need to intervene at the modification stage of the structure plan , or it could be that he will have to deal with appeals against non-determination of applications made by prospective developers .
242813:19	Er and I again I have to say that we have not come to any conclusions about the new settlement , but certainly if there is to be a new settlement , then generally people would like more certainty .
242844:29	I think the second element is that there must be some sense of a concentrational identity erm so that the the sporadic development that one does tend to see in the countryside , I do n't believe constitutes a settlement .
242849:44	Trying to bring those those elements together into a single definition , I I had to use an established grouping of permanent habitation .
242897:9	So it must fall within the remain you know eight districts figures .
242934:9	Then we have to revamp .
242935:7	We have to recognize the situation but erm restructure accordingly .
242956:136	Erm before we actually get down discussing this er submission can I just say that we do have another issue to talk about at er two o' clock this afternoon and therefore it means that our discussion will , on this topic , will have to terminate at one o' clock .
242961:14	Er I also have to reemphasize again that we have in no way we have made up our minds as to whether or not there should be a new settlement , but we have to proceed to discuss the issues as identified .
242961:103	Er I also have to reemphasize again that we have in no way we have made up our minds as to whether or not there should be a new settlement , but we have to proceed to discuss the issues as identified .
242966:14	Cos that I must say that was the way in which we would have wished to have proceeded with the discussion .
242967:13	We we do have to try to answer this question of whether or not there should be specific guidance about the location .
243024:14	I I I have to say that I I I I 'm not enthusiastic about using this which is so obviously at a report in support of the particular locations , to to look objectively at the criteria .
243037:130	Whether we should include as a consideration whether this particular eighth new settlement in this particular sector would have the capacity to expand beyond two thousand and si In saying that I 'm conscious that we have ducked because as a panel we have to duck .
243081:13	Er I I have to deal with I I say we must er Mr has put this in as number two on his list , which is local planning authority support .
243081:41	Er I I have to deal with I I say we must er Mr has put this in as number two on his list , which is local planning authority support .
243084:9	And that must be the underlying , one of the underlying themes i i in considering er this this in considering this review of the area around York .
243131:51	On the ground the the division between the B one three six three corridor and A sixty four north must be erm a difficult one but again I for convenience I have used the district boundary to divide the two .
243153:85	You say the area astride the B thirteen sixty three broadly between the boundary of Hambledon district to the west and to the east , so it must be Ryedale ,
243169:10	Well I must confess Mr it 's it 's difficult if we get into a situation where we 've got an area straddling two districts and I do n't have to say why , in some respects .
243169:95	Well I must confess Mr it 's it 's difficult if we get into a situation where we 've got an area straddling two districts and I do n't have to say why , in some respects .
243239:25	Does it mean that county and district have got to sign up for it ?
243250:36	And therefore whilst it may be that district councils will have to take some reservations , in expressing support .
243255:13	But I I must say it fills me with trepidation .
243276:17	In that obviously they have to take on board the views of their constituent districts .
243277:32	And three or four of them like this , they have to try and come up with the the right solution .
243280:38	The Secretary of State , I 'm sure would would obviously have to take on board what was embodied in the final structure plan .
243282:45	And i it may be , for instance , erm that he may even have to intervene at the modification stage if something was going seriously wrong .
243474:10	We 'll have to give you a new name .
243520:70	And I think probably erm there is another issue which is equally important and that is the question that it must be a location where people who develop employment wish to locate and erm and develop enterprises .
243601:30	I 'm sorry Mr , I think we have to press you on this , can I can I take it from what you have said We have to press you because for the reasons we explained on Friday morning , we have to go through the sector sites , if only to find at the end it cannot be done .
243601:91	I 'm sorry Mr , I think we have to press you on this , can I can I take it from what you have said We have to press you because for the reasons we explained on Friday morning , we have to go through the sector sites , if only to find at the end it cannot be done .
243601:136	I 'm sorry Mr , I think we have to press you on this , can I can I take it from what you have said We have to press you because for the reasons we explained on Friday morning , we have to go through the sector sites , if only to find at the end it cannot be done .
243610:134	Now whilst I might concur with that view if it was er well related to the A sixty four , in fact immediately adjacent to the A sixty four , I think given the criteria you 've got that the new settlement clearly has to avoid the greenbelt , I think that actually any of the locations being ten miles s sorry six to ten miles outside of the York urban area , would play little role in meeting the strategic employment needs of the urban area .
243706:10	I I have to
243707:112	I I know that you 're going you that that that you may suggest that er my view it 's not capable of being assimilated but I think the the the basic view I have to put forward to you is that it is not necessary .
243740:29	I mean it was a report it must have been to the member authorities , was it a progress report or deliberations ?
243768:40	New roads that would need to be provided would therefore have to come from that direction and and it itself will cut a swathe through the open countryside .
243797:102	And ma ' am on a further point which I think is very significant when you 're dealing with proposals in the A sixty four south of York , is you have to take into account not only the impact of the new settlement itself , but the impact of associated infrastructure .
243798:83	And of course what Mr does not refer to in any of his submissions n is the need for new settlements in that area to be have to have very long access roads .
243888:83	The impact of that on Leeds residents perception of the migration opportunities is quite different quite different from a new settlement on a very accessible corridor which would have to be promoted and would have to be built quickly to be to present itself as a successful venture .
243888:102	The impact of that on Leeds residents perception of the migration opportunities is quite different quite different from a new settlement on a very accessible corridor which would have to be promoted and would have to be built quickly to be to present itself as a successful venture .
243908:22	And including in that travel time , must be the congestion which they will face as they approach Leeds which which already is er a difficult problem .
243956:71	But we did did take the opportunity over the weekend to actually run our traffic model er at a very crude level , I have to estimate .
243965:24	The difference between them is I have to admit at this level , relatively marginal in terms of er which is the worst and which is the best between the three .
243966:108	But our conclusion is that in fact the south east sector is the er least harmful of the three , but the south west sector is the next least harmful and that in fact , somewhat surprisingly I must admit , that the north east sector is actually the worst of those three .
243972:139	Erm I think it 's important to recognize in rail terms that erm the east coast main line , erm particularly obviously er the section heading north , British Rail would not allow er a new station opening on the east coast main line , so you have to confine yourselves to looking at those which have a a regional railway route .
244047:24	It is I think I must emphasise , Mr refers in his evidence to the fact that there there is an existing station along this radial route .
244085:7	I must say that the way the discussion has gone this morning , is n I would say , slightly disappointing because there is some attempt to make a positive contribution , but at the moment it 's not necessarily pointing us quite in the direction which we would hope to go .
244093:12	Er and I have to remind you that the panel has to be concerned primarily with the need .
244093:34	Er and I have to remind you that the panel has to be concerned primarily with the need .
244269:18	I 'm sorry I have to ask you to say who you are before you speak .
244345:17	No right well we 'll have to go up and have a look at them .
244356:133	But there 's a lot if we were going to talk about the m relative merits of the inner and outer today , I think er there 's quite a lot in addition to the er the traffic effects within Knaresborough which we would have to go into er er because I mean , in fact we 've and that is why I did n't include in certainly in my statement , er any defence er in any great detail of choosing an outer route as opposed to an inner route .
244405:149	Well it was to be helpful to the er to Mr and Scotton Parish Council that what what I was saying was , we were n't relying on the key diagram to justify at some future date , it being an outer northern relief road , that decision would have to be defended at future enquiry .
244455:7	They have got to the stage having gone through the consultation , having done the assessments , looked at the alternatives , have declared that as their preferred route which er the next stage would then be as I say , the planning process .
244458:19	Er it may indeed deed have to change to change its mind if if a future planning enquiry er
244663:26	I find it I find I must say I find it difficult to understand why you find it difficult to understand that they they chose that particular route .
244688:35	One of the erm I mean I think it has to be said that we erm I support everything that er Chris has said about the the effect of traffic relief .
244694:40	But I think erm the general point that was made really has to be considered alongside other considerations , is is the the key consideration .
244785:7	I must choose my words with care as well that my clients and I think that there was very much an effect of people wanting to have a relief road , but also wanting to have it as far away from themselves a as they could have it .
244800:17	in the information so we had to we had to assume one for the purpose of public consultation but we said that the final decision on standards would be taken er in another time .
244800:28	in the information so we had to we had to assume one for the purpose of public consultation but we said that the final decision on standards would be taken er in another time .
244802:28	Clearly when we make a planning application we have to er finalize that .
244897:21	I think the pr if there has to be a primary purpose it is a actually to take out the traffic which does n't belong in Harrogate
244919:96	Er particular there is er a commercial business area at Harlow c court er located on the the western fringe er which clearly at the moment , a lot of our traffic will have to use Road to get into Harrogate and to access to the A sixty one .
244920:77	Now a significant part of that traffic will in the future or with such a road , er make use of that and would no longer have to use Road .
244964:96	And is it not therefore necessary if you 're going to justify this western relief road and quote your own words , as a key link to the north , that will there have to do further work in order to make that road acceptable .
245028:167	In fact erm we have clearly in terms of the of the southern bypass is in place er and and also the A one , er there are two other schemes we do have in place so in terms of doing travel times and seeing er which is the quickest route we have to to some extent er Well we rely upon the traffic model .
245092:22	If I have , e I have to say that I do n't think that the particular version of the inner northern route had its junction with the southern bypass moved to the west .
245131:18	That we that we have to look at these at this stage of the scheme .
245150:50	Valley , Beck , Crag and right next to in fact in this particular line , I have to say this , next to Gardens which is a both an international and national recognized er facility in this er in our envir in our town which attracts many many visitors .
245175:69	I 'm not I do n't necessarily want to dispute them erm all I would say is that we have to look at the implications do n't just look at the change in the traffic flows and take them as a as a point , you have to look at the implications of those changes in traffic flows .
245175:147	I 'm not I do n't necessarily want to dispute them erm all I would say is that we have to look at the implications do n't just look at the change in the traffic flows and take them as a as a point , you have to look at the implications of those changes in traffic flows .
245185:58	It 's very difficult to quantify those sorts of effects and er to members and the decision makers have to come to a judgement as best they can , given the information that 's before them .
245271:32	Secondly it says that for pedestrian severance , that changes have to be of the degree of thirty percent before they become s significant .
245319:9	And I have to say that cos Mr ca n't answer that , that is how the western community of Harrogate felt when they saw the way that this public consultation document was led .
245332:12	Erm it has to be said that er new roads do o open up opportunities for development .
245333:51	We erm we 've been discussing all last week the amount of housing that has to be accommodated in Harrogate District and in North Yorkshire as as a whole .
245334:10	We will have to find erm sites for that new housing .
245335:29	If a new road is propo proposed we have to look at the opportunities provided by that ro road .
245341:89	The western route if provided along that corridor would help in that situation and would mean that er other sites which are perhaps open countryside , do n't have to be developed .
245382:16	We also yes I must remind you that we have read the papers so I do n't necessarily want to go through it word by word line by line er but obviously when you want to make a point you will refer back to those papers but do n't you must assume that we have read them and that everybody else has read them .
245382:160	We also yes I must remind you that we have read the papers so I do n't necessarily want to go through it word by word line by line er but obviously when you want to make a point you will refer back to those papers but do n't you must assume that we have read them and that everybody else has read them .
245438:7	We have to make decisions , that 's what planning is about coming to decisions .
245448:51	We are n't prevented from having the debate and indeed in having that debate Hambleton will have to prove they 've made drawn the right boundaries .
245449:25	We would n't they would n't be have to deal with that it was simply having a poli a blanket policy .
245456:30	The difference is , of course , that those policies have got to be tested if each individual case appropriateness and er I I do feel that if we have a blanket policy then we wo n't be able to test it .
245457:10	You then have to ask yourself the question , If there is n't any Government , if there is n't any er local development pressure of any substance which has brought about the need for this policy , has there been some sort of quantum change in Government policy which has necessitated that we give emphasis to this particular issue .
245462:48	If that were the case then I would say to you that there must be some exceptions to it and the one exception I am particularly concerned with , and it 's up to others to bring forward their particular exceptions , is that of rural affordable housing .
245466:79	So I would say to you as part of this opening submission that there is no need for this policy , it is various , there must be a safe plan for rural affordable housing .
245531:9	And somebody has to say that under Section fifty four A if this kind of policy exists in the county structure plan it will be extremely difficult for any proposer erm of development outside built-up areas , existing built-up areas , to proceed .
245592:33	And I have pointed out in my papers that you must bear in mind perhaps that er quite a number of Rich er quite a number of the districts in North Yorkshire are of county scale in their sheer size and that therefore it is not inappropriate that at that level that the policies would be refined .
245610:11	Erm and I have to er pick up the point made opposite that the protection has been pretty good over the last few years without the policy .
245612:89	But there is nothing anywhere in the P P G twelve in particular which says that before a district can have policy in their local plan there must be a lead policy in the structure plan .
245628:102	And I also rely on my evidence of of quoting another custodian of Government policy namely the Prime Minister and its current Prime Minister erm who makes the point that proposals for development must not be turned down simply because it is the safest course .
245672:117	And it seems to me that this Policy E two is not in line with with strategic guidance and if you 're not if you 're having that are there some special circumstances that mean that you have to explain particularly what it is that you you have to do .
245672:151	And it seems to me that this Policy E two is not in line with with strategic guidance and if you 're not if you 're having that are there some special circumstances that mean that you have to explain particularly what it is that you you have to do .
245695:121	I think one of the main reasons why we would support the inclusion of a Policy erm E two in the structure plan is because North Yorkshire is adamantly a very rural area and therefore whatever happened in that rural area must be a strategic issue .
245764:168	Now this phrase strictly controlled erm I I I wanted to ask it myself because I you know trying to push it through to what it actually means I think the county council if you like has taken it at what may be face value and said well strictly controlled must mean something .
245765:7	It must mean that there is a er an approach that says that development in the open countryside is n't normally permissible erm unless unless unless .
245774:19	Er Chairman I I really have to say I do n't I do n't really agree with the assertion that the policy is is essentially more restrictive than than er P P G seven will indicate and I would endorse what er Patrick Earle has said in in that regard .
245855:8	We have to trust the districts can trust the county the county can trust the districts and that in practice they would make this work at local plan level .
245878:108	And if you take into account that the words , A general presumption against , were common phraseology in policies in the nineteen eighties and we now use the er play against presumption we now have to use the phrase , Will not normally be permitted .
245881:31	And so it seems to me that what has got to be proven , and I come back to the point , is that something has changed and we have n't heard anything that has changed er in in that time .
245890:50	But nothing has has really changed it 's surely implicit that green field sites will have to be released to meet the justifiable needs for development erm that there are ways clearly to minimize the impact by by first redeveloping the existing sites by by releasing sites in less sensitive locations , or developing sites that have minimal impact on on existing settle settlements or patterns of development un unless in exceptional circumstances there is for example the need for a new settlement .
245908:59	Erm it 's obviously right and proper that a local planning authority if it 's releasing green field sites has to justify why those sites should be released .
245916:18	And that sort of application has to be considered in the context of countryside protection policies .
245917:16	The need for development has to be established and so erm I refute the fact totally that there has n't been pressure for development in the countryside , that 's certainly not the case .
245931:39	I I if it can be done in the greenbelt policy it must be done in E two and there can be no argument that it is not too detailed a matter in greenbelt policy but too detailed a matter in E two .
245938:7	There has to be a strategic theme particularly in counties such as North Yorkshire which is predominantly rural , it is a major area of planning control , fully merits strategic control and that strategic control must be applied or if it if it is to be applied in the structure plan if you do agree that there should be a Policy E two , then the control of development must be applied consistently over the districts .
245938:109	There has to be a strategic theme particularly in counties such as North Yorkshire which is predominantly rural , it is a major area of planning control , fully merits strategic control and that strategic control must be applied or if it if it is to be applied in the structure plan if you do agree that there should be a Policy E two , then the control of development must be applied consistently over the districts .

246023:37	I mean it if it applies then the local development plan has to be followed unless material considerations indicate otherwise and among the material considerations explicitly by Government policy is the existence of a local needs housing requirement .
246025:31	But I mean the the panel is going to have to explore this apparent conflict which I do n't think 's been properly papered over between what is in paragraph five of P P G one and section fifty four A. Er it 's a nice dilemma which we 're we 're faced the planning profession as a whole is faced with erm and and I think that either it 's section fifty four A or it 's paragraph five of P P , P P G one .
246080:191	Erm the the particular case of Richmondshire having been referred to I I felt I ought to point that er we 're quite content with the concept of Policy E two as giving the strategic weight to the question of protecting the open countryside and the balance , the very difficult balance , decisions that we and other authorities are going to have to come to in preparing our local plan .
246081:33	We 're quite content that we 're going to have to er put before the local plan system the the countervailing issues and the weight that 's given to the countryside through E two is appropriate in the circumstances .
246335:9	So I had to take it from the telesales side to get the appointment to get in the door to do a demonstration and then to do the after sales .
246355:7	You had to bring someone into the business and they brought someone into the business and that was their form of selling .
246402:18	Oh I thought I had to get the estate agent first and then get the space .
246571:10	I I have to say that we we I I we just we just see that we point out to people it 's an even bigger po position of trust .
246583:18	But I do n't I have to keep in touch of course with all companies how we 're doing .
246597:13	There there I have to say there 'd be very few .
246600:9	No you must not do that yourself .
246617:7	We have to get off after three weeks .
246659:12	What we have to decide here is that you think is a is a
246710:23	They might extend it if we have to do both .
246732:4	have got to be ready for the season starting ?
246768:10	You just have to look round a lot of trophy cabinets and you can see a lot of locally sponsored cups and trophies in there .
247011:9	So you have to tell people all about .
247058:36	Those are covered by a special arrangement where we do n't have to collect a cheque we do n't have a banker 's order but it 's done through a erm a company invoice
247061:44	The difference there is instead of the cheque and the banker 's order you have to pick up an official order from the BUPA hospital .
247079:14	Right because I have to put that on my notes you see and I
247093:7	They have got to respond to it .
247207:10	I 'll have to go and get a pen .
247247:14	Ta sorry I had to drag you out here on this weather .
247305:34	It 's alw always very useful that er erm if we have to people have to ask us to wait around for them for five or six weeks or sometimes on a three monthly er er resignation thing it er
247305:43	It 's alw always very useful that er erm if we have to people have to ask us to wait around for them for five or six weeks or sometimes on a three monthly er er resignation thing it er
247348:10	You still have to get good people in their fifties .
247377:112	But erm because I 've been out there doing this and that 's that was part of my if you like to come in to do the recruitment side of it , er I had to experience and I 'm glad I did because there were one or two pre-judgements I had about advertising sales , as most people do , erm that I had to get wiped out of my erm my my system .
247440:28	Here 's something that he by law has got to have .
247451:18	They could they 'd have to keep cut back .
247530:11	Well you must have heard enough on the phone erm and there and there 's no bull which I gave you
247542:9	And I have to say that we give our commitment very quickly and we would like to think that people also give erm their commitment .
247577:7	There must be plenty of work out there I always think .
247597:27	Now I that 's a luxury I have to say that most recruiting people do not get .
247599:34	Er having said that er some of the newer opportunities must have er a lot of oh catching up to do if you like er to to the levels of the estate agents and to a lesser extent the doctors surgeries .
247604:31	we 're well into erm I suppose we must be approaching somewhere in the region of two thousand surgeries out of fifteen thousand that are available to us .
247632:15	Erm you just have to hope you can pass it on to er er the next assignment you 're doing .
247709:26	And that is a figure you just have to have fixed in your mind all right ?
247739:73	Unlike traditional sales where you wait until you get round there to tell them what the price is you have you have to er tell them what er the price on the phone .
247746:58	Erm do n't s you know if you 're not a discount man forget that you you just have to say I 'm I 'm gonna use it if I need it .
247749:20	Now that 's that I have to say is achievable in two weeks just the same .
247757:19	It 's you do n't have to sell a lot if er you 've got a couple of full pages and a couple halves .
247764:52	One of the things I I I found it very difficult to start with I must admit is that to to prejudge that people would or would not go in .
247765:142	Now if I point out that it 's in bold erm and it preempts a question that generally comes up and that is if we er we will pay thirty percent up to a hundred miles one way away from home and er if we had to send you , and it 's a big if I have to say it 's a big if in especially in the medical practice side , if we had to send you more than a hundred miles we will pay another five percent .
247765:178	Now if I point out that it 's in bold erm and it preempts a question that generally comes up and that is if we er we will pay thirty percent up to a hundred miles one way away from home and er if we had to send you , and it 's a big if I have to say it 's a big if in especially in the medical practice side , if we had to send you more than a hundred miles we will pay another five percent .
247765:233	Now if I point out that it 's in bold erm and it preempts a question that generally comes up and that is if we er we will pay thirty percent up to a hundred miles one way away from home and er if we had to send you , and it 's a big if I have to say it 's a big if in especially in the medical practice side , if we had to send you more than a hundred miles we will pay another five percent .
247773:8	I have to say I did my assignments I went there and back I did n't I did n't mess around with staying away .
247787:9	And I have to say that this is the minimum I 've ever seen for a sales person to have to do .
247787:61	And I have to say that this is the minimum I 've ever seen for a sales person to have to do .
247788:9	But it has to be absolutely right .
247790:72	It 's critical to get it right because there are situations where if you do n't get it right then they have to hold some commission back and that 's a pity .
247813:23	But the other thing that you have to er be erm very clear about is er on on the monetary side is if there are two signatories to the cheque , right ? both of them need to have signed it .
247814:26	But the other important is that they both have to sign the banker 's order .
247848:14	So they do n't have to go to an advertising agency or a graphics designer to have it all drawn up we 'll do that for them .
247852:61	And those are the three things get that right plus a compliment slip and a letter heading , because if we have to lift a logo if that if we had to lift that off er you know photocopy wo n't er photocopy wo n't do , so we we take a compliment slip or letter heading .
247852:91	And those are the three things get that right plus a compliment slip and a letter heading , because if we have to lift a logo if that if we had to lift that off er you know photocopy wo n't er photocopy wo n't do , so we we take a compliment slip or letter heading .
247936:10	Well you have to do it .
247937:36	You you see the important thing is that that contract has to be done in front of the and so does the copy , so does the cheque so they 're all done on the spot .
247942:11	You may have to wait for one or two things but you know like like copy sometimes but I did n't used to send them s erm er contracts in unless they had everything .
247952:13	Er you one must be reminded that er it 's only three weeks today from when I was made redundant
247969:133	I it 's it 's a pity to be talked out of out of what we 've got but er it it it 's a case , sorry I say talked out of it it 's discussions and erm you have to say that most er ladies look at saying well now what can you promise me every week
247988:12	You do n't have to do n't have to procure my own leads .
247988:24	You do n't have to do n't have to procure my own leads .
247990:13	All you have to do provide is your own car .
248037:29	We 've just changed some of the had to have some of my little notes down there .
248069:14	Now if we have to send you out fur you know er with a trainer or top person who where you need to stay away we will pay .
248071:56	Erm we will pay bed breakfast and evening meal up to thirty pound a night and I have to say the trainers will always know of some good deals .
248074:48	That was only if on that Thur on that Mon Thursday and Friday if you have to stay away on the Wednesday night and the Thursday night then we cover that .
248110:60	Well er if you looked at the I 'll give you one or two averages and and I have to say that these are figures that are a mixture of what we know from the industry and what we what we know from our own company .
248201:32	I do n't count retail as sales experience I have to say .
248210:53	So so there are there are a number of camps here I think that we have to get out the way before er
248235:24	Er you can usually you still have to work out and measure what er what the kitchen needs or the bathroom needs
248302:15	Erm I still have to come back in some ways Patrick to er this this no car situation .
248344:31	Okay well if you do n't mind my I have to er because it does affect whether you 're you 're gonna be able to erm sometimes earn the right money .
248347:56	You have your kiddies there to look after you 're going self employed , you 're gonna have to really make sure you 've got enough money I guess .
248360:22	Er I think any married person has got to be in the same situation and so
248380:14	Erm two things I have to protect here today .
248454:10	You would have to be .
248476:15	But you may still have to go ten miles
248487:10	I may have to send you a hundred miles to Aberdeen .
248508:28	My my er my the convincing I have to do in myself and and you have to do it for me is whether this is is the right platform for you .
248508:52	My my er my the convincing I have to do in myself and and you have to do it for me is whether this is is the right platform for you .
248543:55	Now you er it was interesting to hear what your choice is but now I 'm gonna have to step in and say yeah
248579:10	It it has to be the most difficult sell in the world selling selling a piece of blank space .
248629:24	There are two things that we have to look at I need two references
248644:13	You 'll still have to convince them all right ?
248675:12	But you do have to still sit down and get that information .
248685:16	Now by law they must provide something like this booklet .
248766:30	who comes two years later when he has to do the same price again and it costs him money or her .
248783:8	I must point this out and this would be pointed out whichever company you go into .
248785:12	If we had to send you and it 's a big if , we had to send you another hundred mil further sorry another hundred miles , above a hundred miles we will pay you another five percent .
248785:48	If we had to send you and it 's a big if , we had to send you another hundred mil further sorry another hundred miles , above a hundred miles we will pay you another five percent .
248812:16	Mainly because the doctors have to match up each page with copy and that does n't
248901:64	Erm one thing that may hel will help is a compliment slip or a letter heading if we have to lift a logo it 's difficult from a photocopy
248919:21	That 's another thing you have to tell them remind them on the phone .
248951:9	And you have to get a letter of release from the doctor
248958:9	So you have to get a release and it 's somewhere around fifteen hundred pound for that back page .
248988:43	Er let me tell you in any self employed business you 're gonna have to have a car .
249017:23	And I think you you really have to go away and seriously think whether you can
249033:9	But I have to say that they 've been the major percent of them er we think if only they would knuckle down to it they would do it .
249084:9	And I have to say that 's a luxury that most recruiters do n't have but whoever walks through this door I I you know providing all the other things jell erm I have the luxury of offering five companies in which er an individual can go into .
249090:65	Yes you did it was er the advertisement I 'd seen or very similar in the Scotsman newspaper and I must admit when he got all the information I thought damn I should have gone for that myself .
249139:23	Now you have okay so you have to give erm er you 're in an employed status at the moment
249141:9	so you have to give four weeks .
249150:28	but er we obviously recognize that if people have to resign and er from a salaried position .
249227:10	Now you must have at some time or other in advertising closed the deal on the phone .
249314:7	I have to say though first of all especially if they have the larger version
249416:12	But I still have to decide today where to put you or where we where you feel comfortable .
249475:23	Erm that is I 'm gonna have to take that back to the company because that 's a prime example of what you do n't put in .
249571:109	you know as I say I 've not worked in this division but I I know that these have been fully sold , that 's the sort of money and once again that has to be done in three weeks .
249584:15	I think you have to have something as well .
249594:29	Now one of the things that it must be very tempting to do is say , Yippee I 've got my list and go dashing in and phone everybody in sight
249596:28	without any background information on the er sell that has to be qualified .
249661:20	And tend to assume I have to do this anyway .
249664:7	I must admit I 've never I did n't have any surprise that I was I wanted a a deposit cheque .
249738:10	You just have to list out the erm adverts , position , advertiser , estate agent , town .
249742:49	But I was on medical and BUPA hospitals had special arrangements where they did n't have to have a cheque and where did n't have to have a banker 's order .
249742:76	But I was on medical and BUPA hospitals had special arrangements where they did n't have to have a cheque and where did n't have to have a banker 's order .
249744:15	What they did have to have was er an official company or order
249750:10	But they have to be claimed and they 're not paid automatically .
249757:7	You have to decide whether it 's safer in your bank or ours
249780:34	Those are the first ones you contact but you still have to sit down with one of the estate agents and say , Well look what sort of business do you give them ?
249811:9	And I have to say it must be a benefit to have a partner who 's also involved .
249811:24	And I have to say it must be a benefit to have a partner who 's also involved .
249823:11	Erm then that has to be a help .
249864:14	I know that has to be with that .
249874:52	Is the training course the same thing as what John was on in as much he had to get through the training course to get a position ?
249884:14	Sorry I 've had to juggle that we 've got some new documentation just being prepared for that but that 's being er .
249909:20	it may be that you have to stay away .
249912:39	Wherever possible they try not to have that but you may have to stay away .
249949:77	Now I 've got application form , expenses , my notes and I 'll just write up there estates twenty eight two oh I must put wallets down here .
249959:49	If I 'd have said , By the way at the end of this I have to take your photograph it would 've put you off .
249962:17	Well John knows you have to have that .
250157:32	In other words er unlike financial services where you have to go and talk to people about their financial
250192:8	still have to do measurements they ca n't do it on the phone you see .
250203:7	I have to qualify erm you see .
250204:10	Er you have to keep your costs down
250206:10	Okay you have to keep your cost down .
250221:9	So I have to qualify people sometimes you know over the phone
250229:36	but that also includes double glazing all people who have had to view things
250268:58	Er fairly easy to determine what your background 's been for the last twenty six years er and I have to say that 's quite unusual these nowadays , particularly in financial services .
250306:7	You must you must only erm advise people on your product .
250306:14	You must you must only erm advise people on your product .
250331:40	Now that 's a bit of a change for a recruiter to have to do that .
250332:48	Yes I 've had one or two upset people go out of the door I must admit .
250334:53	But I will know fairly quickly if erm if their background is a bit iffy they have to really sell themselves to me .
250383:9	So you have to er put your your presentation properly to those sort of people you know .
250450:101	Trevor how do you feel about what erm you 've heard on the phone from Norman seen in the er brochure seen the products there listened to what erm I have to say about how we qualify people .
250461:12	Well we certainly have to draw them out when when
250463:27	trying to tell them that they they must of course need in fact to spend two and a half thousand pound on a full page in a medical practice booklet er for two years , you 've gotta be punchy on the phone have n't you Trevor ?
250479:20	It 's er and I have to listen to people .
250620:45	Whatever we tell them on the phone is always per annum and we have to be .
250748:38	They er there are just three sizes of ads that we have to
250787:34	And the way that 's determined is er they have to declare the number of patients they have registered .
250914:15	All all you have to worry about is selling the advertising .
250935:64	Cos we know sales people generally do n't like paperwork but I know in financial circles you will have had to have done
250939:45	No if it 's the one thing I know that I do n't have to concern myself with as far as financial services is
250941:9	And we have to we always read the small print as well .
250945:7	You must if if you 're scared if you have any doubts about putting the price of that over the phone then forget doing this .
250969:103	The important thing is that there is a lot of preamble because the guy 's bound to say erm and even if he does n't ask you what the price is you must make sure he knows .
251007:8	You must tell them on the phone after telling them the price and what it 's all about you say , Right when I come round tomorr er whenever to er strike up the deal with you I want the contract signed I need a thirty five percent of the first year 's payment as a deposit cheque .
251022:7	You must tell them that the balance of the first year 's payment will be taken out through a banker 's order .
251024:88	Now if you do n't tell them that on the phone they 'll use the banker 's order , ah now you did n't tell me Trevor that I had to sign a banker 's order is n't er
251033:15	Now you do n't have to pay for all this up front we take in stages .
251047:52	We need a signature one signature on unless of course the company says that two people have got to sign it but you have to find that out .
251047:74	We need a signature one signature on unless of course the company says that two people have got to sign it but you have to find that out .
251049:12	If two people have got to sign the cheque two people have got to sign the banker 's order .
251049:38	If two people have got to sign the cheque two people have got to sign the banker 's order .
251068:18	The other of course we have to know what they want in the we want to know what they want in their ad .
251075:22	But once again on the phone you have to tell them that 's what you want to discuss when you come round .
251126:23	I I would even take I have to say I would even take a erm
251145:10	You just have to have an official order
251190:10	All you have to do is look down for the B numbers , now
251194:36	There are two reasons why we we say it must be claimed .
251260:16	what er if you have to think about it what 's your doubts ?
251288:21	Yeah but surely sorry I I have to why do you question that now ?
251289:7	That has to have been explained to you on the phone .
251290:7	It must have been .
251351:69	but you you ca n't they ca n't they can offer you that job right but it 's qua you have to qualify yourself by going for training .
251490:21	There 's no overlap you have to complete one ?
251581:98	Is the product you know even a description of the product that we 're that they 're going into er will be suffice on the telephone , they do n't have to see these these these er items if they 're described in in er in enough detail .
251584:20	First of all you and I have to agree that is the sort of company that er er you could be involved with er and the other way around .
251616:10	I 'd have to ask one well I 'd like to ask one question first .
251663:36	Oh in fact you 're not even you could never have to go back to that same place but depends on where what you 're doing at the time that assignment comes up for reselling .
251675:87	No er well well if he 's got any sense I I always tell the advertiser I said now the adv I said you as the advertiser have got to keep worrying you may have to chivvy them up .
251675:111	No er well well if he 's got any sense I I always tell the advertiser I said now the adv I said you as the advertiser have got to keep worrying you may have to chivvy them up .
251786:7	I must admit I 've never seen anything like that on schools .
251814:36	I just I just try to work out whether there must be a bigger concentration of schools in this area than than golf clubs .
251819:27	Let me tell you you do not have to worry about continuity of assignment .
251822:10	I I have to say the top earners of course ask for those further away .
251857:7	I have to say once again that this , once again sorry I told somebody else this , this is the most attractive product we do I believe .
251893:29	The important thing about that Richard is you still have to sit down and talk to them about these businesses .
251910:20	And that 's what you have to have up in your mind .
251925:25	If they take up that space you must offer up the back page .
251982:21	between companies we do n't have to retrain them on on
251996:7	You must tell them that you want to pick up a thirty five percent of the first year 's payment .
252005:9	So you have to make sure both sure tho both of those people are there
252021:24	We you do n't er nobody has to worry about that .
252027:27	So the artwork is not a problem you have to get involved in .
252044:9	All you have to do is look for your own number er if you if you have hopefully you 've kept a record of the assignments where you 've earned bonus and you can claim it as soon as that number is published .
252075:15	Sounds very interesting I must admit .
252257:11	Erm I have to say that most of the people that come to us have never been involved in advertising .
252259:30	One of the things I am obviously gonna have to look at is the what you 've done in the last two or three years because traditionally erm we would n't ask van drivers to come along and see us .
252261:15	But there 's there had to have been
252283:33	I think it 's something that they probably have to look at fairly seriously because er I think you do the Government a a lot of favours by going self-employed .
252312:48	And quite honestly if two give er a good references but I would I would have to address that once we decide
252369:49	Certainly it 's not in your background and it 's not in most people 's I have to say .
252418:16	Home security systems I have to say that home improvements is the most likely jeep er leap that people will take first time
252601:18	That 's it you must get a commitment on the phone .
252620:29	Found out there are some people you have to keep your eye on .
252658:10	It it must be on er ante social hours though is it ?
252664:11	Because you have to get out of the premises of the people when they lock up .
252709:7	You have to go and measure up .
252714:44	Once again it brings me in to the point where er double glazers have to go and measure up then do their , I know they 've got lovely lap tops I 've seen them now with their lap top comp their little samples there special catches here .
252716:12	I have n't had to in my this current house because they 're sealed units and I I bought the house new so .
252717:9	Sealed units must have destroyed at lot of the or taken a chunk out of the market .
252772:10	I I must admit I had n't heard that one .
252785:75	Er and we were getting the impression then we were only , not wanting to decry them Bettaware salesmen or Bettaware people , you had to go round now and stick catalogues through people 's doors and go back and
252790:17	And I guess you must have lost erm some of those people would 've gone to N S A especially with their new security product .
252915:34	A lot of people who come to us I have to say .
252943:31	That 's why I always persuade people they must listen .
252971:33	The references I 've given , well I have n't had to give many over the years .
252989:7	We had to pull him off .
253009:13	Well it would have to be I wou looking at it it would be between two would n't it really ?
253155:12	And you 'll have to know your local reputation as well .
253175:28	But even the mediocre ones you know you have to say , Come on chaps there must be more businesses in this .
253175:54	But even the mediocre ones you know you have to say , Come on chaps there must be more businesses in this .
253186:11	You may have to say , Well I 've just been talking to the estate agent about this and er you know on a number occasions he 's sent people along to you er may be you did n't realize that was happening .
253236:73	And I suppose may be it 's may be if somebody got that , that 's why I say if you have to buy the property first .
253407:21	Because that means that the people have got to take this in .
253479:99	Six six contracts all the same print so that if ever we shifted you or wanted you wanted to shift you from estate into to golf or to schools we do n't have to retrain you at all .
253549:59	Do n't need cont er do n't need banker 's orders and they do n't need cheques but we have to have an order from the company .
253579:9	And they have to be claimed .
253590:28	You wo n't forfeit it but you still have to remember you 've gotta claim for it all the time .
253604:47	Erm what I need to do now is just so I 'm gonna have to cross a few things out .
253628:13	Otherwise we might have to
253679:11	If you had to stay away on your two days you 're out with the trainer then we will pay you thirty pound a night subsistence .
253698:33	I 've got that I 've got that I must make a note of this .
253796:247	to be honest because erm it 's and that I wo n't say that there 's a criticism of this particular project which I supported at the time but I think that in future we do need to plan our projects and and there are people in the in the town that are prepared to work , perhaps need a bit of organizing , we need to think about how that might happen , but we must n't first reaction go to professional or semiprofessional help .
253926:79	And erm , and then on the Sunday morning , it was the local tradespeople erm who were taking down the Christmas trees and things , they had to clear up , they did n't have to but they did clear up the mess , it was a disgrace .
253926:103	And erm , and then on the Sunday morning , it was the local tradespeople erm who were taking down the Christmas trees and things , they had to clear up , they did n't have to but they did clear up the mess , it was a disgrace .
253939:37	Only because so many people complain , I mean I just had to do something .
253964:16	Erm and one would have to see the the effectiveness of that .
253968:188	Well shall I tell you that a certain member of the er medical staff , you know they 've got bollards where the staff can put their cars in a certain place , and one member of the staff came out and said , please remove your car it 's in the staff parking part , the person said , yes I even had to move the bollard .
254181:9	Do we have to ?
254283:113	But house er erm what is that that 's the footpath people is n't it , they always come and repair things if they 're told , at least they sh , but obviously they have to work in collaboration with the farmers , er concerned .
254307:71	and I do n't want to , I do n't want to get involved with a lot of money that we 'd have to outlay for upkeep until we 've gone into it thoroughly .
254334:67	I apologize for the urgency on this , but to get it through to the Department of the Environment it has to be lodged at the beginning of February and then up to then by by March .
254421:62	I think if it becomes clear that if it does n't happen in February we 're going to have to really reappraise the situation ,
254457:93	We can only go by what they , overall costing effective solution , we can only go by what they tell us , I mean we we just have to believe what they tell us , do n't we ?
254459:70	Well this is , this is where , this is , I mean this is one of the issues that has to be brought out in any discussions concerning partnership .
254505:14	That , that game has got to be continued .
254625:12	We do n't have to get onto thin section , to larger section bearings .
254682:54	Yes , yes , if , if , if wo n't go to them , then you 'll have to learn German and get over there John .
254697:13	I 'll just have to keep an an
254748:15	And now we simply have to think of the name of the French month .
254765:11	Now all you have to do is think of number five for me , cos you just say the number .
254932:36	Was it a game where you had numbers and you had to stand up and say your number ?
254946:7	You have to remember your number .
254955:84	Well that 's an odd number so that means there will be ten in one team and eleven in another team and the ten team someone will have to go twice .
255177:38	What are we really talking about when saying we would have to reduce the numbers of staff ?
255373:7	Teresa must have been productive fairly
255433:34	It 's also one where the chance of success must be fairly high .
255479:199	I was going to say that , I mean if we do do that why do n't we move to a position when , I know it 's not finalized yet , the P As do the twenty six fives , and we try and adapt Sarah to do the whole s the whole of the four sub teams , ma maybe the threshold has to come down a bit , but but at least we 've got some sort of parity of working throughout
255483:30	I think that may be something we have to look at if er if we 're not in a position to recruit another complaints examiner .
255633:10	It would have to be a fair , fair accumulation of those two factors .
255709:11	I would have to see , I think .
255903:10	It would have to be , given what we 've just been talking about .
255929:43	A bit like asking what heaven 's like and being told you have to die first .
256037:63	We will see what we can come up with that 'll be weather proof , we may just have to keep on going out er sticking labels
256163:81	Is it possible when we get a new member of , that , not that they 're brought round , which I think must be frightfully intimidating , but that we are told , and therefore we can drop in and say , hello , I 'm so and so , just to say hello .
256297:25	I 've checked your books and I have to say that I 'm very pleased .
256450:7	We have to be exactly where we are .
256753:42	Always Now it does n't mean to say every twenty four hours it has to quickly spin round .
256852:63	Er shh , we 'll do it with cos there 's more sea over there and I 'm going to have to draw some plans .
256864:16	Here , I 'll have to draw that line on again anyway , is daylight .
256968:13	You do n't have to do it perfectly round because the earth is n't perfectly round .
256969:12	You do n't have to draw the continent and oceans exactly as they are because it 's a diagram .
256970:15	What you do have to be is neat , your labelling is in pen , your drawing is in ?
257012:10	Yes you have to to explain what 's happening .
257027:24	And some of the others I still have to look at .
257042:103	Jody perhaps you could like would like to think , if you want us to listen to your playing this afternoon I would like you to listen to what I have to say this morning please .
257144:8	They had to go and give him some support and they put up quite a good fight .
257160:37	I tell you what we could do cos Mr might have to stay .
257177:7	They have to go for a dental inspection
257358:38	Therefore we accept that the actual provision within the city er will have to be considerably less than the calculated requirement for the city .
257393:10	I would have to say that erm in broad terms , that the existing policy has been acceptable erm in er terms of a planning basis for the city .
257397:119	Erm my reference was in part to the Secretary of State 's notice of approval of the last alteration of the structure plan , where he said he accepted that some of the provision York provision would have to made outside the ci city boundaries .
257425:12	And it would have to be found er if we were to move to to the er position that Mr Curtis has said about the total need , it would have to be found somewhere else .
257425:98	And it would have to be found er if we were to move to to the er position that Mr Curtis has said about the total need , it would have to be found somewhere else .
257475:48	I would answer that we are talking about a change of use but I have to add the reminder that the largest area inside the city is currently British Rail land .
257494:115	but erm , sorry the reason I 'm raising my eyebrows is that the people who would come to live in the new settlement if it was to happen , are people who would otherwise have to live somewhere else in in the county
257567:63	It says the guidance has some implications for adjoining areas and neighbouring county and metropolitan district councils are asked to have to regard to it when reviewing and altering their statutory development plans .
257591:71	They 're almost always surrounded by existing long term industry , they 're not the sorts of places we want Leeds residents to have to live in the future .
257687:7	They must make a contribution .
257768:19	And the other thing you have to bear in mind is that at the time the original structure plan was drawn up , they were n't talking about the er the structural employment problems that we are at the moment .
257991:18	Well i by definition it must be if it excludes all A classes for example .
258079:232	And so whilst the popular perception of Harrogate will remain of it as being a very prosperous and pretty borough er with everything going for it , in fact there 's a very serious unemployment problem of structural er magnitude and we felt that the county structure plan had not acknowledged this erm special difficulty that Harrogate was facing , and had merely applied as we heard this morning the standard formula as it were to Harrogate , as it had to all the other local authority areas in the county .
258123:10	We would have to deal with that as and when it arose .
258151:54	I try to update that wherever I can , and it is very difficult , we have to use the annual census of employment and historic records .
258213:64	Er so any clarification you can give about er er Mr er with Mr Potter 's comment that we would have to wait and see each one on its circumstances when we talking earlier about the industrial change of use makes me twitch , because it 's lack of precision which all of us are trying to eliminate as much as we can in this process .
258246:20	I think yes er we have to accept that er the use classes order would allow that erm , but what we would anticipate is that in terms of I five , the local planning authority would be would allocate specific sites related to I five .
258263:10	It 'll have to be found somewhere else in Greater York .
258266:148	Ideally the Civic Society would like to see far more drastic policy change , possibly thinking in terms of forty hectares but we realize the minimum possible would be the thirty point five hectares which is hanging over from the first phase of the structure plan , and so that must of course be regarded as committed .
258277:21	If you 're going to have to find a much larger area you have to spread your net wider to find more and more sites for development which you might otherwise have been able to save from development , and there will an environmental cost , a cost to the quality of life of people living nearby because sites you might not wish to have developed must be included to find the target figure of industrial development .
258277:44	If you 're going to have to find a much larger area you have to spread your net wider to find more and more sites for development which you might otherwise have been able to save from development , and there will an environmental cost , a cost to the quality of life of people living nearby because sites you might not wish to have developed must be included to find the target figure of industrial development .
258277:214	If you 're going to have to find a much larger area you have to spread your net wider to find more and more sites for development which you might otherwise have been able to save from development , and there will an environmental cost , a cost to the quality of life of people living nearby because sites you might not wish to have developed must be included to find the target figure of industrial development .
258281:156	Over-provision has a sort of knock-on effect that er whatever we provide this time , we shall be asked to provide at the next revision of the structure plan and so if we can keep some land back this time , then that might be what we offer next time , we have to roll forward the structure plan .
258321:50	If migration er increases to a hundred percent of past trends then the employment provision will have to increase also .
258352:129	Erm because he would like to make a comment on the exceptions policy , he has n't been invited to participate tomorrow , er I have exercised some latitude and said yes I will be happy to hear what he has to say , erm there is a prescribed time limit of which he is aware .
258353:37	The rest of us will take note of what he has to say and we 'll bear it in mind tomorrow .
258440:50	We er went as far as we could without er erm finding that we would have to delete allocations that we were making or produce unrealistic er development sites erm the the figure of er twenty five hectares simply means that we 're ratcheting the the whole thing down to a point at which it ca n't be sustained .
258464:8	We had to look at where the opportunities were for development in Greater York as a whole rather than looking at individual district elements , and in terms of land available , erm Mr Steel appears to have included some sites which we classify as land held in reserve , which we do n't normally count towards the land availability targets , although we do acknowledge that it is there .
258559:14	er we 'd have to insist upon a extensive landscaping compensations , erm er to in order for it to be to go ahead , er so I think the increase we would be looking at environmentally sensitive site .
258687:29	We 're not asking R P G two has to have it both ways if if that idea is er is there at all .
258741:12	And therefore it must by definition be the case that anything over and above the one hundred and twenty two which I know Selby have not challenged on on on the basis of the assessment , er anything over and above that hundred and twenty two must siphon investment and economic activity from somewhere else because it 's not local , it 's not it 's not unemployed , it 's not local needs and it 's not migration .
258741:140	And therefore it must by definition be the case that anything over and above the one hundred and twenty two which I know Selby have not challenged on on on the basis of the assessment , er anything over and above that hundred and twenty two must siphon investment and economic activity from somewhere else because it 's not local , it 's not it 's not unemployed , it 's not local needs and it 's not migration .
258771:35	Do do these criteria operate independently or do they all have to be met to be acceptable ?
258811:7	It must be a good
258908:105	I think really I can only repeat the County Council 's position here chairman that we we do have sympathy with er the District Council 's position and the particular problems that the District Council have to face .
258997:64	unless the local printer 's very cleaver somehow and got that advertising to to sponsor er the booklet they 've had to charge for it .
258999:9	Or they have to do what we will never do and that is take the quality out of it .
259049:56	but he did I a favour at by bringing out er a law that said that they must provide something like this .
259054:7	They have to promote themselves now just as they 've got to get bums on seats as they say .
259208:29	Yeah it 's one thing that er we have to reem reemphasize to people and usually I do it on the phone , that if people have got businesses erm the way look at it there 's such a commitment by this company to
259216:10	We not have to give we 're obliged to give in terms of to keep the company going .
259235:7	That has to be
259239:60	We 're still we 're still there but erm it it was the number of people you had to approach to get one into you .
259407:25	They have they by law they have to .
259409:13	By law they have to put somebody er put somewhere in there for people to smoke .
259491:56	or something like that , er or your husband even with his cheque book , then you just have to tell us .
259493:13	But if you have to tell us that you wanna week off we need some notice .
259504:25	So that 's really you literally only have to listen to the phone call and turn up .
259541:7	We have to harden ourselves up for this .
259632:87	And I recommend to anybody who goes on the school , I 'm sure they do on the training course , that the first opportunity I would have to address erm the con er the staff meeting , you just say this is what I who I am this is why I 'm here I 've got a list of businesses which the school has provided with me already but I I will I may erm if I bump into you in the corridor I may just say do you know anybody else .
259645:14	Yes that coffee must be .
259699:56	As a result , marginal product which is the slope of the total product curve and average product must be the same at L 2 units of labour .
259701:24	Right , as a result average products must fall beyond O L 2 units of labour .
259707:188	This relationship is n't just common to product relationships it 's the same in cost revenue relationships as well Okay , so so what that diagram is saying in symbolic terms is that if the slope of the ideal product of labour curve , right , if D L P D A P L by D L positive , then the marginal product of labour must be greater than the average product of labour .
259963:15	group , erm , must take those up at some stage and and transfer them to the wall .
260030:97	And this has been accepted by an authority of people on site , erm , presentations with management authority you know , they 've all been told that they must follow union rules .
260033:40	You know , so before I approach them , they 've gonna have to quit the union
260059:103	But , they 're going to be made on , in fact , it 's going to be pushed rather heavily they change to this new system , and they 're going to have to meet some of the costs of development of the new system .
260123:11	Suppose to have to
260155:41	I tell you , I make that point , that we we have to , to try and not vet , but to check you out , if we 've got somebody that 's understandable , realistic , because we have had examples on this course , where erm , with the best will in the world , and the systems are the right hand of God , erm , the projects that people have brought along , the case studies that people have brought along , wo n't work .
260374:103	The first one is the erm , er , or so , when directs authority over somebody , will , we do n't , we ca n't tell them to do it , we have to influence or persuade them to do something .
260388:85	Every if the reason that something 's gotta change is obvious to everybody , then you do n't really need to have any influence over their It usually has to be some considered opinion that you want
260389:134	Yes , I mean , if it 's blatant and obvious , and there 's only one option er , that 's the bit about choice , if there 's only way of doing it , and one option , then you do n't have to influence people .
260458:20	it is , and I have to agree with them , and so would you .
260518:9	This you have to recognise .
260527:54	I 've done this before , and it did n't work and I 'm gonna have to do it again , and Q E D , it is n't gonna work .
260563:25	Well , story of telling you had to do it ,
260627:13	You do n't have to start at a attitude , but yeah , if you 're watching for them , and you start to see signals , you need to be aware of these , because that 's really the situation , is n't it , that 's why I think you to be aware of influence .
260969:48	I 'm afraid the tide has now turned , and er , this negotiation will have to come to an end .
261021:38	Perhaps we had , or we had no idea what they had to offer .
261039:72	So some of those are items you ca n't satisfy what you need , anyway , so it 's gonna obviously have to be , somebody 's got to go and satisfy some of those .
261069:36	Okay , I think you both recognise that we 're gonna have to make , but we realise it then , in the case of horses there are only ten possible ,
261073:15	So we would have have to make sacrifices in some respects .
261074:35	Right , so you recognised early on , that you would have to make a move for some of the stances that you wanted .
261242:71	I think if you were gonna s use any other situation to this , with the quantity of information that you 'd have to , to record , as we 're going through ,
261244:8	Would have to be er probably a lot lower , this would probably be a maximum , because , I felt I needed a bit of time , to just sort of , you know , pass information .
261292:27	I do n't know how many times I have to say , that we 've we 've been there and we know all about this .
261308:7	He had to show other people , that he had gone because that was what boss 's did .
261310:9	And he had to do that every year in order to satisfy his stance his hat that he was wearing , that he was actually being the boss , and knocking the workers down , look I 'm holding down , what twenty-two point on six , er and he believed that my need was that I could go back to my manager , and say , look I got him up to two point one , .
261333:147	It 's er , obviously , you 'll need to give them a briefing , so they can play the character , but to the end of degree , ' cos you 'll need to respond to things that they say , as indeed , you 'll have to back in influencing situation , back in your own department , back in your own ground .
261405:26	If she suddenly erm , you gonna have to , sort of , do this , I think it 's ridiculous , but you know .
261433:127	If you want to have a lunch , and then to just shoot off afterwards , we would probably get you in the staff lunch , I should think but I 'll need to check that , if not you 'll have to wait till half past twelve , to have a , to have a lunch .
261558:103	The seventy two million erm for this Committee is the labour that would involve roughly er nett savings of about one million er pounds because we and no doubt all the routes of course have to look at the social budget and where their priorities are and in order for us to er do other things perhaps indication in relation to and also will provide primary school er budgets .
261581:122	Erm we are still not going to enough we we need something like just over half a million to do all the schemes er which er and we could do next year and this Committee is going to have to decide there , which er town centres are actually going to be done and which are going to be erm left out .
261584:9	This route must be taken very seriously er rights of way , planning investigation for the environment which as I did problems the other sources in terms of right of way , in terms of unresourcing rest of the backlog giving instructions in terms of .
261620:184	And er can can we scrape away to say Chairman that er , you know this , this , this situation er it is not to do with government policies , we are paying a very heavy price to this country for world recession as we have paid this very high price , very very large amounts of money that had to be used for people who are unfortunate enough to fall out of employment .
261638:74	It is also that the the maintenance of our road schedules continues to a very high standard and so we are n't er , we have to take er the money from that source er and I will be hoping that perhaps in this we may find that we do not need to raid that particular fund so that we may find
261706:38	Chairman I 'll get the ball rolling I suppose erm I have to deal with the ludicrous sh statement from County Council now the savings , proposed savings on the fire cover review .
261728:85	Er but calming is not the only issue er er calming is is important and we recognise that but it seems to me that with that you have to enhance reliable public transport .
261729:7	We have to see more people being encouraged to use the buses and not their own cars .
261730:28	If you simply put up but people still have to use their cars to get from A to B you 're not actually improving the environment at all and it seems that adding added habits habits habits er it it seems to me that proposals that we have represented and which create improvement in a number of areas or reduce the cut in a number of areas will actually produce a much more balanced programme for nineteen ninety four ninety five .
261737:7	We have to look into the effectiveness of the .
261741:20	However , the we have recently had to incur extra expenditure because the road that were put in looking at one hundred er er were found to be too high especially for the services and er place er committee which er throughout that it was very difficult but apparatus you know moving fire .
261788:25	demands and I think we really have to address this .
261800:11	Chairman I have to but I moved conservative resolution and I am now the debate problem .
261809:211	That 's what we got out of Chairman and is that nine hundred thousand pounds of by simply modifying er the fire do will have provided that substantial sum of money completely reorganise review of the fire service er it would have er brought this other ten fire , whole time fire fighters etc. , etc. , and these savings because of the of those two groups over there we have to identify it 's stage , put them on the table and then be very prudent in the way this is really the .
261816:7	I must bring your attention to Standing Order C A matter in hand .
261888:45	That started because I think Charles saw that they were eventually going had to give way to twenty additional fire fighters and they were looking for safety within the service .
261910:58	Design work cannot be turned on and off er it is er feel flowing continuous process and we must be particularly must be er as well as practical work in the future .
261910:67	Design work cannot be turned on and off er it is er feel flowing continuous process and we must be particularly must be er as well as practical work in the future .
261912:61	I think what we 've all to pay for this erm that we will perhaps it will have to come from somewhere and again of the Council Planning Department as we we do erm continue .
262009:34	Initially , I would stress initially the reference side of has to be ten per cent of the the authorisation the best thing since sliced bread .
262020:8	People must be allowed say in the development of their own environment .
262023:17	Not blue circle , we have to have allegiance to them .
262067:26	Er I was very conscious that we must be careful , say do nothing and certainly to accept no resolution which might even appear we do n't have a on planning application and this is .
262070:30	Erm the variety of the words which protestors have to stress their anxieties , erm have shown er this is not an orchestrated campaign , although it is er very well organised .
262080:55	That raises matters principle because under the present law it is a public very large vehicle which has to be alert .
262089:45	Erm I only want to say it is very important that we must do nothing to sort of prejudice the outcome of the consideration of the planning application environment cases sub committee , erm at a later erm stage .
262092:48	Erm that it it it will be erm that by law the County Council must consider any planning application which is made erm to it for a particular site .
262093:53	We do n't use sites , we do n't make planning applications , applicants do but we have to consider that we ca n't say we do n't like it , go elsewhere .
262094:10	We do have to consider it .
262096:8	We have to look at the application er on its merits in the particular erm circumstances and I 'll tell you something which we will certainly have to do erm and I I will say , I will say this in sort of due respect erm , because we are grateful to them that we can see .
262096:85	We have to look at the application er on its merits in the particular erm circumstances and I 'll tell you something which we will certainly have to do erm and I I will say , I will say this in sort of due respect erm , because we are grateful to them that we can see .
262126:51	As far as the other aspect is concerned , that there is no something that would have to be dealt with on its merits taking account of the arguments for and against .
262127:64	As I said you mention it may be something which is out of our field and we 'll have to make sure that the arguments for and against the problems the problem .
262130:28	The question erm we are told that we have got to take into account the actions of er true to me that the er reference site , therefore , we must carry on as er .
262130:93	The question erm we are told that we have got to take into account the actions of er true to me that the er reference site , therefore , we must carry on as er .
262195:17	and I think we must recognise that it is only that many of the questions and questionnaire had they been displayed of what they wanted to propose .
262219:14	The Consultants at least have to recognise , they could n't fix that the closure of was strongly opposed but it was a mystery to all of us except obviously Mr on the December how they were unable to nevertheless , to accept a little dissimilar rejection of part of my and the associated increased in the despite the fact that seven different people are of the same several different people same margin Mr but not .
262222:116	I if you do n't like the sound of it Mrs then I 'm sorry for you but this is what democracy is all about and it is about time you listened to what people have to say .
262238:154	Er the Director of Transportation recognises that , it was said that he 's happy to to await the outcome of liberations by that er District Council and that 's what the Conservative group has suggested that we do but if he wants you to recognise that every policy has to be accepted , the way in which they have performed time and decided to be addressed by my members of of all parties and therefore I urge you to support the Conservative resolutions I now put forward .
262240:137	Er I really ca n't accept that er general questionnaire responded to sixty five per cent twelve per cent of sixty five per cent of you will recognise and agree that changes were needed that are existing now erm and so there must be evidence as and when the erm district erm district erm .
262245:10	However I must start by saying that er the County Council are giving so many people the hundred and twenty nine thousand people who signed contingence .
262297:14	what you 'd have to do
262370:97	There is concern about funding for the Children Act and it 's too important to start scoring political points , whether there 's a General Election or not t and I must admit I was off , I was off ill , off work during the week of the Tory Party Conference .
262375:110	They will actually responsibility of Local Government and er we 've tried to put in here something that even Conservative Councillors could support , even though it 's attacking Conservative Ministers , cos they must actually believe in Local Government to actually serve on Local Government , one would think , but er , but th the problems of under-funding are th could be very serious .
262453:7	I must also say that I resent the tendency of the Act to line the pockets of lawyers out of the tragic situations of families and children in trouble .
262499:75	I apologise on behalf of Council to the members of the press who are here , and to the Council officers who have to endure this and I am only grateful that there are not members of the public here to witness this total farce .
262558:129	What is now worrying us extremely about Local Government in Britain , in any Labour Authority , which is spreading now like a cancer in , that officers are not trusted now to even take the sick list of decisions so there has to be another sub-committee .
262620:29	Now the problem is that the Tories do not have to privatise the National Health Service to damage it .
262636:7	That must , should , worry you in terms of the case that you 're putting across .
262639:12	We do n't have to .
262640:9	All we have to do is tell it as it actually is and then trust the people themselves to decide .
262672:130	I 've sat on the district management board of Health Authority for four years and watched Labour Councillors coming sometimes , often not coming at all , sitting there saying nothing , debating very little in the way of useful contributions until , I have to say , Councillor came along and er a er , sorry to get you unpopular with the rest of your colleagues
262674:35	It 's no way to manage a Health Authority to have to have people coming along there to t guard their own vested interests .
262801:7	I must confess to be somewhat surprised to see the Labour Group wanting to debate thisu this issue again after their lack lustre performance in Committee and Council on the previous debates on this subject and today 's been no different .
262823:129	What is now worrying us extremely about Local Government in Britain , in any Labour Authority , which is spreading now like a cancer in , that officers are not trusted now to even take the sick list of decisions so there has to be another sub-committee .
262953:10	You only have to see some of run down estates for the evidence .
263115:13	In return you must promise Council or that you will outline to the people of the Labour Party 's plans for the N H S , and state where you will get the funding from .
263168:86	We 're not gonna waste time explaining things to you and fortunately , through our friends , through out friends in the T and A , we do n't have to waste time .
263178:45	The first visit to Brussels , the amend , the first visit to Brussels we had to go and bail you out because the Commission , the Commission , we could have been in this er
263228:61	They 've not looked has n't British industry because of the attacks it 's been under on what Europe has to offer in terms of better training , better health and safety etcetera and we need to bring that information to them .
263237:27	The and their self-opinionated Premier , Jacques Delores , must be told clearly that we stand for co-operation of Western style democracy , not the old Eastern block style of all encompassing socialist state with the dead hand of Brussels directing policies , as Moscow did with the U S S R. Freedom of the independent nation and people must confer .
263237:170	The and their self-opinionated Premier , Jacques Delores , must be told clearly that we stand for co-operation of Western style democracy , not the old Eastern block style of all encompassing socialist state with the dead hand of Brussels directing policies , as Moscow did with the U S S R. Freedom of the independent nation and people must confer .
263239:36	Yes , Euro Cities is an organisation of Brussels but it must not be allowed to dominate the proceedings and massage and manage the cities .
263240:7	It must be free city to city co-operation within a loose association with Brussels .
263242:7	This must be avoided in Euro Cities .
263243:40	Euro Cities can be a sound tool for co-operation and our officers must be at the forefront with the Chambers of Trade of Commerce , and Development Association and all , all of which have expertise in Europe .
263245:13	However , we must ask , what of our Euro M P 's ?
263250:38	We need to liaise with Europe as a city but there must be three provisos .
263268:8	Councillor must also remember that , and other major companies have a overseas branches of their company .
263323:34	He explained to the delegates there the mountain they have to climb before they even reach the status that we have in Britain as Local Authorities .
263421:40	If we look at regional Governments across Europe that do n't have to go cap in hand every time to some deadbeat in White Hall , right , they go straight to Europe and they network across Europe and they exchange ideas and things happen .
263422:12	What we have to do in , and we 've done it very well , and it 's a massive tribute to the quality of staff that we 've had working on this , that we 've done this .
263545:243	I entirely accept that if er , four years on we were still doing the same thing that then they 'd be er , some erm , requirement for er , cutting back but I think it is also worth reminding ourselves that due to the action of this conservative government in er , forcing the local government review , er , we are facing the spectre er , of an additional full meeting of this council , and indeed we have had to er , respond to that government initiative .
263550:149	Now there are occasions where members legitimately need to attend committees to speak to something in which they have an interest but the difficulty is , that in the past when we had permanent chairman , a member who wanted to attend the meeting had to ask the permission of that permanent chairman and there are occasions when that permanent chairman thought , well , there is no need for that member to attend and he has said no .
263593:40	I thought actually we had a standing order already that claims had to be in within a certain time limit
263635:13	er , I must , I always claim the attendance allowance when it has been as executive , as I 've been the one member from Wiltshire attending .
263654:77	We 're looking after ourselves , er , but we 're not prepared to look after them , and , I 'm afraid I have to oppose it .
263669:78	Although joking apart I urge members to support this on principle , I think we should put this in and then it will have to be considered next year , how , where the money will , will come from , and I think that we should establish it that married women with dependant children will get some allowance to help them to stand and represent their communities .
263675:58	But I would agree with Mr , that it does add a further pressure , it means we have to have a real review of erm , how we pay allowances in order to stay within our budget limit , which I think is two hundred and two thousand for the current year , and erm , a little bit more for next year , according to the previous paper .
263714:84	I , I er , you would not expect me to continue with the euphoria which you were trying to create earlier , and er , I have to say that I suppose that you would n't er , be proposing any different budget to this would you , in the circumstances that you 've got .
263728:203	You 've had a bit of luck there , you might turn the other way next year , and you might find that you 've got an increased number of police retiring , and if you have , you 're going to find extreme pressure on the police budget , and you will see that there is the reductions that the Chief Constable told you he would have to make if that happened .
263748:74	Now clearly , we 're not going to pretend that there are n't going to be problems in the future that we may have to address .
263756:21	The young people following us will have to pay for our mistakes if we cut on maintenance now .
263761:37	But the other figure I think he 's , he 'll have to recheck is his figure on highways structural maintenance , because in fact two and a half million 's in the base budget and one and a half million 's in the approved list of thirty-seven bids at at er , priority number two .
263899:103	I doubt whether the working party will get any further than recommending the status quo , because I 'm absolutely sure in my own mind , that it is a duty that this council has to support village schools , where the parents support them , and where they 're educationally beneficial , to support them in the village communities , because they are , they have other importance than just education .
263916:44	If he puts a thing in a box , it means you really have got to read this , and worry about it , but I think he 's fairly happy with the progress on police training and police communication arrangements .
263928:45	Yes sir , county council could make that decision , it would first though have to consider a report from the education committee , under the education act .
263938:25	But there is the other argument that has to be taken off , is that of , there is money , and I , we all would like to say that we 'd like to pour as much money into education as we feel we could spend .
263940:36	Therefore , we 're left with a certain pot and we must manage that the best way possible in providing the best education , not only for children in village schools , but in towns and every of large or medium size throughout this county .
263943:9	And that has to be maintained in the future .
263950:7	It has to be done evenly across the board , in the rural and urban areas , or else we will fight every tooth and nail to make sure that we , our schools that we represent do not suffer .
263995:51	Erm , if you ask for what actions we could take , then we 'll have to work out a way of doing it .
264044:15	I think we have to be very careful we do n't take reactions which actually negate some of the work and the common sense that has been undertaken at the moment .
264104:54	I think that the genetic er , testing that was , that is now law , has to go a long way towards finding criminals , who once they 've been tested will find it very difficult to commit crime again , because they 're on record , and they 'll be on computer record .
264123:61	I , I do n't think Mr ' s actually got any very reasonable criticisms at all , and we must again say , as we often do to Conservatives now , who do you think 's been running the country for the last fourteen or fifteen years ?
264139:115	Erm , this idea that the police had more more money , yes they have had more money , what , what er , has been very conveniently ignored is the enormous amount of money we 've had to spend on special protection duties .
264285:109	And of course , That 's right yes , make them do the test first and of course , you may very well need some specialists depending again on as we said , whatever your team has got to do .
264288:64	There is another test that I want to refer to , that we ca n't actually do , because you have to be qualified to do this test , and it 's very , very complicated , and all the rest of it .
264309:9	So you have to bear that in mind as well .
264329:7	There must be another way of looking at things .
264338:99	And having done that , you then need some people , in fact , so you do need the two types of people and if you are the team leader , you have to find some way of getting them to work together .
264367:9	So they have to do it , to be shot through a cannon , and off a see-saw and various things like this .
264417:20	yes , anything else ? there must be something else you can put up there to make it er ,
264583:96	You , you , you build this up , now , and then you get to the point where you 're going to say to yourself , well , do we have to do anything about it ?
264604:23	You 've got , you 'd have to decide , but by looking at that , you could then start to tick off the things that that would help to solve .
264639:40	Whereas the more ideas you get , the more things you have to look at , the more chances you 've got of getting something that 's really good and unusual .
264641:50	You allow people to say what they like , write it down , you have to set a time limit because people get tired , it is a very sort of , it takes a lot of energy to do this , and concentrate on it .
264762:27	I think that was how they had to be , and they 'd be out in this very dangerous environment looking for food , and suddenly they 'd be aware that they 'd , the were coming .
264797:95	Because when you do run across the road , you get to the other side , and you 're thinking , good gracious , that was a close shave , I 'll have to sit down for a minute , I think I 'll have a cup of coffee or something .
264828:43	That was first thing in the morning , at two o' clock he had to be brought home .
264929:8	We have got to have them , but really the people we want to push the country on , you know because people have got to get us somewhere , these are the A types are n't they ?
264929:77	We have got to have them , but really the people we want to push the country on , you know because people have got to get us somewhere , these are the A types are n't they ?
264950:69	And in the end the child 's internalising , I 'm loved because I work hard , and this is what I have to do .
264983:12	Yes , I have to tell you , you 're a temporary one .
265010:24	There are some things that do have to be done to a certain standard .
265011:16	But most things do not have to be done to perfection .
265042:57	I wonder why , I wonder why you get that when you go home , there must be certain signs .
265052:44	So you 're not really concentrating on the television , because you do n't have to .
265096:48	Whatever it might be for you , but something that you 're going to have to be thinking about , and while you 're thinking about that you cannot be thinking about work .
265120:15	All these A types that must be you know , top of industry in our society .
265131:102	And whereas you can see if you might have A type behaviour sort of lower down , , you think if you really want to rise , you 're going to have to cope .
265147:19	But it is , you have to accept , you ca n't blame the boss , the circumstances you 're in , and things like that , it is the way you react to it .
265163:9	And people have got to be able to cope with the challenges .
265242:33	The communist want to return to this old policy but had to consolidate his position first with rent and interest reductions .
265250:46	Moderate land reform was a cau cautious approach in in that how that the communists had to maintain a fragile balanc balance between the two fundamental aims of the maintenance of support and the increase of production .
265264:46	They wanted to get rid of the feudal not capitalist elements of landlords which had to be destroyed .
265280:7	They had to reconcile the interests of poor peasants with the larger national goals of providing for the war and this meant that how the C C P had to take a more moderate erm policy .
265280:87	They had to reconcile the interests of poor peasants with the larger national goals of providing for the war and this meant that how the C C P had to take a more moderate erm policy .
265284:104	If its policy seemed more or less radical at different times it was n't necessarily changing its view of land reform , but it was keeping its final goal of socialism in sight so it had to make short term expediencies .
265289:263	Erm it may have been deliberate in that how the Par Party could n't be seen as too radical in order to maintain er as broad a support as possible and allow the peasants to erm give them leeway to do what they wanted to do , but erm it 's quite interesting though that whatever the Communist Party did , people were going to respond in which ever way they wanted to whether or not there was a law there , but they still had to sort of erm establish their legitimacy .
265290:177	Erm als other problems which arose from the outline land law was in its deliberate ambiguity er in its deliberate erm tt sort of ambiguity because it left reg it left the law to be interpreted by regional areas which meant that how that erm in some places they totally misinterpreted the law but the Communist Party had to have this flexibility because China was such a vast country and you could n't just impose one policy per se across the country .
265292:98	One , firstly , if equal distribution was to be achieved peasant mobilization and increase produc erm if equally distribution was to achieve its goals of peasant mobilization and increased production , there had to be enough land available to bring most peasants up to an independent pe peasant status without encroaching upon the existing er middle peasants .
265295:22	The , in effect the Communist Party had to choose between either equal distribution or the preservation of the middle peasants .
265302:48	Erm by nineteen forty eight erm the Communist Party had argued that three conditions had to be there for land reform to take place and that was that how that the area had to be militarily stable , the majority of peasants erm rich peasants had to be mobilized er had to want to be demanding land reform and the Party cadres there had to be adequate in numbers and quality .

265302:158	Erm by nineteen forty eight erm the Communist Party had argued that three conditions had to be there for land reform to take place and that was that how that the area had to be militarily stable , the majority of peasants erm rich peasants had to be mobilized er had to want to be demanding land reform and the Party cadres there had to be adequate in numbers and quality .
265302:200	Erm by nineteen forty eight erm the Communist Party had argued that three conditions had to be there for land reform to take place and that was that how that the area had to be militarily stable , the majority of peasants erm rich peasants had to be mobilized er had to want to be demanding land reform and the Party cadres there had to be adequate in numbers and quality .
265318:59	That there was a that they were gonna be trailing behind the peasant movement and that how that they had to sort of get a hold over all the all the changes that were happening in the country .
265378:154	Basically they 're just telling the Party to consider the demands of the peasants and do what the peasants want but then er then in the first paragraph they say that you ought to erm they ought to support the masses in their erm implementation of agrarian reform , you have to give them planned guidance so it 's almost that how they 're telling the cadres to go out there and almost manipulate the peasants demands into more of a communist one .
265392:89	Erm and then okay you , a bit later on you 'd say well yes w we , we need to be a bit careful about this erm we must n't be too hard on , on the middle peasant etcetera .
265412:125	because they do n't give a specific definition as to what a landlord is or a rich peasant or a middle peasant meant that how that there was a lot of flexibility within that and it 's only later that they have to reissue those two documents on how to analyze the classes which erm which had been published in nineteen thirty which they felt that you know the Party 's moving too far away , but why did n't they do it at the time ?
265566:32	I think the fact that the Japanese had surrendered must have something to do with it cos then they probably had a chance to attack the people who 'd er collaborated with the Japanese .
265624:78	Er that they are changing a whole range o of non-economic variables which allow the peasant the world to see the world does n't have to be like this we can actually question the landlord and not only can we get away with it but we can get something out of it .
265634:176	Also what struck me was now that they they 're not fighting the Japanese erm they 're not required to make the sacrifices of war that they were so perhaps they 're going to think right let 's see what we can make out of this , I do n't , I no longer have to pay X tax because
265641:127	But then why would Mao in nineteen forty five say that how that they 'd made a major concession to land to the tiller but that this is a correct one and they 're going to , that land reform has to be taken in stages and they 're going to first of all reduce rent and , I mean er
265643:69	what you 're implying is that how that they had a radical policy in mind but because of the war it had to be moderated but I , somehow I tend to believe the reverse , that how that they may have continued the moderate policy but was forced into it because of circumstances to , forced to erm into radicalizing their policies .
265796:73	I think Mao was quite keyed up on the whole situation , I think he realized that to win the war they had to erm adjust the mass support very carefully , and I think that 's basically what this I think that 's why two months later they er they er gave up this document cos he was worried then they 'd lose the middle peasants ' support .
265816:45	Now if , if you accept the ten percent owning the eighty percent , there must 've been enough but the poor are not getting it .
265819:104	When he says that erm that sort of , that 's what the C C P leadership thought and so they thought that if they were n't getting the land then something must be going wrong with the policy
265834:7	it must be possible
265841:27	if you 've got that much land there must be enough .
265854:76	And therefore in the process of trying to bring the poor up to er some of the land of the middle peasant had to be taken and that 's a problem is n't it ?
265939:154	But is , is , I mean w w what we 've said so far is that the problem with this is that there is n't enough land and therefore it encroaches on the middle peasant and , and that 's the problem , that 's the reason you had to change your policy .
265957:7	There must 've been with erm in forty seven was it the encirclement campaign where they allowed the nationalists to sort of drive through the , I do n't know the defences , they must 've been fairly certain of their support in certain areas by then .
265957:108	There must 've been with erm in forty seven was it the encirclement campaign where they allowed the nationalists to sort of drive through the , I do n't know the defences , they must 've been fairly certain of their support in certain areas by then .
265960:9	so they must 've been fairly sure of their support to allow them to come into an area of villages .
265972:80	a different set of policies but but as of forty seven the strategy is we need to mobilize the masses quickly behind us now , there must be enough land to give the er peasants enough .
266003:80	And , and , and , and , and , and are , are there points in , in the speech where he specifically says you , you must protect the interests of the middle peasant
266020:15	At that point you have to call a halt to it .
266082:68	Once you 've gone too far , and I think this is where the centre is crucial , the centre has got to , to say we have gone , this is the point where we have gone too far and we need to stop .
266119:89	I mean as soon as it 's clear that the middle peasants are coming under pressure December nineteen forty seven , he begins to issue statements , we must protect the middle peasant and as , as said the , the , the nineteen thirty three class documents are reissued er which make it very clear that , that middle peasants must be protected .
266119:181	I mean as soon as it 's clear that the middle peasants are coming under pressure December nineteen forty seven , he begins to issue statements , we must protect the middle peasant and as , as said the , the , the nineteen thirty three class documents are reissued er which make it very clear that , that middle peasants must be protected .
266206:25	You 've got to , the peasants have got to be demanding it themselves .
266228:111	So land reform is , is , and this will be very counter to nineteen forty seven , land re land reform is , is not now the means of mobilizing the masses , you have to mobilize the masses for land reform .
266253:7	It has to though because if in the pa if they 've had this long-term sort of culture for all this time they need to be given ideas but essentially if their traditional values were so strong they would have rejected what the Communist Party was trying to say , but because they accepted it it meant they ha they did actually have the potential to be revolutionary .
266311:143	assume that if you give them a population that owned seventy eight percent of the land and find out fifty percent of the land , then you , you know , you ca n't just give land , everyone 's not just gonna have land , you have to increase production to make everyone better off .
266375:139	And this , this other thing as well about erm which is obviously and erm I think what they had in mind was that before you start doing anything radical , before you start having any real land reform at all , you have to ensure that you really have control of that area , he 's had this
266415:9	so you have to actually figure a new one out before we can
266434:36	You do n't have any of this sort of you have to work
266435:40	dates that they had sort of like bonds in which they have to work to supply labour for certain dates on their land instead of feudal ties
266489:79	then the , the main problem is rent because presumably it all , all starts being creamed off the top so , okay you do n't have to redistribute land , but you can still get rid of the landlords and the people who are erm taking away the surplus
266543:12	So we then have to coordinate our policies
266546:113	It 's got , I mean , surely the , the middle peasants or even the rich peasants the group of people that are gonna be most productive in the economy erm so you know your reform has to be fairly moderate in that sense that they have to be able to promote
266546:143	It 's got , I mean , surely the , the middle peasants or even the rich peasants the group of people that are gonna be most productive in the economy erm so you know your reform has to be fairly moderate in that sense that they have to be able to promote
266550:32	So in a very broad sense agriculture is going to have to con contribute to China 's , China as a whole 's economic development
266553:12	So agriculture will have to play a role in that and therefore we want to increase agricultural output and in order to do that you want to protect the middle and rich peasants who are the most efficient producers , or I E managerial farms if , if they are more efficient , you want to , if you want it would not make sense to take land away from rich peasants in order to give to poor peasants when rich peasants might be more efficient producers .
266560:157	Well I mean surely it 's , that 's the point now is to try to make a fair erm law and one that is ideologically erm designed seeing we 've got to power , or we 've got certainty of obtaining power , therefore land ownership has got to be land ownership which has been capitalism Marxist
266592:30	So our , our land reform is going to have to reflect that so you would expect to see elements , perhaps , of socialisms being created .
266595:191	Sh I mean to , to my mind , should n't the land ownership possibly one of the key issues cos that is if you have land ownership and then you 're just paving the way for the new capitalist society and to , you know , according to Marxist theory which I think is a pretty dodgy one , they have to go from capitalism to achieve socialism
266626:36	I mean that 's just rubbish , they said you have to go to
266645:87	I mean th th th th they were on the way to military security , but were they going , they , they , they recognized they had to carry the population with them .
266708:86	This rich peasant economy ought to benefit the population as a whole because it 's increasing production and erm if it becomes more efficient then the rents wo n't have to so high the poor peo poor people benefit .
266847:123	Well perhaps because they were more idealist and that now they 're becoming more realist but they 're still erm I mean they 're learning from their past mistakes and they 've seen that right so we have to have a moderate policy which is gonna take us a little bit further towards socialism .
266864:47	I mean yeah as you say he 's very high personable person , there must be some reason behind it er and a lot of the theoretical reasons that he says of
266880:40	That 's just , that 's just but why does it have to happen ?
266948:165	So , so erm wh which , you know , made me smile and I 'm sure it did everybody else but whenever you were asking a question to Martin you , you started laughing as you were telling it erm and that 's I do n't think that I would actually have to
267000:51	Yeah but you did say on that base oh well you pay tax but obviously you must do as well then
267020:168	Erm you look fairly fit thank you very much , you know , very sweet of you dear , erm tt and I think to , to carry on with the regards to well how much do you earn you went all around the houses , do n't apologize and say well I have to ask you because , you know , , you know you need to know
267027:32	Er and I think that 's all I have to say .
267318:17	Perish the thought you have to be certified to do that .
267554:33	actually move on to the page , you do n't have to go page two , page three , page four oh right John has problems , is that related to
267565:48	I mean I thought you 'd 've made a note about oh I must come back to that later
267574:22	but not necessarily within what we had to do today so .
267691:80	Erm thanks very much for the directions er you gave me , it 's quite awkward coming off the main road there cos you really have to
267695:37	Yeah and was this of your own choosing or did your have to move to this particular area ?
267725:33	Erm it was a mailshot I received oh must be about twelve , thirteen years ago from Friends Provident .
267774:18	now you ha you must 've converted to a unit linked policy by continuing after the period you
267948:48	Erm there are networks throughout the U K and Europe erm for my company and I have to make sure that er all the telecommunication systems are up and running .
268010:21	Yeah I think I 'll have to have a
268110:53	Erm got animals , erm got shops and things are expensive in there , you have to pay to get in , it 's very big and its got aquari aquariums
268410:34	We know that names , we know that all names have to have capital letters .
268426:13	okay I 'll have to give you some paper actually .
268463:54	Now when I said if you halved ten pounds and you get five , what number must go there ?
268514:23	Er well I think I 'll have to show you .
268659:55	That 's it , press when it comes up connect to network press return , we must get beyond connect to network .
268667:75	Yeah , takes you to the end of this menu and we can return to the main menu , and er we wo n't er have to select printer again will we
268742:31	So what we do is erm your your cursor must be in the table somewhere , so you then go up to table , select table , then you 've got to format , border , and grid so we want the grid lines to show then in fact you can chose what we want for the outside border one of these Right , okay Now what I want you to do is set the questions , right ?
268749:34	Yeah , you can choose any decimal , it does n't have to even start with numbers , cos it could start with zero , it does n't , does n't have , does n't have , it does n't have to be bigger than one , it can be smaller than one .
268749:123	Yeah , you can choose any decimal , it does n't have to even start with numbers , cos it could start with zero , it does n't , does n't have , does n't have , it does n't have to be bigger than one , it can be smaller than one .
268769:31	One like that , you see we 'd have to move the point two places to the left , so we 'll have to introduce another zero .
268769:72	One like that , you see we 'd have to move the point two places to the left , so we 'll have to introduce another zero .
269168:7	I had to go to lots of pubs ,
269286:10	I 'll have to go to the library for that .
269299:42	So if you can think about it like laterally but we gonna have to work out an argument
269354:83	So the important thing about this is that you cannot , you cannot just say modern equals bad , and trad is good because you must in order to argue Paul examine the
269358:8	you must examine the context because the situation relies on the
269360:12	No , you must
269364:11	I 'll have to change , I 'll have to change my thingy
269364:29	I 'll have to change , I 'll have to change my thingy
269372:15	Things what I have to set out and like er put bits in
269410:29	No , cos it 's quick if I have to keep your attention
269490:61	If we 're dealing with a front page horror story that 's exactly what your journalist is gonna have to do otherwise his editor says it 's not good enough you know go away , rewrite it and you got shock ' em you gotta make ' em cry and you 're not , not yet
269536:12	you gonna have to insert your pictures do a cut and paste job on the pictures , okay so what have we got here then ?
269688:10	Later it had to be accepted that she would be wheelchair bound for the rest of her life .
269741:23	It will be seen that I have to arrive at figures in respect of damages in this case under a number of heads .
269743:10	To that must be added her loss of earnings throughout her life in her chosen occupation .
269745:11	To this must be added the cost of accommodation in the future , it being accepted on all sides that the plaintiff 's present home , though much loved by her , is not suitable in any long term assessment .
269758:92	As Mr said in an earlier report , brackets B twelve closed brackets quote , Anna Jane is a quick witted intelligent girl and it is obviously extremely frustrating for her to have to type her conversations , unquote .
269760:101	She retains a liveliness of mind which is quite extraordinary under the circumstances and she still displays a keen sense of humour and a warmth of contact despite the fact that she has to use a machine .
269768:27	The plaintiff 's position now is that she has to face the fact that she 's wheelchair bound for life and unable to speak .
269771:9	Her father has to sleep in the same room since he has to attend to her during the night when she may need a bed pan up to four times .
269771:36	Her father has to sleep in the same room since he has to attend to her during the night when she may need a bed pan up to four times .
269775:40	She can drink from a beaker with a lid and straw , but has to have someone with her because of the risk of choking .
269777:10	Her food has to be in sandwich or semi-pureed form for easy swallowing and again to reduce the possibility of choking .
269784:34	It is in the light of these matters that I have to decide upon the appropriate evidence up upon the appropriate figure for pain , suffering and loss of amenity .
269804:7	It must not be forgotten that for this three year period the patient was being cared for in two hospitals and in Hunstead Park by a full range of no doubt dedicated professions .
269847:12	The problems I have to resolve under this heading are not made any easier by uncertainty , even in the short term future , as to who will be doing the caring and at what stages changes to the present regime will take place .
269863:32	It 's on that basis that a whole life multiplier must be found .
269887:135	Autee Lord Justice had this to say at page nine two seven quote , having decided that he , brackets the judge close brackets , could make no allowance for the possibility of increased pension payments because of the increased cost of living index , he had to decide the present day value of the fixed sum payable in thirty one years time .
269901:46	This is a matter of probability but for purposes of actuarial calculation , it has to be treated as a certainty .
269903:11	Any actuarial calculation must therefore be discounted to allow for the chance that he may only live for a shorter period .
269904:32	The chances and not the probabilities are what the judge has to evaluate in any given case .
269907:61	Lord Justice went on , quote , I agree with this indeed when making the calculations the judge had to make , those who die early are the only ones which matter because the fact of living longer than the expectation is immaterial .
269985:12	I know have to give my conclusions to the resolution of that conflicting and often very , very massive evidence as to how the plaintiff 's care routine will change , when it will change and from where the carers will come .
270000:17	It follows that I must translate those conclusions into figures .
270024:12	The plaintiff will have to move as soon as possible to move suitable accommodation which will inevitably be a bungalow .
270045:49	The proper figure per annum is therefore twelve hundred pounds to which a multiplier of has to be applied , making a total of twenty one thousand six hundred pounds .
270063:32	Whilst recognising all her sporting and social successes I also have to recognise that she was not an academic high flyer .
270092:80	As to what would have happened without the event of the accident in her A level year by way of results , I regret I have to find as a fact that she would not in the year of her accident , have achieved the grades necessary for her to take up a place at Norwich City College .
270120:15	To that sum must be added under a different heading of damages , past loss of earnings for the period when she would have entered the catering industry .
270123:52	I consider that she would have found a job by early Autumn and therefore the sum must be more than a , nearly a year 's earnings and I assess it at eight thousand pounds .
270137:10	To that must be added the running costs of a , at a si at a similarly discounted rate deduced from the A A tables of nine p , nine point four eight tenths of a mile .
270161:23	Neither of those sums of course has to be taken into account in any of the mathematics which now have to be done to total up the awards which I would make .
270161:66	Neither of those sums of course has to be taken into account in any of the mathematics which now have to be done to total up the awards which I would make .
270163:13	From this sum there must be deducted a total figure of two hundred and ten thousand seven hundred and seventy eight pounds and ten pence .
270168:54	These figures do not allow any sum for interest and therefore it may be that calculations will have to be made by council to include that figure or alternatively I am informed that both parties wish to consider the possibility of the incorporation of this judgement into a structured settlement .
270171:100	If there is to be a time taken for a further hearing before me in relation to the question of interest and or a structured settlement , I regret that the parties will have to follow me , not purely from Chelmsford to London but thereafter to Maidstone .
270172:52	I am sure that the arrangement can be made and er I conclude what I have to say at this stage .
270177:42	Er , My Lord we will obviously calculate such interest that has to be calculated er and figures have to be sorted out and will be agreed if that is appropriate , er and we 'll also consider whether it 's proper er to seek to achieve a structured settlement .
270177:63	Er , My Lord we will obviously calculate such interest that has to be calculated er and figures have to be sorted out and will be agreed if that is appropriate , er and we 'll also consider whether it 's proper er to seek to achieve a structured settlement .
270271:76	Well that 's since denied by the defendant and that is a factual , major factual dispute which is obviously what you 'll have to decide .
270277:63	If such application was to be made to the court I feel that further references to your business acumen would have to be supplied beforehand .
270353:31	My Lord the er plaintiff 's case is that you must er appertain now the actual situation of these plaintiffs and compare it with the situation that would have prevailed if the breaching of contract alleged , had not occurred .
270365:18	Er , my Lord I have to say that as far as the expert evidence from the accountant is concerned it is only Mr who has er offered an opinion , expressed an opinion upon that issue .
270381:140	The rule i in my submission is that expert evidence is admissible er where there are matters at issue before the court which require expertise for the analysis and these criteria to be satisfied in my submission are that first of all the evidence must be relevant , and secondly the witness must be competent to give it .
270381:162	The rule i in my submission is that expert evidence is admissible er where there are matters at issue before the court which require expertise for the analysis and these criteria to be satisfied in my submission are that first of all the evidence must be relevant , and secondly the witness must be competent to give it .
270393:91	Well my Lord , all we know is that erm when the report was served on the defendant it then came through court they were going to have to call Mr and then last week it was suggested er that er not only did they not agree but that they were going to try to prevent it being admitted in evidence .
270416:7	I must say that I doubt the value as it seems to me become accustomed in cases of this type .
270417:29	It is then the legal duty in any situation must I think the questions for the court , clearly there 's not practice so accepted standards of conduct as laid down by the professional institute .
270450:72	Analysing your opening to me you were saying that there 's expert evidence that solicitors instructed in the purchase of a property must ask about financial arrangements and advise about them .
270451:20	Secondly it is the solicitors must advise about clause twenty two and thirdly well that 's about it really , is n't it .
270477:50	Well why do n't you just adopt their verbiage as part of er wo n't have to pay any copyright fees for doing that .
270509:55	Yes but I ca n't receive expert evidence on that because that 's the very thing I have to decide is n't it ?
270510:140	My Lord it will be helped in that situation in my submission by evidence from which is dealing with what is the accepted and standard practice in that solicitors in handling these forms of transactions and what advice is given my Lord undoubtedly that must be of benefit to the courts .
270512:9	Your Lordship must be helped in that considerably , by that evidence .
270520:75	Well you have n't pleaded a term of the contract that there 's a practice to which all solicitors are subject that they have got to do this that and the other .
270544:55	The er the defence case is that er there was no duty a and in my submission it must be of assistance to your Lordship to determine that issue to hear evidence from both sides upon whether there is such a practice and if there is what the extent of it is .
270564:15	Well my Lord I must say it had occurred to me erm that certainly on the basis on which I 'm contending for damages to be assessed with the plaintiffs and it is completely irrelevant , er er many of the matters to which the defendant 's expert goes to as to the damages and the extent to which they were caused by the negligence of the defendant , the breach of duty .
270642:36	Now in this case the police have the burning proof we have to satisfy you of in particular three things .
270643:29	Firstly as you have probably already gathered , we have to satisfy you that there were reasonable grounds to believe that Lawrence was in the flat , the plaintiff 's flat .
270644:10	Secondly we have to satisfy you that in order to that flat they used only reasonable and necessary force .
270645:12	And thirdly we have to satisfy you that in the circumstances of the operation the police were justified in restraining Mr with handcuffs for the short period of time that he was restrained and in addition Mrs who you will remember was restrained in her lounge , she was told she could n't leave the lounge , again for a few minutes .
270646:33	And members of the jury we do n't that we have to prove that to you .
270674:54	They weighed up the prospect of knocking on the door and members of the jury , you have to consider in due course whether they got that act right .
270677:7	They had to risks did n't they .
270682:176	On the other hand there was the risk which in fact materialised which is that in mounting such an operation they would frighten innocent members of the public it was open to the jury , we do n't swing from the fact that Mrs and her children were clearly frightened , no doubt about that , it must have been a terrifying experience .
270683:29	But those are the two risks the police had to weigh up and what they will tell you is that one risk , a gunman on the loose , is a potential to main and kill , one is far , far more serious than the risk of causing some temporary fear and fright of little children .
270706:82	None of us it is a matter of extreme regret that they were terrified in the way they claim they were , but that sympathy must not be allowed to cloud your judgement on the issue about whether the police were reasonable .
270728:16	Elaine , do I have to give my home address ?
270961:9	So he must have been caught in the meantime and sent back .
271048:111	In my respectful submission there could be A , no question that the jury would be discharged and B , in the submission er some er judicial displeasure of an experienced police officer volunteering what any police officer must know is A inadmissible and B not an answer to the question .
271066:39	When they come to consider the plaintiff 's damages , it must be highly material that they then may say to themselves , however , this would family was harbouring this dangerous criminal two days beforehand .
271072:28	There are other subsidiaries used that do have to go through the jury , particularly what happens in relation to Mrs and the children , as my friend opened it to erm opened it to the er jury .
271088:7	I must just stretch my legs while the jury are coming back alright .
271149:42	But ultimately it is what is the safest option that I would have to go for .
271302:27	Now would you , I think it must be right that you were at the at five fifteen in the morning conducted by Sergeant .
271375:98	Their ability to react to given situations using slide and a film projector images and er a written examination at the er end of it , plus a full classification shoot whereby they have to reach a certain standard erm of ability in order to er pass the two week course .
271414:10	There would have to be changes of shifts , er and the likelihood that the operation to erm , the surveillance operation would be compromised as a result .
271444:29	On on a briefing for an operation do you have to give further recommendation to advise on instructions about the use of guns or is that part and parcel of training ?
271463:161	It is a medical fact that the body is at its lowest ebb between three and six in the morning and the ability to react , the ability to think when one is being woken up in the early hours of the morning erm are a consideration that we take into account when we have to mount an operation inside a premises .
271506:81	Yes members of the jury we will resume at two o' clock , erm because I have other duties later on this afternoon we 'll have to finish at four o' clock today , it may help you to know that , it may help council to know that as well .
271539:22	And er Mr have you ever had to shoot a suspect ?
271566:54	Well obviously the fact that we er are carrying a firearm and that firearm is loaded erm has to be borne in mind at all times .
271567:57	Without over dramatising the fact that firearm , coupled with myself could easily kill somebody so we have to make sure that every single time we draw the weapon er there is a need , there is a justification for it er and as soon as that need and justification stops , so would we put the weapon away .
271582:9	Other methods must have been tried and failed , or must because of the circumstances , be unlikely to succeed if tried .
271582:30	Other methods must have been tried and failed , or must because of the circumstances , be unlikely to succeed if tried .
271587:48	The responsibility for the use of the firearm is an individual decision , which may have to be justified in legal proceedings .
271654:7	I have to say that I know for definite that the force at that time only possessed two shields , er we kept one shield in the South of the county at and one shield North of the county and and hence that is why I went to the headquarters in the morning .
271680:193	Er yes , the door opener in fact was was put on wrongly erm by unfortunately P C and er as the pressure started to exert outwards erm it then found that there was no resistance and consequently all the pressure was being put outwards er and as such then the machine started to to make a noise erm which then we had to switch it off , turn it round , back on again and eventually gained access .
271688:7	We have to work as quickly and as safely as we possibly can and we ca n't afford to spend five minutes er searching a house , let alone a flat .
271689:7	We have to get in as quickly and as quietly a we possibly can and then once in try and secure the place from any possible threat that might be in there .
271803:9	But I have to say that at that time I still did n't know , I had a good idea , that it was n't the man we were looking for but therefore he was still arrested and he was arrested on sus well for harbouring an escapee .
271814:9	Did you have to assist to get his trouser on ?
271881:7	I have to say I have no idea .
271886:8	I have to put it this way but there are n't any alternative .
271894:174	It is right to say that I have heard from Mrs Paul 's classroom assistant during the last academic year , she appears virtually to have acted as an enabler , but she was by no means dedicated to Paul as a one to one enabler and of course the extent of the attention of which she had to give to Paul detracted from her ability to give attention to other pupils .
271903:137	That means five thousand eight hundred and twenty five pounds which one multiplies by four , giving a total under that schedule of twenty three thousand , three hundred pounds , I regret to say that it is of course inherent in the judgment that I have to deliver that there is a good deal of what
271908:49	The advantages and disadvantages of each proposal have been canvassed helpfully by Counsel , I have to say that I prefer the approach of Mrs , she had in my view more experience and more relevant experience than Mrs was able to bring to bear .
271917:126	In so far as the house does represent a large capital asset , and it undoubtedly does , I am quite clear that in the long term , house prices are likely , generally to rise with inflation , indeed I would think must do so or perhaps to rise rather more quickly than inflation if there is a rising population and as there has been for very , very ma many years have passed , that , in the passed a decreasing occupancy rate .
271932:181	In those circumstances it does not seem to me right to leave open , whether the court has power to do so I 'm doubtful , but in any event it does not seem to me right to leave open a question of whether there should be some damages to provide for the possibility that er Paul may have to leave school , nor do I think that it is a situation in which any contingency award should be made in respect of that .
271955:121	my lord various er matters arise under that , we would ask er at this stage erm not for a judgement , two reasons , but for an adjournment , the first reason is the court of protection costs will have to be calculated
271988:114	I 'm rather reluctant to do that because I have absolutely no basis for knowing how long negotiations of this sort are likely to take , erm and if I say well er that such negotiations must be completed by
272017:41	I 'm sorry for the five minute delay most of you , I had to seek out about a administrative matter , an administrative matter , nothing to do with the evidence or the place for Mr you had told us earlier in the week about several situations , as the management company .
272154:14	Mr but you must have therefore suggested it to them then that er the service charges needed to be updated once a year
272191:76	yes I , I would suggest that I , I do n't know the particular individual who put the words together , but you would have to ask Mr the marketing director for that information
272207:94	oh , we do n't want to lose him before explore it , of course do explore it with him , that 's what he said you 'll have to ask Mr about it
272210:14	but what you have to do with it is the compilation of the figures that go into the little table under so what would it cost , those are your figures are n't they ?
272352:142	erm , I understand that they might trade down , but equally there are a number and I can take you to the letters written to the if you like , are you saying you did n't realize that many of these people would have to budget , carefully budget
272588:52	so it meant that for some time before contingency fund development was introduced you must of had some concerns er about the accuracy of the figures you were putting forward for the publication , can , can I explain that a little more ? if after a few years a major repair needs to be carried out there was no contingency fund , it might mean sticking another two or three hundred pounds a year on the service charges , might it not , to cover a major repair
272602:45	I see let take it from the other end , why did you have to take the insertion of the contingency fund of the estimates
272696:16	exactly , but who has to pay in to the contingency fund if it 's agreed by the residence ?
272697:9	the residence have to pay
272698:27	so their charges would go up if you had to have a contingency fund ?
272732:35	you insurance them centrally as it were and each resident has to pay part of the insurance cost ?
272858:22	and in the end the jury will have to say which of the two versions of the meaning they except
272867:128	er one that occurs to me , no , no speaking on it myself , the jury might be interested , sometime I just like to get a feel of what a brochure looks like , not divided as it obviously has to be here , could , could we see a couple sometime , not , not now
272944:16	I know , I must see , you think or Mr can go on , right let 's have Mr
273018:44	The wording referring to the specific location in the location description would by definition have to be drawn up the region , cos they would have intimate knowledge of the locality that er sorry and the costs would be drawn up by the region because they would know as I say intimately they would know that specific development
273058:17	I think it must of been , it had to be on a Saturday I believe
273058:31	I think it must of been , it had to be on a Saturday I believe
273065:13	did you yourself have to do anything follow the art following the article ?
273185:106	Well , I think sometimes , I , at at home , erm , if I 'm , particularly if I 'm typing , I like music , and if the phone goes , people must wonder what on earth it is , because there 's music going on somewhere , which they obviously can hear in the background , but I like , I like that as a background .
273228:10	I just had to say that is beautiful and I wish I had more words to describe it , but I have n't yet .
273290:21	Erm , it re , it must , again , be a matter where er a scientist can become very enthusiastic and almost read into the results , what he expects to find there .
273345:105	But a doctor , one of the doctors in the same hospital saying , that the , during the First World War , when they were so desperate , you know , so many casualties , they had to cut short treatment , and they had to bandage men up and leave them bandaged up a long length of , they found it was often better to leave a wound bandaged up in it 's own
273345:130	But a doctor , one of the doctors in the same hospital saying , that the , during the First World War , when they were so desperate , you know , so many casualties , they had to cut short treatment , and they had to bandage men up and leave them bandaged up a long length of , they found it was often better to leave a wound bandaged up in it 's own
273381:20	Er , but that , there must have been enormous pressure on the scientist working in those great laboratories
273385:12	Yes , er must must be enormous pressure exercised there .
273385:15	Yes , er must must be enormous pressure exercised there .
273390:8	It has to be , it has to be rushed
273390:23	It has to be , it has to be rushed
273393:22	Must be a risk , they must know there is a risk , must n't they .
273393:43	Must be a risk , they must know there is a risk , must n't they .
273398:44	Yeah , yes , but there there 's gotta come a time when they have to test it on human beings .
273404:22	And erm , they they they must try them on human beings , and I 'm sure there are some people who are quite prepared to these tried .
273406:11	' Cos there must be a great deal of pressure on the scientific erm er , problem was there and try and find
273408:74	That that again , if you if you were able to say that 's gonna happen , that will that will that must be given priority , but there 's no guarantee they can find it .
273454:9	His mind must act as a filter .
273498:22	how much more you would have had to pay .
273602:11	If you have to acquire it as a new one , it 's
273609:9	I have to stop and think , and I have to work out that four hundred millilitres is not quite five hundred millilitres , so it 's about , but I 'm not sure how about a pou a pint .
273609:33	I have to stop and think , and I have to work out that four hundred millilitres is not quite five hundred millilitres , so it 's about , but I 'm not sure how about a pou a pint .
273619:23	Oh , wait a minute , it must be , because erm ,
273633:10	And I had to do conversions on thousands of pounds and litres and gallons , I was working from a con
273691:16	Or whether you 've had to wait for an hour in the rain for the bus to come along , whether you 're in a good mood or a bad mood .
273741:60	Yes , yes , well some of my , some of my best friends are sociologists , so I must be careful .
273765:47	But it it would be interesting to know what sort of a background you have to have , in order to have a degree in sociology .
273783:143	Th th the trouble is the government seems to go the other way , and er , when when it should be learning my opinion , lowering the age at which you receive your pension , they want to extend the age into which you have to work .
273793:119	There was a time , I 'm sure , a few years ago , when you could have said , can you spare us an afternoon , they would have been only too pleased , but now , they might have to say , well , you know , two hours of my time , that 's that 's the university and you know , there are the overheads , and
273809:61	I 'm sure we can get an accountant to come and speak to us , but we might have to pay him for two hours work , you see .
273811:17	And that , you 'll have to take out a mortgage to do that .
273823:36	If experimental methods are to be used , then some theory must already be present .
273870:19	Erm , so er , there must have been a situation where he was discovered , that it was possible to split the atom , basically .
273897:51	Erm , that that that that is a point where the discovery in itself , must have given a great deal of pleasure to a a er a number of people who 've been involved in the , in the research .
273935:52	Well , they ca n't look , they do n't but what according to and therefore they have to throw a high percentage of the results ,
273965:137	Thumbed through some papers that they have got , in front of the shop , and found one set of erm , papers from nineteen thirty-six concerned the French National Anthem , and I thought that was a second amazing coincidence , er , and so I had to buy myself that that set of papers for about a pound .
273994:52	Well , I think that started in the black-out , you know , because , we had to , if the sirens went , you know , we had to stop in the
273994:88	Well , I think that started in the black-out , you know , because , we had to , if the sirens went , you know , we had to stop in the
274051:12	You 'd practically have to run to keep up with with some of them .
274065:26	And the , as I say , it must have been difficult to go through a day , between nineteen thirty-nine , and nineteen forty-five without hearing the National Anthem somewhere , somehow .
274102:15	I think we have to remember that that that these Anthems are all played by the same military band , and therefore they 're played in a western style .
274113:9	Storms must pass , Sun will shine , Slovaks shall waken .
274114:32	So it , it was , I suppose we have to say in the past tense , it was , the National Anthem of Czechoslovakia .
274189:17	Erm , Dietrich the Mayor had to flee the country .
274214:14	I think you have to remember that the next line begins , If , so it 's not just a pro it is , it is a nationalistic song , but it 's not just a proclamation that they will be , erm ,
274294:13	Oh , we had to wait at the border , we had in advance to get visas , and when we got there , things were very simple but nonetheless , we were very well received , and the person that I was staying with , lived in a flat , a very simple flat , but nonetheless , a very pleasant flat .
274301:7	It must eventually be split up into , the Muslims , the Serbs , the Croats , and that , that is in fact very sad .
274314:22	we knew that , and we had to sing it in French .
274487:108	Now you think that because I am I am forgiven and I preach forgiveness that I would be pretty good as up people , but that 's part of my human failure and I must admit that I 've given plenty of opportunity to practice at home and at work er the opportunity to forgive , but it does n't come easily and certainly it is n't a strong feature of the non-Christian world in which I work and which you will be working soon .
274526:32	I 'll be interested to hear what the teachers have to think about that and like you .
274529:27	all sorts of managing business and they had to work together and to hold group organisations .
274530:98	The person whom I was going to take over the job from said to me at the end of the meeting well what do you think of that meeting and I must admit I the answer and luckily somebody else instructed with some other business and I felt I got off the hook here but in fact that got dealt with very quickly and he came back to me and said well what did you think of the meeting and I had to say to him just one word , was the way I put it .
274530:249	The person whom I was going to take over the job from said to me at the end of the meeting well what do you think of that meeting and I must admit I the answer and luckily somebody else instructed with some other business and I felt I got off the hook here but in fact that got dealt with very quickly and he came back to me and said well what did you think of the meeting and I had to say to him just one word , was the way I put it .
274533:13	and then I had to work with these people and I knew that that was the kind of way that they were operating and I had to teach them by the way I worked but in fact it was okay to admit that we do make mistakes .
274533:84	and then I had to work with these people and I knew that that was the kind of way that they were operating and I had to teach them by the way I worked but in fact it was okay to admit that we do make mistakes .
274534:7	We have to admit that each one of us could fail in what we were supposed to be doing and in fact then we could work together , that we could forgive each other and that we could support each other in our work .
274550:10	You also have to think of the effect it has on other people , how er if you just let people get away with it , it does n't mean you hate them , loathe them and damn them but er you 've got to make them realise that for other people , for everybody .
274634:15	No you do n't have to write the answers , I 'll just ask them you orally .
274673:43	Now which other four do you think were the key if you had to pick out six major ones , yeah .
274757:16	Well then my parents would have to accept it would n't they , they would have to have face face face up to the fact that I was n't already married .
274757:46	Well then my parents would have to accept it would n't they , they would have to have face face face up to the fact that I was n't already married .
274783:56	Well Romeo was although he wanted to keep the peace , he was a chicken so I had to stick up for him cos I don I do n't like people doing that to my friends .
274858:48	If you did n't all want to go , you know you do n't have to go , but then I could just take maybe ten or fifteen of you , but how many will be interested in going to the one in the summer in this lovely out-door theatre ?
274899:11	The decisions that have to be made generally speaking .
274906:46	You ca n't all be company directors , some of us are gonna have to be shop floor workers are n't we .
274986:152	We need to understand the position of the Sanhedrin , Jesus is really representing great changes in their tradition great a great revolution really and we know that what he was doing was was sort of getting Christianity to grow out of Judaism , but it meant that Judaism had to move to one side .
275018:93	Go and see the reaction of the people who witnessed him cure the blind man Blind Bartiamaus or Bethsiedum Go and check out what the woman who with a haemorrhage had to say about him .
275020:12	Now Saint Marcus had to put all that lot together to make it look right and make it make sense , with hindsight , bringing all the important pieces together .
275025:9	But Mark has to put all the package together .
275084:17	Why did n't the Romans have to do it ?
275197:114	These are the affirmations that were being made as Jesus trotted in Jerusalem with this little donkey , his followers gathered all around him looking from the heights of the walls of Jerusalem , there must have been one or two curious , astonished , worried eyes , the Sanhedrin , the Chief Elders ,
275210:171	This was where Jesus was going , because he knew that to take to take something over and let 's face it Jesus was looking to take over take something over to fulfil something and he was hoping to fulfil Judaism to take it over , to fulfil it , he had to go to where it mattered .
275242:25	And number four , if you had to have two or three images to this collage , what would you choose and why ?
275345:7	you have to kill the animal
275370:125	Erm it has been suggested I think Naomi 's saying on this side of the room that if there is an element of bad taste because the baby is chained up or whatever and it 's in er has had to be placed in an undignified or uncomfortable position in order to be photographed and Naomi 's question .
275492:14	Richard do you have to make those noises ?
275664:14	And what you have to , what actually happens , you have what is known as an offer price , and a bid price .
275705:12	I do n't have to get do I ?
275707:12	I do n't have to make the decisions .
275712:9	So we must be getting round to Sue 's question .
275772:64	If I wanted to pay annually would I still get fifty thousand pounds worth of cover , or would I have to pay two hundred and forty pounds per year ?
275789:107	Right , so , if it was going to cost me twenty pound a month for fifty thousand pounds worth of life cover , and I wanted to pay it annually , I 'd have to pay it twelve times , I 'd have to pay two hundred and forty pounds .
275789:137	Right , so , if it was going to cost me twenty pound a month for fifty thousand pounds worth of life cover , and I wanted to pay it annually , I 'd have to pay it twelve times , I 'd have to pay two hundred and forty pounds .
275813:9	So it must be Andrew , your question , alright .
275821:12	So , we must be , are we back with you David , or with you Sue ?
275877:12	Yes , it must be yours , Sue or something .
275889:84	After that the total amounts , or even a bit more if we look at it , erm , what over factor , Janet , no John , it must be John 's turn now , affects the allocation to units in those first four years by looking at that table .
275930:36	Erm , and I 've just asked John , so I must be now with , no I 've just asked Kim , so I must be now with Philip .
275930:76	Erm , and I 've just asked John , so I must be now with , no I 've just asked Kim , so I must be now with Philip .
275968:14	Seven percent , you have to add them together .
275969:7	You have to add the cost of waiver on a joint life policy , you have to add , add the costs together .
275969:50	You have to add the cost of waiver on a joint life policy , you have to add , add the costs together .
275974:20	Erm , so the next question must come to , to John , or is it Kim , it must be Andrew .
275974:60	Erm , so the next question must come to , to John , or is it Kim , it must be Andrew .
275975:7	It must be Andrew , right .
275982:9	So we must move on to Philip , no ?
275984:14	Not again , it must be John then , John ?
276027:32	Erm , we 've just asked John so we must be now with Kim , are we ?
276090:43	Erm , reviews , reviews , we 're up , Sue , so it must be ,
276156:63	Yes , he can continue at that level of a hundred and ninety but he 's obviously going to have to pay more , because he 's only paid for it for ten years , or he can reduce it down to the original amount .
276184:38	They can increase their plan further , what effect would that actually have to the plan though ?
276201:12	Er , we must now be with Andrew .
276213:34	Erm , right , oh , er , John , it must be , must be John , because er , must be David , yes .
276213:42	Erm , right , oh , er , John , it must be , must be John , because er , must be David , yes .
276213:62	Erm , right , oh , er , John , it must be , must be John , because er , must be David , yes .
276221:7	It must be definitely a point off for racism here .
276236:22	Erm , at what age must the selected period finish , Philip ?
276237:36	It starts a minimum of ten years , but what age must it always finish by ?
276271:14	Er , the company has to review
276309:57	You can advise them whether they decide your advice that 's fine , but what you must do is get them to s , you must write it on the plan your future document , the advice you gave , what plan you decided to do , and I would actually get him to initial it as well .
276309:84	You can advise them whether they decide your advice that 's fine , but what you must do is get them to s , you must write it on the plan your future document , the advice you gave , what plan you decided to do , and I would actually get him to initial it as well .
276312:12	So we now must be with John .
276423:61	The bid price is what the company will give the client , and the offer price is which the client has to buy off the company .
276544:121	He said that , you 're just , he , he , he said that it 's available to housewives but only if they erm , will be going back to work prior to the claim , but you must be employed prior to the claim .
276556:45	O K , well done , so we 've had two bonuses , so that must give you eight marks which makes you forty one .
276564:57	Then if it 's not going to be taken up on one of those five years , you have to leave that payment , you lose it .
276596:7	You have to have the same proportion next time .
276642:67	Erm , if it 's paid up you can start paying again at some point in the future , but you have to pay an extra one-off charge , to do it , I think .
276647:42	Erm , you ca n't choose to make it paid up , it has to be paid up because the premiums are n't being paid .
276655:25	O K , erm , and you do have to actually pay back the premiums other people would stop and start them at random .
276696:42	Can you imagine , you know a teacher , I thought I had to tell them every minute detail of these plans .
276704:61	I mean can you imagine people stopping their friends outside the D I Y store and saying you must buy one of these bits , it 's absolutely superb , look at the metal , look at the shape , it 's absolutely wonderful .
276738:10	But you have to think about it and it comes with practice , which as you obviously sell more and more of these plans , most of which have got waiver of premium .
276860:17	Er , and I 'd have to start thinking about where I am again .
276868:20	Good , so John it must be your turn now , so you can select anybody else in the room , and go through the same process .
276917:9	So we have to keep ahead of that , because we 're planning the benefits for you , twenty or twenty five years ' time .
276918:9	So we have to make sure the money you pay to us , actually is going to grow so it gives you a very good return on that money in twenty five years ' time .
276927:7	I must have had a death wish choosing that .
276998:15	Erm , you could have got to the close a little bit earlier , but then it , I think you were just finding your words , that was good , well done .
277026:16	So Sue , it must be you , to
277038:27	Well presented , well personalised , did they have to finish it ?
277074:97	He was talking at the Life Assurance Association er , convention in London I think it 's er , three year ago now , in er , nineteen ninety , it must be ninety one , because I went on a course then .
277082:9	Do I have to things to talk about it ,
277086:7	You have to listen quite carefully .
277197:53	Sam says before he had his heart attacks , he had five six , I 'll have to change the story .
277199:57	Sam says before he had his heart attacks , he had five , six , I 'll have to change the story , he has a heart transplant , he developed diabetes , and he 's later amputated .
277237:7	I had to investigate her , and I diagnosed that she had cancer of the lungs .
277242:11	That little girl had to struggle on because the flat rent had to be paid , she had to struggle on because she had a car , kids had to go to school , until she died .
277242:35	That little girl had to struggle on because the flat rent had to be paid , she had to struggle on because she had a car , kids had to go to school , until she died .
277242:55	That little girl had to struggle on because the flat rent had to be paid , she had to struggle on because she had a car , kids had to go to school , until she died .
277242:89	That little girl had to struggle on because the flat rent had to be paid , she had to struggle on because she had a car , kids had to go to school , until she died .
277259:35	His whole family is locked into caring , working wives have to give up work to come and help them .
277264:12	You never have to tell a person who 's had a heart attack , you never need to tell a woman when her husband has a stroke , I have to .
277264:92	You never have to tell a person who 's had a heart attack , you never need to tell a woman when her husband has a stroke , I have to .
277270:7	You must watch our statistics .
277296:93	It seems that it is not clarification of definition , tell that to the woman who looked for two , thirteen years after a stroke husband and they had to wait for his death , that you did n't sell him a dread disease policy because there is not clarification of definition .
277336:56	It 's only a very short walk down , if you walk through the shops you do n't have to go all the way down , you can actually come , just walk past that shop and go down the middle , and you come out through the car park .
277364:18	I would think there must be a large part of people out there that could benefit from their estates is n't there ?
277385:15	I mean we must all know somebody who 's had a heart attack , a stroke , cancer etcetera , etcetera .
277426:12	You do n't have to die .
277441:9	So you have to sort of look carefully .
277478:12	It does n't have to be one that 's issued .
277569:12	Er , there must be a worry in a lot of people , single people 's minds what happens to me when I get older and in ill-health , how will I cope ?
277594:24	The first life , well it does n't have to be the man , but if , if you write the application so
277749:15	Now you do n't have to rely on this , because you can ring through to head office in the evening , or you can ring through your branch while that 's open , and get a computer quote over the phone , but actually find it quite useful if somebody asks me to be able to give them an idea of how much it 's going to cost them .
277763:42	However , that is n't the end of the sum because you do have to add a policy fee , and we 're not talking expense charge here , of one pound nineteen , we are talking a number which has been devised so that you get right answer from the rate book .
277800:35	It 's below the minimum premium , so what will he have to pay ?
277849:54	Fifteen years , is three pound eighty , yes , so , you , I think you must have gone down , yes you went down to the level one , yes ?
277883:20	The first thing you 'd have to do , is take off the policy fee .
278023:16	What you will have to do though , is work out the cost of the premiums , that will give you the practice with the rate books .
278123:49	No , no , because passed it over to us that 's why I had to go and see the guy if you remember
278134:7	We have to define ours separately
278183:41	Yeah , if if there 's no-one covering that area then I have to make arrangements for that to be covered which I I will do and that will be .
278205:15	you see we have to be a bit careful because what happens if we closed down right and transferred out to the field
278206:11	And then we have to change our structure
278207:10	Then we have to change again and that 's what you 're saying we have to be a chameleon
278207:51	Then we have to change again and that 's what you 're saying we have to be a chameleon
278208:17	Oh yeah , we 'd have to adapt to the situation we find ourselves with
278213:29	But I do n't think that means we have to adjust our sales structure to them it may mean that we have to look at theirs and decide who 's gonna deal with what , but th but we do n't have to gear all our structure
278213:71	But I do n't think that means we have to adjust our sales structure to them it may mean that we have to look at theirs and decide who 's gonna deal with what , but th but we do n't have to gear all our structure
278213:133	But I do n't think that means we have to adjust our sales structure to them it may mean that we have to look at theirs and decide who 's gonna deal with what , but th but we do n't have to gear all our structure
278262:48	then you argue the toss amongst yourselves really , but you 've got , you have to
278265:12	No but we have to look at what , what 's a workable solution
278269:7	It must be in your tray cos I 've only just got that today .
278338:98	then it 's a national account , but in terms of the guy not seeing anybody we went to him to sort out what was going on and she must have come away there from with all the sites and said I should n't be dealing with this , it 's a national account , it 's the national account and that 's when I said you must pass it over to then
278338:210	then it 's a national account , but in terms of the guy not seeing anybody we went to him to sort out what was going on and she must have come away there from with all the sites and said I should n't be dealing with this , it 's a national account , it 's the national account and that 's when I said you must pass it over to then
278373:57	If we get first division people I 'll do it a different way to him if I had to end up with second division people and the responsibilities they take on board will very much reflect that and the same surely should happen to the field sales force erm their abilities are reflected in in what sort of activities we give them and by looking at the people we have we then put together a team to most accurately attack whatever we want to do .
278401:12	Yeah , I must admit
278402:16	I mean , I must admit I was talking to beforehand and not clear not sure on certain things .
278416:18	I think we 'll have to take a person internally
278448:42	And then if we get agreement on a salary increase then we only have to pay it to one person
278545:16	You see , I must admit you see not I do n't gonna do as good a job as
278570:82	so I mean she 's , she 's she 's and I said to her when when all the things were going wrong with I had to have a lot of chats with her and said well you you 've got to prove that you can rebound from this
278616:21	I think the thing you have to say that as far as I 'm concerned , from what I 've see of her so far and I have n't worked with her in the field yet but far brighter spark in your department than that one we interviewed the other day
278645:10	Well we have to be we have to be because erm
278645:24	Well we have to be we have to be because erm
278685:7	We have to come to an arbitrary decision and then justify it
278698:151	Europe ? well we could beat about the bush but there 's not a single rep on the road that ever gets out the office so gotta win it cos I actually saw I actually we I actually saw her go out and see a customer so she must she must be er
278698:158	Europe ? well we could beat about the bush but there 's not a single rep on the road that ever gets out the office so gotta win it cos I actually saw I actually we I actually saw her go out and see a customer so she must she must be er
278749:48	Er I did bring it with me to give to but obviously I 'll have to send it now .
278769:89	Well to be quite honest I think the reason she wanted it in Norwich was cos Glasgow 're over-loaded as it was I think and they had to learn new skills and staff support and therefore it might not be a good idea to have them as well
278832:27	Oh when we travel with other airlines you must abide by the specific code of dress .
278954:21	Erm but what we will have to do is set up our local procedures as regards agents queries and things like that in both countries , both with and also whatever you decide in Denmark of how we run the procedure but that can be something later but what we 'll need to do is no doubt before we actually do the distribution to the agents and the erm the information out to them th why we 're going into on our own as opposed to being served by the other carriers .
278983:126	It says this is the only number you want but as read it and said well it does n't really make it clear it 's for reservations and bookings and it does n't really so we 'll just have to make sure that it damn well happens on the advert .
279011:23	I do n't know you 'll have to
279049:54	Ah just a couple of people that 's all two people and er they 'll just have to get round it somehow but we do n't yeah well you speak to him right yeah well they can have they can have what they want but I mean it might be just a short term thing .
279063:270	Have a nice weekend , keep on taking the pills yeah well you know what it 's like y' know there 'll be so many people dying for this to fail well they do n't know what 's going on but but all they 'll get is one call interception which says I ca n't get through I ca n't get through , or I 've tried this number and it does n't work and blah you know usual thing but right I must keep on taking the Buffalo Bills .
279105:65	As you can see the erm , where is it , we 've got to have , or the airlines have got to have their submissions in by the end of this month so if we have got anything really that we want to say from sales we ought to be letting have it in in a formal thing .
279218:7	Well has got to have something to do has n't he ? to justify his job because I mean he 's talked to in the past , he 's talked about everything .
279250:23	They said oh well we 'll have to look at that you know
279367:13	Well he 'd have to process his direct like the two for one voucher or something like that
279467:176	I said I said cos you do n't know but she 's a n she 's a nice girl , she looks alright in uniform , she 's not very bright but she 's brighter than some of the ones you 've got er give her a meet and greet job where she just has to smile and point people in the general direction of the bogs and things like that , er , I said and she 'll be alright
279497:10	We 'll have to watch one 's sickness the week away
279509:7	It must there must be it must be possible to speak to her about the fact that she 's not communicating .
279509:14	It must there must be it must be possible to speak to her about the fact that she 's not communicating .
279509:25	It must there must be it must be possible to speak to her about the fact that she 's not communicating .
279559:55	not ideal so we say to you it 's not ideal so the supervisor , so you have to say to , this has gotta be sorted , this is not ideal , this is n't gonna work when you 're not here .
279560:40	If she then requires your help or whatever then that it has to go from there .
279573:15	No but they 'll have to then wo n't they ?
279575:10	They 'd have to talk about things .
279588:23	but y I ca n't I have to say and I know right ca n't give her what she wants is somebody to sit down somebody to sit her down and talk to her and you ca n't give her the benefit of that because it 's a little battle right between the two silly little girls if you like and if that j if that happens had won right and that 's the way will feel it
279604:37	yeah but she 's one of the best typists I have to say .
279642:50	yeah but that 's that 's fair enough but that does n't mean we have to er
279711:51	alright then , fair enough I I I yeah I agree I ca n't I have to buy that one
279764:12	Right , I must get some literature actually from Barry because as you know , it , it , we ca n't get it all out of the now ,
279810:60	They took it remarkably well really , but er , I think there needs to be soft There must be have contingency , because Anne 'd go up the wall over that .
279981:38	If if you would like to reply , you do n't have to reply Mrs it 's up to you .
280046:7	I must say in that sense , thank you Mr for your question , because it 's an an issue that 's conc should concern every member of this authority .
280049:7	I must say that I am happy to make that statement and in view of some of the things that have been , that have appeared in the media recently here 's a statement that needs to be made as for your your your ques , what the , the Chief Constable I welcome the statement and the actions of the Chief Constable on this very concerning issue .
280085:25	It 's a shame also that we have to fill the council chamber on such a debate .
280094:109	We set standards , standards evolve we are coming to the stage now in nineteen ninety three the standards that are being set are changing and at the end of the day the hunt have got to come along with us .
280100:83	I want to thank also er the different organisations , cos you made an absolute profit for the G P O , er erm British Telecom , they must have actually made a bomb in Leicestershire over the last few days .
280106:28	So why is it important that the kill has to continue .
280170:8	They have to buy and sell their produce in that community and there are restrictions operating on that .
280171:18	So I think we must today level out the rules on this and we must speak for what is the majority of opinion in this country , by every single opinion poll that 's been conducted , and that is Chairman to vote to ban fox hunting on our land .
280171:50	So I think we must today level out the rules on this and we must speak for what is the majority of opinion in this country , by every single opinion poll that 's been conducted , and that is Chairman to vote to ban fox hunting on our land .
280198:115	I find this a little strange since he was quite happy to support us when my colleague and I said that there was a greater good to be considered and that people had issues that had to be raised in that area above and beyond the local community .
280210:157	From my point of view , one of the most powerful arguments that needs to be addressed is the argument about individual freedom and this is always important to me about , if you 're going to take an action that limits somebody 's freedom , you damn well have to have a good reason for it .
280240:20	Surely , in this country we have to obey the laws that are there , not the laws that are going some day to be passed .
280255:110	I 'm interested , thank you , I 'm interested to notice that this nineteenth century attitude is being repeated now by er , our friends over there in the Labour party , erm and I must say , that really confirm what I 've always thought that a lot of their attitudes and their mental furniture do in fact belong to that century .
280261:26	I 've heard what 's Mr has to say .
280277:150	Can I also say really I agree with Martin when he said erm , and has been saying for at least six months that surely we have more important things to , to talk about than , than this and I 'm sorry for Martin that he had to erm , give in really and put this I was the movement of the amendment in January ninety two erm , which confirmed that the rights of tenants and old occupiers of land in county council ownership to er allow or stop fox hunting over land in their care .
280282:23	They , they know what they have to do to protect that stock , to protect their life 's interests and they , and they know they do n't need to be told really by any officer here who are not in that not , not in that game , what they have to do that 's what they 're asking us to do and they certainly asked us to do that on the erm , on the tour of county farms that we had only , only a few weeks ago .
280282:162	They , they know what they have to do to protect that stock , to protect their life 's interests and they , and they know they do n't need to be told really by any officer here who are not in that not , not in that game , what they have to do that 's what they 're asking us to do and they certainly asked us to do that on the erm , on the tour of county farms that we had only , only a few weeks ago .
280283:15	I think we have to try and keep this in in proportion , we are really into a we are really into a gesture here an important gesture possibly , but nothing is going to change overnight and in fact very little will happen erm , for years , for years to come .
280306:39	About the only decent argument I 've heard on this , I have to say that because it was my daughter who advanced it , about the only decent argument I have heard is the one about badger baiting where she said to me but badger baiting is not allowed on your land and that is the point precisely that Mr made , it is not allowed because that is the law of the land and that is where decisions about the permission or otherwise of fox hunting should be made .
280347:64	The fact is that any so called sport which involves the exhaustion , distress and eventual death of an animal has got to be obscene in the eyes of any human being .
280379:14	The county council tenant must be left to manage his business and land as he sees fit and this includes his individual conscious decision as to whether to allow fox hunting across his land .
280393:14	They do n't have to hunt foxes to do that the motion , the main motion not the amendment suggests drag hunting er they could , there there my , I think it means proper drag hunting not one er to previously er l l laid out er objectives er they could race each other , they can have treasure hunts , er there are plenty of ways in which they could enjoy riding .
280396:187	Mr Chairman , if decent people find it necessary er to kill animals they believe be vermin they do n't dress up in red coats and call them pink and er charge er , er , er , about er drinking st stirrup cups and tooting horns , er they go out and kill the vermin , it 's a necessary job that has to be done and of course , er there are many ways in which foxes could be killed without cruelty if it is necessary to kill them .
280429:32	Chairman as a former supporter of fox hounds I have to say I am no longer a supporter of fox hounds , I would see the law of this land used to ban hunting with hounds and I support the motion .
280440:40	All be it a tenant , whether or no a tenant farmer must have the privilege of deciding who is invited onto his farm .
280482:101	That of course will go and what 's more there 's going to be some drag hunting on his land of which he will not be consulted because if you had to negotiate with organisations for controlled access to its land for the use of drag hunting .
280572:29	it can be read whenever it does n't have to be read as soon as it 's rel received .
280573:124	You can make sure you can take time to make sure you get it right you get the information right gives you chance to formulate new ideas and put things in a different way until they have to be too many drafts .
280575:16	Complicated when it has to be written down to or detailed where there 's a lot of information to be taken in and it 's a lot easier if it 's done that way because people can refer back to it all the time .
280599:83	erm , and with agencies like Inland Revenue and Customs and Excise so a lot of the stuff we get in is written and we have to reply
280739:37	remember what we said the first thing to date you have to understand what you 're trying to do
280887:49	done it I do n't think it comes naturally either I mean you have to work at it do n't you ?
280894:71	okay you find it hard you find it hard to do to make a special effort what is it you have to make a special effort to do ?
280925:12	You do n't have to be aggressive to be assertive , look at some of these comments we 've got here how confident you are in yourself and how you put your point across .
280927:12	I do n't have to shout I do n't have to be aggressive or intimidate people I just have to tell people what I feel , think etc .
280927:31	I do n't have to shout I do n't have to be aggressive or intimidate people I just have to tell people what I feel , think etc .
280927:61	I do n't have to shout I do n't have to be aggressive or intimidate people I just have to tell people what I feel , think etc .
280947:154	Assertion you 're clear about what you want , you ca n't there 's no need to get get up about it there 's no need to worry about it this is what you want and this is the way it is , you do n't have to shout , you just have to stick to your point .
280947:174	Assertion you 're clear about what you want , you ca n't there 's no need to get get up about it there 's no need to worry about it this is what you want and this is the way it is , you do n't have to shout , you just have to stick to your point .
280954:109	Stick to the point , even if it means you 're acting like a bit of a broken record , get that person make sure they hear what you 're saying even if you have to repeat it over and over again .
281037:12	You do n't have to be win lose all the time , because otherwise you 're gonna have a battle .
281146:182	And I mean I put an asterisk down there to say that 's what I thought was going to come out quite heavily simply because this is is the case on these courses , you know the people that we get on these courses every single one of these that we 've had , and we must have had coming up to what over ten now , every single one we 've had people that the most the majority of people have had team work very high on the score .
281147:66	I wonder if it 's something to do with the job that you do or the people you have to work with I do n't know but that 's generally the tendency of people in these groups , team workers come out quite highly .
281206:17	the group you do n't have to be an expert on something to contribute to the group .
281211:56	Plant , we 'll you 've got to have your crea creativity from somewhere your ideas have got to come from somewhere that 's the plant .
281212:36	Resource investigators the information the group needs to work on has got to come from outside somewhere and resource investigators bring it in .
281215:39	Completer finishes finishers because at the end of the day that job has got to be finished off .
281278:30	Is n't it obvious within a second that you must be looking at the husband and wife ?
281279:7	I have to say again I 'm sorry no it it was n't obvious to me at that time definitely not .
281281:7	I have to say that yes .
281326:9	I have to say now in at this moment in time , I ca n't remember why I did it , but it was an operational decision that was made en route to the flats that we swopped shotguns with er another officer .
281335:7	I have to say I 'm afraid I ca n't erm I have thought about this yes .
281336:113	Because the the nettle I 'm grasping is this ah it is said by the , both of them , that it was you who had what they call a long barrelled gun , it must be a shotgun .
281364:19	Yes but forgive me you must listen to what 's said to you because somebody might be saying to you Lawrence is under the bed .
281375:16	And er again I have to put to you I you 've heard the say and I do think you 'll disagree .
281388:22	Again something that I just have to put .
281390:8	I have to say that it was me , I did that .
281425:34	I remember absolutely one hundred percent doing that , and I have to say that if I was faced with a similar situation again of a naked man , I really do n't know if I 'd bother to put his trousers on .
281572:189	I ca n't exactly remember which side of of the person on the who was lying on the ground , P C was but he was in a position where he was not putting himself er he was covering the person lying on the ground but he was n't covering to the point of fact that P C erm would have to walk in front of his shot gun .
281576:10	He obviously had to get him up f erm sort of rolled him over er one way then the other to be of but the er the legs of the jeans on .
281781:19	The only other thing I have to put to you is this that I 've already put to er what we allege went on in that bedroom .
281860:7	I had to erm until the whole of the h the premises had been searched and secured then I had to assume that there was someone in that room until the contrary was shown .
281860:64	I had to erm until the whole of the h the premises had been searched and secured then I had to assume that there was someone in that room until the contrary was shown .
282059:10	Now it must have been must n't it , a possibility , if been there at all , that he was hiding under that bed ?
282059:19	Now it must have been must n't it , a possibility , if been there at all , that he was hiding under that bed ?
282073:19	But then at some stage he had to move out from behind me to get the bed up .
282094:13	He would have had to have reached out .
282095:26	So he well I knew he 'd have to reach out
282102:89	Constable when he was giving evidence it only takes a second to fire a gun was n't that the reason that the bed was tipped because it had to be checked quickly that was n't underneath otherwise Constable may might have got shot .
282117:22	But I 'm afraid that I must ride , because I 'm not at my next appointment so .
282165:10	Now I have to tell you that last year we raised a hundred and thirteen million pounds and of that over ninety per cent , that 's a hundred and four million pounds were actually spent on projects for children and I 'm very proud of that ratio indeed and I think it ought to give you , the raisers of money , a great deal of comfort because for a fund with two headquarters buildings which operates all over the world this is a distribution of funds of which to be proud .
282172:61	But those in the field , the front line could not continue without the less than glamorous work that has to be carried out back here in H Q. They also serve , who work in our offices , collect our money , keep our accounts make sure the administration is working well .
282178:53	If children are to be helped in the U K and throughout the world then we all have to succeed in persuading people to donate .
282207:22	Before they had the motorcycles they had to walk which meant a lot of travelling time and then less time at the , each village when they arrived .
282278:30	When you have n't got no one , you have to , sort of like find a way of doing it for yourself and it 's much harder .
282406:96	Parents need help with their own lives so that their children do n't suffer from the unemployment and homelessness that contribute to ill health and an unsafe living environment that too many children have to live with today .
282421:36	To net to get an education beyond primary level , children have to leave their village primary schools because the terms coincide with the peak agricultural seasons .
282440:39	This is going to be a year when we will all have to go that extra mile for children .
282446:10	We will have to be very sure that we know what we 're talking about when we meet them to persuade them that we need their funds more and we can make better use of them and we hope to raise around half of that twenty five million pounds from them .
282474:7	We must make very sure we know what we 're doing it for .
282651:87	We want it to be a day of celebration , but not only that , as with all parties we hope to receive presents , but the presents must be money for Save The Children .
282701:7	You must be joking .
282714:36	Then I saw the top tier of the cake and that has got to be the er piece , piece de resistance I think as the French say and I know that some very exciting ideas are coming out of the South East region .
282735:51	Erm there are all sorts of little rules , the every black sack that comes in has to be gone through , no matter how grotty , somewhere inside it there might be some really very , very valuable piece of equipment .
282831:127	I 'm certain that those of us who heard Mike Save The Children 's overseas director on the Today programme or our field director in Angola on the evening television news yesterday , can have hold nothing but pride , what they had to say of Save The Children 's work in that country , a country described as the heart of darkness a country with the world 's worse infant mortality rate .
282937:73	The collapse of communism in the former Eastern block and the disintegration of the former Soviet Union represent a major new challenge the governments have had to face .
282953:118	Well I 've said a few words about the Soviet Union but I would like to add that our programme of assistance to the Soviet Union and to other countries in central and Eastern Europe , while it 's had to grow rapidly in response to the urgent needs of reg region , it does not it has not grown and will not grow in any way er which will undermine our commitment to the developing world and er perhaps on that note I might turn to Africa .
282961:7	Success must depend on the efforts and policies of the countries themselves .
282966:101	Donors will help , Britain 's commitment of five hundred and fifty million pounds for the special programme of assistance to Africa since nineteen eighty , is testimony to that but African governments must own their reform programmes .
282984:8	It must for example , ensure an independent judiciary , provide health and education services , basic infrastructure and maintenance and it must bring about the economic environment that allows the private sector to create jobs and growth .
282984:63	It must for example , ensure an independent judiciary , provide health and education services , basic infrastructure and maintenance and it must bring about the economic environment that allows the private sector to create jobs and growth .
282985:104	In pressing ahead we cannot er overlook the position of the poorest , the social costs of not adjusting are much higher and affect many more people than the costs of adjusting but we must be prepared to help those at the bottom of society to cope and this is where you , as N G Os can play a special role .
283015:9	Such children must be assisted in gaining education and skills built around their existing work activities .
283022:7	We must have partnership between government and non-government if we are to achieve any degree of success in our aid efforts .
283037:228	My first , er , but sad duty is simply to say that Sir Kenneth , our President , had hoped to be here , but he 's had er , an operation and er , he is not really quite well enough , so I was asked as a Vice-President , whether I would stand in for him , at the weekend , and er I shall do my best , and erm , I 'm glad to have to opportunity of doing one or two things , but we 'll come to those in due time .
283078:7	It must however , be emphasised that these matters are not an end in themselves , but a means of enabling voluntary organisations to achieve their aims and objectives effectively , and I understand that that working party report will be published in February , and we all await it very much .
283140:69	Ours is a voice which cannot be ignored , but if we are to use our influence to full effect we must both recognise and be capable of using our strengths .
283165:94	The reasons for this deficit are largely associated with the , the trend of pay and price increases outstripping our income , and outstripping our projections of what we would have to spend .
283166:7	I have to say also that the future looks even tougher for us .
283167:118	The current trend of pay and price increases is more than we had hoped , and it 's , it 's certainly more than er , than er , the planned increase in our income will cover , and I have to say that the rate of turnover of staff has reduced even further and so we will be spending more on staff for that reason than we had planned .
283174:59	Overall if you look at the balance sheet , it still appears quite healthy , erm , nevertheless , I must point out that the balance sheet is composed largely of funds with specific purposes , and these specific purposes do not include simply propping up deficits on the mainstream activities .
283175:67	So we ca n't use the funds in our balance sheet , simply to carry on the way we are , we have to change .
283176:111	And we need to use the reserves that we do have in the balance sheet , we need to spend them wisely in order to achieve our objectives , our objectives for change , and we must recognise that they can only be spent once .
283178:71	Basically we are required to report anything erm , any liability which we know about , which does n't actually formally have to appear in the main accounts but which could arise in the future .
283272:22	Now at , at the moment we have to keep fifty percent of our investments in the narrow range and we may place fifty percent in the wider range .
283273:7	I have to say though , that when we the Council advise other charities on the investment powers that they should take when they 're established and when they draft their Memorandum of Association , erm , we advise them to take wider powers er , than these , and we advise them that they should not seek to constrain themselves by the Trustee Investment Act nineteen sixty-one , as our own flexibility is constrained .
283276:34	Secondly the , the constraint reduces the opportunity that we have to pursue the ethical investment policies which will have regard to the aims and objectives of the Council as a whole , and then lastly there is the matter of practicality .
283304:137	Secondly it requires that all transactions made on our behalf shall be reported promptly , I , I would emphasise that this is already the practice the investment tr , er , transactions are already reported to our Finance Department and trustees of course , must sign the necessary transfer forms .
283335:40	So I think your point is in effect met , but we have to observe very properly the requirements of the law .
283348:13	Of course we must be cautious about taking on difficult tasks as if to prove our social virility .
283353:17	Health authorities and local authorities must be encouraged to come to see the necessity of providing local umbrella groups such as Councils for Voluntary Service , with grant aid to develop industrial relations expertise , er , marketing help , P R help , and so on .
283356:27	But the important thing is that the voluntary sector must hijack the trends from the old statism to the new individualism , and steer it into a better way .
283358:23	From being mainly voluntarily established we must see the development of new catalysed organisations meeting specific needs .
283359:12	Statutory agencies will have to use a judicious mixture of grant and contract to help set up new organisations run by the community for the community , to create the range and choice required by consumers .
283360:19	The voluntary sector I believe must accept those developments whilst at the same time , demanding effective regulation and monitoring to create a managed community market .
283367:87	If central and local government are serious in their intent to create choice and consumerism , what I would call welfare consumerism in health and social care , then they must also take seriously the need to support voluntary organisations trying to meet those aspirations .
283373:11	The current government must recognise that it cannot continue to go down the line of an individualist anxiety- ridden state , of competitive individuals where the poor and disabled are left to starve on city streets .
283375:50	Whichever of the two main parties forms the government of the early nineteen nineties , it will have to create a greater consensus in health and social care as well as other areas of our national life .
283407:180	Or if they are there , they 're existing voluntary organisations which may be already very loaded , who 've got a lot of work to do , to get into a negotiating framework and so on , so the first the thing I 'd say in answer to you is that , N C V O and other must put a tremendous pressure on government and local authorities to fund the community development aspect of the pluralistic society which er , the current government seems to want .
283408:140	Erm , secondly , we will only be able to do that effectively and this is the point you were making about say , erm , school governors and so on , if people really feel they do have some genuine power , locally , it must be about enabling and empowering local groups to have power and take part within their community .
283475:60	Erm , because of the Nathan reports , I mentioned to you last year , we 're going to have to raise more money than we thought sometime ago .
283496:14	Good morning , I must say , I I stand before you today somewhat nervous , because erm , this is , this is my first to you as Treasurer , but this will be a slightly different speech from one 's that I have given in previous years .
283497:49	Treasurers suffer the erm , the occupational hazard that they always , to some extent , have to cry wolf .
283498:7	They have to advise caution in the use of finance .
283499:7	They have to judge quite carefully the extent to which they should er , advise the caution , because if they advise too much caution , then erm , er people will er , restrain themselves and then perhaps if things are n't really bad , no longer believe the Treasurer .
283503:7	I have to say , that the the year wo I that I 'm reporting on now , nineteen ninety , ninety-one was actually better than we had originally planned and expected , and in fact , that we did eliminate the deficit in that year .
283525:8	I have to say though , that market conditions have changed very substantially in the last couple of years , and we now have an opportunity before us , which is one which is unlikely to recur again .
283577:12	Er , I must apologise again for what , er the way I addressed you , but of course with all these women equality er , movements going on , I never know whether its Mr , Mrs , or Ms. Erm , now I may call on Doctor Manchago to second the motion , please .
283648:108	Tony in charge of services and communication , Simon in charge of policy and development , Richard in charge of resource development , and although it 's not on the script and she said I must n't to the script , I ought to mention also Samantha who has joined us as head of communications on whom , you may thank for all the sort of visuals that we 're having , and the bright idea of videoing er , our Chairman .
283662:52	If N C V O is to be able to fulfil this purpose effectively , we must be working closely with our members , and we must have their confidence and respect , and such confidence , of course , is a two way process .
283662:80	If N C V O is to be able to fulfil this purpose effectively , we must be working closely with our members , and we must have their confidence and respect , and such confidence , of course , is a two way process .
283664:65	Now it seems to me , that er , the watch-word for our policy development work over the next few years , must be effective co-ordination with our members and the wider voluntary sector .
283665:39	Our principle function within the policy development department within N C V O must be to work with , and not simply for our member and the wider sector .
283668:15	N C V O must therefore , draw together voluntary organisations effectively and be seen to be responsive and creative .
283669:119	There are many issues where a N C V O should be exercising leadership , sometimes a rather difficult concept , and there is no need to apologise for that , for using leadership at the right time , but it has to be a leadership by consent , rather than claimed without authority , and it is in this context that the policy development department in N C V O exists , to help channel voluntary sector concerns to opinion formers , and policy makers , regardless of party politics , regardless of political commitment .
283689:33	That will give us many important opportunities which we must not let drop .
283694:111	The publication of the Government 's Green Paper , health of the nation and all the work going on around the country , on the implementation programme for the community care reforms , means that N C V O must attempt to rebuild its own capacity , to undertake effective policy development work in these areas .
283699:40	If we 're to do this work effectively , er , then it has to be in conjunction with you .
283701:38	Working in conjunction effectively with you , our members , and it has to meet your needs and interests as well as our own , and I 'm therefore looking forward to the possibility , in fact , the certainty of us having a year of achievement us for the interests of the voluntary sector .
283745:33	In looking back at the department 's achievements , one has to accept that reorganisation which Judy and Simon have already referred to , has because of its sheer scale and impact on N C V O been something of an abiding preoccupation over the past twelve to eighteen months .
283836:161	Yes , I was going to to to add to that slightly , and to what Judy said , in in the sense that the implication , the question I think , is a correct one , that every organisation , and N C V O would n't be immune er , than from any other , have got to actually ensure that they keep this at the front of their agenda all the time .
283913:66	Good morning , ladies and gentlemen , can I just give you er , Tony apologies , er , unfortunately he has to be in Paris today , I know he 'd prefer to be with you , but he has to be in Paris today , and since he 's good at delegation , he 's actually asked me to come along and and to talk to you .
283913:126	Good morning , ladies and gentlemen , can I just give you er , Tony apologies , er , unfortunately he has to be in Paris today , I know he 'd prefer to be with you , but he has to be in Paris today , and since he 's good at delegation , he 's actually asked me to come along and and to talk to you .
283927:45	Now some of you here today might wonder , what a computer company has to do with the community .
284053:16	Likewise both business and government must have more than good intentions in order to turn the well meaning idealism into practical support , funding and long term dialogue , and the publication of a Charities Bill , is dying to increase public confidence in the sector , is a step in the right direction .
284059:50	I hope I 've demonstrated that corporate support , individual support , government support , must go hand in hand .
284063:84	Well , I 'm delighted to , I feel a bit like the er , that story about the professor and the chauffeur , though , which I must tell .
284066:168	He gives it very well , and he 's on on his way to an evening engagement , and the professor , says I 'm feeling very tired tonight , and I do n't think I want to give er , th the talk , but I do n't know , I I obviously I have to go , the chauffeur said , no problem , he said , all we need is to change hats , I 've heard you give that same talk so many times , I would actually give it .
284084:7	We have to look upon it with interest .
284095:25	If you want er , the pressures have to be carefully thought out , er , and I think you have to be able to demonstrate that it is , it is self interest , and I think one continues to actually use these words .
284095:65	If you want er , the pressures have to be carefully thought out , er , and I think you have to be able to demonstrate that it is , it is self interest , and I think one continues to actually use these words .
284097:10	And you have to use , and I 'm sure you do it already , you use the networks which are available to you , you have contacts , you have employees of companies working for you .
284100:31	Erm , in the same way , your own organisations must produce , I think , good quality pressure mechanisms , including ve very clear objectives , what you 're trying to achieve , and how you 're trying to achieve it , and the sort of resource you need , the sort of resource you need .
284129:31	I then become rather more hesitant , when I have to face up to the problems particularly of er , women looking after elderly parents , because the burden does seem to fall , as you would know , on the women .
284141:37	Yes , well I was , I was erm , I must put myself in historical context .
284160:128	So it 's easy for me to sit here and say , we think we 're doing a good job on the environment , because we 're not threatened , we do have to find ways round existing chemicals , we may have to pay , pay a higher price , but we 're not threatened in terms of the the core of our bottom line .
284164:13	So , I have to say , that er , I believe that companies which erm , find it easy to change , are of course , changing .
284166:10	Sadly we must bring this , er session to an end .
284169:10	I I must just now , say one or two very brief things before you disa
284180:103	and then you were inveigled to the R and D and then you inveigled to become a Vice Chair , and today you 've been handling the ceremony so well , we 've had to keep you in cotton wool to make sure that er , that you kept your health .
284189:52	Ar , now I forgot what I was going to say , so I 'll have to go back and look at my piece of paper now .
284276:85	Erm I s do n't think I can give you a precise answer to that question er off the cuff Mr Colgan , I think we 'd have to let you have a note on those figures
284286:41	a very good piece of negotiation on your part erm that er there must be a reason why industry 's prepared to a lost leader .
284312:143	I think it 's true to say that the design responsible company , Deutsch Aerospace erm has discovered that er there 's a lot more software in this system than they had originally imagined and the , their sub contractors of course , they 've had to er write various parts of that for them and erm putting together the four elements of the programme has been a lot more complex than anyone imagined .
284316:141	Erm the inertial measurement unit which is er a rather critical piece of equipment er in er a system of this nature initially did not perform to the the full level of requirement that that we we desire so you know , some further development had to be done on that before it would match the system .
284347:48	Yes well , for the experimental aircraft programme British Aerospace specified what G E C had to do and er a a this time , if you like , Deutsch Aerospace has taken on the equivalent role that B A E had for the experimental aircraft programme and er Deutsch Aerospace are not without experience in flight controls they have .
284424:163	Er , so i it 's er changes of that kind that have been looked at because if you move production work out of one nation into the other to get a nice rationalised allocation of work , you build this wing , you build that wing and so on , you then have got to do something with the minor components to get back to you original erm work share allocation and percentage times .
284429:217	As it 's turned out , it 's not efficient because the the ray dome spent a tremendous amount of time moving from one country to the other , there 's no doubt about that and before production we would want to see that particular nonsense removed and the whole thing made a lot more efficient , but for one or two development batch ray domes then you know , they 'll just have to learn from that lesson .
284453:106	It has had considerable benefits , it 's had one or two drawbacks and er I think the biggest lesson that we have probably learned so far from the Eurofighter programme , is that we have to be very careful when we make work sharing agreements in future , that er we do n't try to drive the work sharing requirement down to too low a level .
284455:21	But if you say we must share every piece of equipment in those ratios , then you do create management difficulties and the potential for delay and and indeed that can in turn add to costs .
284598:105	Thank you , i do you feel a little uneasy at changing operational requirements based on er an assessment of a threat in nineteen ninety two , ninety three , which I presume would have to remain valid until two thousand and twenty .
284620:97	As the cost of Eurofighter increases does there come a point where like the F twenty two i it becomes unaffordable and by how much would the performance of Eurofighter have to be degraded before it becomes equivalent to the nearest alternative ?
284706:104	We will continue to look at er the future programme er we will also as you know , look at ballistic missile defence which is another element to this and that must need to be fact facted in as well but I think clearly we are not talking about in the medium term er and longer term , we are talking about er a fairly late stage of the programme .
284748:33	Do you set out the sum , er you must set out some calculation of how many you are likely to to lose over the life of the aircraft , is there a percentage figure you could give us for that ?
284752:37	Would that be er a practical thing to do or would you have to start redesigning a new aircraft ?
284775:122	Well I I I would n't er pin point the German attitude on this one , I mean after all we did collaborate with Germany very successfully on the tornado which has a nuclear role but the the four governments must first of all decide if that is what we want to build into this aeroplane and they decided that they did not at that stage .
284782:260	The D R one A is currently an excellent er tactical reconnaissance aircraft , all weather , at night etcetera and er it will go on well into the next century so there 's no great hurry to to make a decision er one of the first points has gotta be decided is whether we carry the reconnaissance equipment in a pod under the aircraft replacing some of the other weapons or whether we try to build it in and er but taking first things first we have to get the requirement sorted out .
284791:18	So are you gonna have to restrict training in er operational flights jaguar at a stretch just to stretch out the hours ?
284998:50	Now that 's a costly business as we know to our cost , we did n't have to pay the three hundred thousand pounds , the pension fund did , but we had to risk paying those to go to court .
284998:93	Now that 's a costly business as we know to our cost , we did n't have to pay the three hundred thousand pounds , the pension fund did , but we had to risk paying those to go to court .
284999:98	Now next year something else might happen and somebody may be forced to go to court , if they cannot go to court they cannot get justice and they have to wait to see what happens .
285000:129	Now we have in the Companies Act a Table A which gives you a suggested er model , Memorandum of Association and Articles Association , why not a dedicated pensions act which says in here these are the minimum terms you must contain in your Trust Deed .
285002:41	People would know exactly where they stood then and we would n't have to go keep going to the courts to develop the theory of Trust Law .
285003:149	So you 'd leave the Trust Law in existence , so you would n't call cause a total legal revolution , but you would impose on that a spy of legal requirements which if trusts wish to through Trust Law enhance , they could , but they h all have to bring their agreements up to that minimum ?
285040:41	However , I think the practicalities in the situation are that we have to face the fact that they are not going to behave impartially and you see we have a classic example in er the circumstances of our own situation as described by John .
285058:25	If the Trust Deed says the pension has to be paid at sixty , then the Trust Deed says it has to be paid at sixty , surely that you know , that 's something you ca n't get rid of .
285058:64	If the Trust Deed says the pension has to be paid at sixty , then the Trust Deed says it has to be paid at sixty , surely that you know , that 's something you ca n't get rid of .
285139:22	Goodey has said that the regulator has got to give his approval that would stop that ?
285174:15	He wo n't keep have to be going off to court to find out what is the law at that moment of time .
285309:78	Erm on the seventeenth of June I was told that there was gonna be a meeting on the eighteenth erm to which I would have to appear concerning my drink driving .
285340:29	Straightforward conversation wife to wife , well again she must have been told that by her husband to even mention it .
285361:149	Well on the Wittering job he said he wanted somebody there you know er myself as manager to oversee the job but on the Sheffield Wednesday job , incidentally I 'd I got the contract from them both , the Sheffield Wednesday job was done I 'd only ever had to visit it once and that was at my request not at anybody else 's and either way both erm the Wittering and the Sheffield Wednesday er there have been other drivers going .
285362:16	Er I have never had to go solely on my own so to speak .
285401:83	Erm yeah , but it was there was something that only certain employees that time the start of the pension like myself , erm I have to pay five pound a week after tax for my pension .
285428:38	If they 've made you redundant that 's what they have to do .
285429:7	They have to give you a week 's pay for each year that you have been employed them a as pay in lieu of notice .
285433:114	It 's very clumsy language but I think what what they 're saying is that if you go to the tribunal and you get compensation , anything they pay you now is going to have to come off that .
285438:40	A tribunal will either re instate you or it will say they have to pay compensation .
285461:11	Some other employee has to go and fetch him in the morning
285549:50	And then if er you want a so solicitor with you on that day we 'll have to come to some arrangement with you privately about the costs .
285557:29	Erm er basically I 'm going to h have to boot you out because I 've got somebody else waiting for me .
285644:7	You have to tell the D S S .
285682:163	Okay , what we 'll do then is get you to sign this form here , we call it a green form fairly obviously from its colour and that means that I can do up to erm about eighty six pounds worth of er a bit more depending on on what we have to do , and you do n't have to pay us anything towards that .
285682:186	Okay , what we 'll do then is get you to sign this form here , we call it a green form fairly obviously from its colour and that means that I can do up to erm about eighty six pounds worth of er a bit more depending on on what we have to do , and you do n't have to pay us anything towards that .
285716:30	Erm got fined a hundred and ninety six pounds and has got to pay me fifty pound compensation .
285746:7	I have to say I 'm a little doubtful as to whether legal aid will be granted because the courts now take the view that if there 's no contest between you and him as to who 's going to look after the child , then they wo n't make a court order .
285774:34	and he thinks because I 've he 's pleaded had to plead guilty in court
285960:25	It may be that we do n't have to use all of that .
286090:15	So you 're gonna have to if you do any work for L E As
286168:13	tomorrow it would have to be .
286201:39	It was rather comical actually because he said er , You must now go and make an appointment to see Mr , and I said , Well actually we already ha
286290:20	Yes I sha I shall have to go and talk to the tax people I know about er the the set up .
286294:32	Er this next form is basically one that we have to send to the Benefit Office
286320:8	I must admit on every form I 've put the two and I thought afterward I 'd better
286412:7	I have to sign my life away to get these yellow forms .
286418:14	so this one we have to be very careful with it .
286555:5	have to be away and we do n't hear from you we think , Oh you naughty boy , yes .
286568:15	It is it must be yes .
286572:7	I must get my glasses changed .
286573:7	They must print their
286647:4	must come first before
286788:55	Southwell Southwell faces Mansfield which rather gets us in the stick you see because we have to come here for Benefit Office interviews and things like that but you got to Mansfield
286793:77	and er with my son particularly earlier on in his career things were going round and round in circles and in the end I had to step in at one point , grab all the papers as they came past as they were and saying , come on .
286858:12	one which must have been probably about so thick
286881:13	they did obviously have to ask him a lot more questions
286888:10	I I must say I 've also been er you know very very impressed and er learnt quite a lot just attending these courses that you 've you 've got running here .
286896:13	Allowance Scheme one had to attend a mandatory seven day Start Your Own Business course .
286912:47	to use your judgement as to whether you say to somebody , Yeah you must finish this before I 'm gonna consider you or
286995:7	I must admit I .
287003:14	I st I have to use my fingers these days to carry forward the the
287296:17	Well it 's gonna have to be the white .
287365:7	You had to be careful that the builders did n't catch us .
287444:10	you 'll have to have a couple of washers
287761:63	Having trouble with both these pens today , I left them in the car last night , I think they must have got a bit cold .
288082:21	That 's a I I had to do a little bit of er adaption work on the on the curtain rail put that on .
288143:9	So I have to make sure it 's measured right .
288179:7	It must be white .
288238:10	You 'll have to hold it up to
288408:26	Well yes , I think we 'll have to stick to white .
288469:13	Well it would have to be this end .
288598:66	tape on the it went and did it again on me now and it 's well and truly gone I 'll have to buy another one .
288776:31	Wh what we do you see , they have to wander around the showground doing this , so we get our traffic through the showground and they see other things while they 're going around .
289117:10	We 'd have to order
289120:10	We 'd have to order some more would we ?
289201:7	Ideally have to be recruiting before then really .
289401:43	But we had it at the N E C for a week and it must have produced hundreds of cages on a routine daily basis .
289714:7	You must think I 'm absolutely barking just to have been sat with this in front of me and not done anything about it .
289716:9	No Philip must have been er wondering what on earth it was doing there .
289791:17	Of course they they have to do all that out themselves .
289881:16	And so er the guy had to bring the whole project forward a month .
289920:7	They had to manufacture that part itself .
289950:22	erm the inside they they had to redesign that because the wood er had almost become charcoal were the
289958:25	And er and that that 's They had to take the top off to make it safe , that 's why I say a couple of hours work to put the top back on , erm makes balance .
290069:25	and we balance it out that we had to built the caravan , the deadline we had to tow it across there in back end of March .
290069:54	and we balance it out that we had to built the caravan , the deadline we had to tow it across there in back end of March .
290070:12	Erm so it had to have all the lighting , official lighting for the continent and so on and so forth .
290171:9	All I have to do is go and see her and say I want to know see each one ticked .
290609:9	Do n't have to do it done that one .
290683:102	This is one where I put the price up and then we went and wrote to him with a net price list showing a lower price than I 'd put up and we had to reduce it .
290700:90	P O A by the way , another thing I 'm thinking of doing is saying , if you want a net price enter in there , it has to come through a manager or
290705:7	You have to sign it off .
290751:49	The profit would have been minus cos the costs would still be there so it must be a cancellation .
291214:25	It 's just that and then we have got to get this sorted out long
291285:55	I want to try and get it done , bearing in mind Elaine 's going to have to have the baby on Friday if she has n't had it before .
291361:7	There must be some dimensions that have been more thoroughly checked than than er
291387:12	They do n't have to test them or anything .
291390:81	The thing is , the machine tool industry or super precision requirements be become use and take for granted a noise specification , the fact that it must run quietly .
291562:45	There 's seven pence on the table , now take ten away , must be mad , yeah , so , anyway , we do n't like saying we ca n't do it , in maths , so we pretend we can , and we work out this complete new system , it 's all a game really , it 's all a silly game
291593:13	If you actually had to do it .
291841:156	Okay , so you can convert any per centage into a normal frac I mean you can leave this sort of fraction is no problem , like I say , erm , seventy eight per cent is a , seventy eight over a hundred , and normally you would n't have to bother cancelling them down because you 'd just go to use your calculator
291988:56	Yeah , well , I was in a bo , I 'm in a book club , and you have to add your own erm per centage on
292101:24	So , we 're going to have to borrow one from the , and then put a minus one , put that one there , leaves five , and minus one , minus two , leaves , ca n't do that anyway , so you 're going to have to borrow this one
292101:140	So , we 're going to have to borrow one from the , and then put a minus one , put that one there , leaves five , and minus one , minus two , leaves , ca n't do that anyway , so you 're going to have to borrow this one
292181:9	do n't have to add , no VAT to be added on
292217:31	Well , it well , it well yeah , it has to be rather awkward to read that I think , I do n't think I 'd fancy having a go at Norwegian .
292228:124	Apparently one of the the little erm boys she say , he wets himself all the time , and she turns round and she goes , he goes to er , ha ha , he started himself , and you have to change all his clothes , like that and she said
292250:27	so you 're in the end , you have to say to him , well you 'll have to wet your pants , cos because , it 's like a bi bit longer the trek .
292250:55	so you 're in the end , you have to say to him , well you 'll have to wet your pants , cos because , it 's like a bi bit longer the trek .
292308:10	You usually have to start in the middle of the page .
292328:76	the inside nought instead of the outside , or you could have it upside down or anything else , but that 's pointing North , you must line it up so it points North , right , now what bearing am I from you ?
292333:17	Because the first thing you have to do is what ?
292334:43	Before you can take a bearing at all there 's something you have to do , which is what , what am I about to do ?
292337:8	You must put in your North , otherwise you have n't got anything to take a bearing from .
292428:5	have to point out , Joe , and they all go now , okay , now a new game .
292429:28	You point at the window , but you must all turn round that way , turn round to your right so you 're going round , then clockwise they probably would n't understand , but
292431:8	they must keep turning round to your right until you point at them , and you must n't go the short way , and you can play like erm , sort of version of musical chairs where you eliminate the ones who get it wrong , you know ,
292431:51	they must keep turning round to your right until you point at them , and you must n't go the short way , and you can play like erm , sort of version of musical chairs where you eliminate the ones who get it wrong , you know ,
292584:66	Do n't forget the big thing is about the bearing of and from , the bearing of B , and everyone must have gone and put the p put the protractor on B
292617:153	And , and draw it , and stand up and think how you 're going to do it , and maybe you sort of , you know , sit here or something , when I 've gone and face the window and say , that 's North , and I must make sure I get it set up , get this the right way up and ,
292696:40	because I ca n't do them on my main one , I 'll have to power up another one and getting wires between them and
292700:80	and you can probably do , I do n't know if you could do print screen , no , if you got , you 'll have to learn graphics , but anyway , I 'll tell you about that when , when you do it , my numbers in there , take all the rubbish away .
292933:44	which reminds me , yeah , the last block I got I 'll have to take it back , it was the wrong colour , we 've got some silver got some , got
293016:17	Exactly where the surface has to be .
293024:85	Erm example there of T. You 'll recognize the T. Now the first thing I should remind you is of course that to recognize anything we must have something to compare it against .
293058:18	Now in that case we had to select those measures er by knowledge of the problem .
293064:15	You you do n't have to know anything about the problem to specify them .
293065:55	Where we 're taking measures from the image er such as height width etcetera we 'd have to know a lot about the image to take those measures .
293085:35	Got a lot to blame to blame for I must admit .
293094:31	So here we 've got binary inputs to there must be two to the two outputs I E four possible combinations .
293132:12	And you might have to you have to do that in in the order of nanoseconds .
293132:21	And you might have to you have to do that in in the order of nanoseconds .
293133:37	But of course something like this would do that but you have to allow for the jitter as well and this sort of algorithm might might be the way to do it .
293160:21	In fact recognition you do n't have to guarantee that you will solve the problem .
293173:90	We could test it to see if we get an output , we do n't but we could do , there 's no need because all we have to do in effect is just set the weights of the decoders that are actually coming out .
293186:31	Testing for these sort of systems erm we had to decide which of these responses is best .
293189:7	We have to make a decision on those responses just like in a normal network .
293212:33	Well we 've only got binary decoders here so we have to cope we have to change something .
293212:48	Well we 've only got binary decoders here so we have to cope we have to change something .
293253:20	Before we do this we have to apply a mapping function M. The mapping function is important because as I say these wires are connected to these pixels here .
293254:7	I must know exactly how those are connected in which order .
293301:19	As I say the method has got to recognize things it has n't seen before .
293363:7	Helen had to write to Penny erm voicing the all green party 's objection to the supporters scheme that the National Party are putting out .
293382:23	Coordinator 's report please before we have to spell check the minutes .
293383:50	Well staggeringly enough I do n't actually have one this week because the only things I have to report are covered at in under energy conservation bill .
293494:49	You see apart from anything else if those people joined through us then we we must make good .
293498:10	It it has to be fixed by either us or the national party .
293521:20	It just says that we have to make the the call for nominations so long before we put out the selection ballot .
293537:57	Which is actually two days before we next have a meeting which means I 'm gonna have to slap another one together in a big hurry .
293558:32	Okay I 'll knock those up and I 'll have to run that by my household .
293574:29	Again if I collect more material than I have to use no problem .
293623:15	I think we must have missed a briefing from
293624:7	Must must have done .
293659:14	Which we 'd have to take .
293695:51	And if there 's four of us there definitely then that 's we only each have to cook once while we 're there .
293726:25	Well strangely enough I think we 'll have to have double rooms .
293749:25	Where you know so as not to have to risk going having to go to an expensive B and B because all the cheap places have gone .
293777:47	Well this is why it would be a good idea to so people will have to decide in advance and just see how we go for
293778:9	Do you have to send off a deposit or anything ?
293781:51	I would suggest that given the decision we prepared to make now even if you have to send a deposit get the local party to stump up the deposit and collect the money as soon as convenient from the people who are committed to going .
293795:9	Do n't have to do things like erm .
293897:54	I 'm asking the people round the table to write these extra couple of letters because we must be activists because we 're here by definition .
293924:16	In this case we must not only win the vote but we must have a hundred M Ps in the House to vote for the closure .
293924:38	In this case we must not only win the vote but we must have a hundred M Ps in the House to vote for the closure .
293927:22	But not all of those hundred must vote for the must vote for the closure there must be a hundred people there to take part in the vote is that right ?
293927:35	But not all of those hundred must vote for the must vote for the closure there must be a hundred people there to take part in the vote is that right ?
293927:54	But not all of those hundred must vote for the must vote for the closure there must be a hundred people there to take part in the vote is that right ?
293931:7	We must have a hundred M Ps voting for the closure .
293967:45	To be honest I think we should be grateful they do n't have to have the court magician come in
293988:43	They 're they 're the eyes and ears of their boss and they have to report any political pressure so we have to find something for them to report basically .
293988:67	They 're they 're the eyes and ears of their boss and they have to report any political pressure so we have to find something for them to report basically .
294046:55	And the M Ps who who asked to put it forward including Alan they they had to you know they came to Ron to ask , Can we put your bill forward .
294130:37	Well I think what they suggest to me that we have to pay for the poster site .
294143:7	There must be lots of other .
294144:17	I mean this they must have got my name through Miriam so they must already have worked out the they were working
294144:44	I mean this they must have got my name through Miriam so they must already have worked out the they were working
294151:20	I think that I 'll have to confirm with the company .
294236:7	We have to be very busy .
294244:57	Yeah if we 're actually ever gonna make use of it we will , joking aside , have to try and get something .
294270:10	You just have to be approved by the that 's all .
294275:17	Does n't mean you have to go .
294285:42	And for candidates erm yeah I 'll I 'll stand I 'll have to bite the boys again .
294293:26	Presumably in the selection ballot we do n't have to
294298:17	But we do n't definitely have to sign people .
294379:23	John Major saying that people will have to accept restrictions on on car usages and it 's an amazing thing to come from a Tory .
294603:13	Erm , you must be honest about this , er , is anybody feel clearer about these , the apostrophe , than they did half an hour ago .
294636:12	What you have to remember is that you need a pair of commas and not just one .
294652:13	James , it must be your turn to
294738:14	But what you must n't use is the comma .
294806:7	I must say erm I , I do wonder whether the district council might be enabled to say unless goods are sold from a car boot this is not a car boot sale er , therefore , we would put a ban on all commercial vans and vehicle entering these sites er that 's not being articles described in the er in the er maybe that 's something you could look at .
294811:20	and erm , but I I have to say that I , I do believe that we need to address more particularly er the transport a aspects of this and the planning aspects of it which , I think er are tending to get eased out of the er agenda , any way , if I may say er in respect of trading standards and the legal aspects of er the , the er produce that 's being sold there .
294824:142	So that the social , the social idea in the towns and people can gather in a market place and do what they will without too much trouble , but nevertheless and immediately you try to restrict , we , we run into trouble , but we must protect the people and that 's the purpose for the trading standards .
294829:17	On that licence you have to indicate when you 're going to have erm this market , you have to indicate how many stalls , how many people you expect to attract , the times you 're gonna be open and you have to give a months notice .
294829:61	On that licence you have to indicate when you 're going to have erm this market , you have to indicate how many stalls , how many people you expect to attract , the times you 're gonna be open and you have to give a months notice .
294829:134	On that licence you have to indicate when you 're going to have erm this market , you have to indicate how many stalls , how many people you expect to attract , the times you 're gonna be open and you have to give a months notice .
294863:56	We recognised through that review that to train all those people to do the work we would have to use the officers specialist inspectors and therefore those specialist inspectors would be carrying out less inspections during this year because they 'd actually be carrying out some training .
294887:225	I 'm slightly concerned about this because it said that other matters erm we do n't know what other matters until the inspector has been in , in June and has identified those other matters , presumably when we get the further inspector 's report next Autumn or after June , it will address issues which may have been ones he has addressed this year and maybe not , er and we will have to look at that inspector 's report when we receive it .
294900:125	Thank you Chairman I , I actually agreed with those not so much that erm I , I have problems with erm other matters , it is more extra to be examined and because it actually says that it has to be examined once , and will therefore be re-examined erm , erm I am sure if it should be examined they have to put exact what it means examine in and before and as you say er you will be the first to say .
294900:196	Thank you Chairman I , I actually agreed with those not so much that erm I , I have problems with erm other matters , it is more extra to be examined and because it actually says that it has to be examined once , and will therefore be re-examined erm , erm I am sure if it should be examined they have to put exact what it means examine in and before and as you say er you will be the first to say .
294936:7	I have to say Chairman that I find that the suggested resolution of six is totally adequate to deal with and I , I have read er the motion proposed by through a couple of times , and you know , it 's having a few frills here and there and some are , I , I , I find this one thing er more than adequate er to deal with the situation and er I would move that resolution formally .
294976:84	Erm yes , Mr Chairman I should like to apologise to Bob for interrupting him then because er the enthusiasm about the green code business of course has to do with the Hatfield community project and is not initiated by Welwyn Hatfield when in the use er Herts County Council Paul in the community project , but nevertheless the green cone idea is the individual person , it 's not the District Council and it 's not somebody else taking a taking green erm green type away for composting .
294989:117	There is evidence around the country particularly in , in , in , in Milton Keynes where that sort of arrangement applies and I think we as a County Council as the waste er as the Disposal Authority must make sure that we put in place arrangements which will encourage that sort of thing to happen .
294992:7	We must ensure that any recycling point or any , any er disposal er points that we have and they may be er recycling points if , if , if , if this proposal is , is actually accepted .
295072:47	trained and nevertheless it is a disturbing thing and the development of this County has to do , not only with businesses succeeding and also with people who are actually making those businesses work and the only way you can do it is by having people employed doing useful things .
295143:258	The redevelopment of the er derelict factory site into smaller industrial units and making it er a form of want for a better phrase , enterprise zone where thanks to subsidies from the government and the E E C , we will look into making it rate free , reduced rents , etc. , er increase capital allowances for companies going in there so you could attract the needed capital intensive industries that will meet the high tech need that we have the need to have to create high tech jobs .
295155:88	Yes Mr Chairman erm I understand the motive behind this proposal resolution but I think the mover perhaps is unaware of what 's actually going on and have to decide and so I would like to speak against this resolution and I think the constructive thing to do so we do n't send the wrong messages would be to er I , I will move an amendment er and I will explain what I 'm doing as I speak .
295170:22	the draft of the , it must be a twenty page Officer Report , that will be going next week to the Economic Development Council
295185:7	I have to advise the information to the economic development panel which indicates from our survey that the report carried out last year by Consultants that the airfield , the runway in Hatfield makes only a very minor contribution to the economy of Hertfordshire .
295203:35	if anything can be done to say one of must take those steps are needed to be taken up .
295325:59	point of personal explanation , that 's exactly what I did n't say , I said we had to ensure that walkers were able to use the places they can walk where horses can are , are also using that er , er , er route as well .
295332:283	I do feel that this is necessary because we are allocating or just allocating our proposed budget er a substantial amount of extra resources through the rights of way which I am thoroughly in favour of but I do think we need to know how that money is going to be used and which of the items which are to appear in the report are going to be covered by that money and which is still going to need to be addressed next year when we have to book in time for it for next year .
295369:63	I just wonder whether the Chairman might ask for another verdict and then if that 's tied it will have to go up before Council . .
295441:32	It is the fourth in the series and I have to say it 's fourth unsatisfactory er .
295478:19	To represent Hertfordshire residents we must give notice to the Government that is surely serious , sli slitshot consultation is no way to supervise the development of these airports .
295481:7	We must however
295482:9	and we must insist that the Government either justifies or reports its position .
295503:77	perhaps Hertfordshire County Council average they actually got some information I 'm sa , I 'm sorry to say Mr ' s got no have to state the position so far , not officer .
295531:35	However , erm this is the first chance I 've had to speak today so I ca n't take all the blame of the er , of the , of the late start , erm I do n't know whether it would make it any easier to the my colleagues on my right or my left erm to accept the Liberal resolution .
295564:8	They have to transfer either to another internal flight or to the roads and again tells us that eighty per cent of Heathrow 's passengers arrive there by road .
295583:80	Er and we came with a very strong view I thought certainly to conclusion and I did that er , that those things need strengthening and must be a in taking part of any further distraction er at Heathrow .
295609:47	I thought I detected from that last speech Chairman that er Liberal Democrat group must help the enitre united in terms of what it .
295622:13	You do n't have to go to Amsterdam first , but you come to Heathrow , a lot of people assume they have to go to right into London .
295622:72	You do n't have to go to Amsterdam first , but you come to Heathrow , a lot of people assume they have to go to right into London .
295644:9	The it must be part and only a part of an integrated transport system , not only for the South East but the Country as a whole .
295648:109	whether it 's a large economic growth in Europe in places like Milan , Innsbruck er Barcelona , all have these systems where an extra terminal capacity is only part of the jigsaw that 's had to be met .
295649:38	Now it may in our statement of case , and it must say that the points that er , er , it 's not the shopping list that you put down there , the cross rail link is vitally important to the economy and money .
295651:58	terminal five does n't exist , it could be , that could be the case , research has to be done to see what er , yeah it could be that air , air line capacity and air line will drop as a result of er forward thinking rail scheme and there is evidence from the Rhone to Seine Rider Scheme that 's been undertaken by the French , German and Swiss governments of the a drop in demand for internal flights in those areas and because of the German equipment everything is there .
295658:103	erm they have not in the past proved themselves to be the most capable o of people to er to support these things so in conclusion I 'd say that we must put this as part of a shopping list , the shopping list is on there er it is something to bring London and the South East of England which includes Hertfordshire and to make it an economic and viable area and look at the evidence of the other cities and I hope that er all of you will support the motion .
295687:48	Dealing with Jane 's point with that , I hope she now understands we must .
295714:82	You cannot talk about regeneration of of an economy or or s sustained economy , er it is one added to agenda and we will have to prepare to let the economy just over the border at Heathrow fade away and give it to another country .
295715:26	Er so o , o only you have to follow the policy er which is sustainable for all the items that are on the agenda .
295737:15	I think we must seek clarification Mr and your willing to take the resolution and drop the first two lines of your resolution .
295787:7	I must urge you to support our resolutions so that Herts County Council can join the many other Council and other organisation that are pressing the government to change it 's mind .
295847:14	If that money has to come out of the existing budget , then we should , or the Chief Constable , or the Police Committee ought to look at the priorities again .
295872:127	So it 'll be nice to see the tables turned , and Mr start , keep rather quiet about the number of extra policemen , sorry , police officers needed in this county , and other counties in the country , because he 'll have to pay for it himself wo n't he ?
295896:58	There 's obviously been a misunderstanding there , a lack of communication or whatever , but whereas some departments have got to grips with the issue , unfortunately police wor finance working party just stuck to the traditional way , rather reminiscent of Mr ' s old budget working party days , which does n't get to grips with the real needs and the real costs .
295899:265	Ah , but you 're going to be getting some extra police officers by taking them off er , paperwork , er you 're gonna get two thousand three hundred I see in the press , well that as shown , that of course will be twenty three , but if anybody here thinks the Chief Constable 's gonna produce twenty three new police officers through reductions in paperwork and through the other initiatives the Home Secretary has announced , well I do n't believe them , and we shall have to wait and see .
295938:115	Yeah , I think that we need to look into more depth the issue of the County Farms estate , we agreed from the start it was something that could not be rushed , and we had to , the principle question that needed to be answered was that was there a viability for County Farms or role for County Farms in the nineteen nineties .
296022:90	I do n't know whether he 's read the County Farms Estate report , but it was actually option two , was one of the proposals we had to consider , which was to was to dispose of about a third of the estate , reduce it from twelve thousand acres to nine thousand acres , which was actually rejected at erm , the property sub-committee by all parties , including Labour .
296115:49	Mr , oh well , we 've already appointed him so at least we do n't have to alter the outcome .
296150:51	Erm , if members do n't like the word consumer then I think they would have to use public , er it does cover , I I think the title County Public Protection Officer would er , er satisfy Mr and I do n't think it would upset the Chief Fire Officer .
296152:4	must n't forget .
296180:67	But it is only right , it 's public money , that if we are owing money , that we should have to use some of the er money from realisation of assets , to repay the debt .
296182:72	And I get rather tired of the constant accusations that councils ca n't spend , they 're not allow , they , they have to , they lose fifty percent of receipts , they do n't lose them , they go to the benefit of the chargepay er tax , council tax payers of this county , in reducing the debt and reducing the debt burden of interest , er interest on the budget .
296197:66	It should be a matter of judgement for local authorities to what degrees they are indebted , because they do have to pay the interest , by and large from the er , from the money they raise on erm , on on council tenants , and and from other income .
296393:99	I think it would be when the committee comes to the director of property services and says , we would like this to happen , that 's when we 'd have to come to you before the application
296401:105	And time and time again the planning officers , and Mr said , this is not the right form to do it , we are a planning authority and it is a decision that has to be taken by the service committee .
296419:104	Now is this a suggestion the thin end of the wedge , that we now start taking away the authority of our service committees to decide what they want to do , and have to pass it back up the line for decisions to be made , because quite frankly , I do n't want to come down here five days a week , ten hours a day for full council meetings .
296425:36	Erm , and therefore , that Planning Committee erm , basically has to vote in favour of development , unless there are over-riding planning reasons why they should not .
296479:33	We went in with an open mind , but I have to be honest , the presentation was so abysmal , that there was no way that we could in fact continue with them , and we have the same problem with the cleaning contract .
296499:51	It 's only while they stay so in-house as a D S O , that we have to be so careful about what we do and what we do n't .
296500:18	And I think we have got to let them compete competitively with the private sector , we 've got to push them further out .
296504:7	I have to admit to being somewhat encouraged by er some of the comments that have been made here .
296508:34	And er , the competing package , which incidentally I have to tell you were the D S Os own staff who decided to do their own management buyout , er , of the service .
296539:18	So I think we have to do them , but I think it is very important that we do not erm , er talk to the , or communicate with the other member authorities in a way that looks as if this is Wiltshire saying , well we want to find a way of flogging off this asset without worrying about what happens to the future of the service .
296547:7	I have to say that when Mr was there , he did n't mention one single word about a supplementary revenue estimate , did he ?
296598:119	Now as you probably know this is a level nine course it 's a it 's a course on which a platform is erected for other courses as Gordon said then the the introduction to management you have to make a short presentation do n't you but it does n't concentrate just on this .
296609:108	It may well be that you do n't actually do that , it may be that you have one to one meetings with people or group meetings er which could be when you have to put across your point of view .
296658:36	This was dropped on me out of the blue , I must admit this course
296764:131	Okay , so what we 're looking at over these two days and what in order for you to be able to say yes we 've achieved the objectives er by tomorrow is how to use that time that we have to prepare to to the most er efficient and effective so that e the preparation you know when you 've prepared it that yes when I stand up to speak I 'm gonna be able to put these points over effectively and make the presentation memorable .
296795:66	. . Try it out when you leave here , try it out in the meetings and the presentations that you have to make I encourage you to do that , to try it out in your day to day working and for those people who have either already been on this course or are coming on this course after you that you meet encourage them to do the same , because there 's nothing like encouragement and feedback from each other to be able to use these new ideas .
296865:88	But this this nervous thing is a very primitive instinct and I 'm just coming up to a word I never can pronounce so you 're going to have to help me with this one .
296884:9	But you have to have some level of arousal has to be something pumping round you round your blood your brain has to be working in some way to be able to perform .
296884:33	But you have to have some level of arousal has to be something pumping round you round your blood your brain has to be working in some way to be able to perform .
296884:73	But you have to have some level of arousal has to be something pumping round you round your blood your brain has to be working in some way to be able to perform .
296927:33	Well I mean what 's er what do we have to think about
296946:116	To the size absolutely , to the size of the audience so if we say a one to one we 've got a certain level of conversational power if you say so with a group like this it has to be
296958:21	Variety that 's right there has to be variety because because if you talk in a monotone all the time then it all becomes rather boring does n't it ?
297043:82	Right exactly because you might you might have the client or a representative of the client as well as architects and people who would so you have to be careful do n't you in terms of using the right words .
297048:24	Technical yeah the technical people but you have to ensure do n't you that with with your audience that you understand who they are but if you do n't then you have to keep it to a common denominator .
297048:101	Technical yeah the technical people but you have to ensure do n't you that with with your audience that you understand who they are but if you do n't then you have to keep it to a common denominator .
297087:40	In a way this standing behind and it 's unfortunate we have to have something as big as this table er and if I stand behind it then you know Gordon 's not getting my full centre line yep .
297091:28	There 's a gap over which these words have to flow .
297093:69	Now if I stood here all the time for two days and presented to you just standing here do your eyes move have to move if you 're watching me all the time your eyes are fixed are n't they in one position ?
297094:31	Yeah and the problem is that that because you have to look in one position it means that that the whole thing becomes boring and and your interest starts to drift .
297141:151	Yes , absolutely so questions er a very definite way of involving the audience and again it gives a measure of feedback does n't it because if you get the right answer you know that they are with you and you know they are understanding what you have to say .
297175:80	Just do that that , that 's what I find is the best thing to do and then carry on with what you have to say and then the gestures become quite natural because all of this this is is not I 'm not trying to
297178:12	Yes , there must be be a reason and as I 'm sure , I mean like like the objective , and then what you can do at this stage in the design process is once you 've got the objective then you select those themes or ideas from your what you 've done just now to support that objective , so that when you come up my objective is to convince you or my objective is to inform you then the information that you 're going to give out supports that objective .
297235:52	You 've got to try and hold on to so much information that something eventually has to drop .
297305:73	What are the skills that we need when we stand up in front of people to actually deliver what we have to say
297329:57	Structured thought which had as its main attributes three themes of course before you had that you had to have a clear objective which helped you to choose what those three themes were , and why why did we choose three as a based on
297340:81	There were a lot a lot involved there er and some of you actually found that that there was quite a lot that you really had to almost worry about and think about and and er yesterday for the first time of doing it with this this new method it does take quite a bit of thinking about and as we agreed practice is is what 's what 's important . .
297382:68	I particularly found the Aldershot method important because what it gives you is a clear structure to what you have to say when you stand up if you 're going to introduce by saying what you 're going to say before you expand and then at the end summarise and bring it all back to a nice conclusion .
297383:66	It actually gives you a framework on which to to base any any few words or any talk that you you have to give .
297433:37	The Aldershot principally because it gave a structure to what I had to say at least went up there fairly confident of what I had .
297434:29	The delivery because it gave me what I had to think about when I was up there language body language and then the playbacks I could look at the two things that Mike just highlighted as one and two .
297450:195	er the audience contact when you were actually stood up in the front and you 're there on your own just getting a little bit of feedback from the audience itself er does help and then the playback which erm I think it helped a lot to see how you faired particularly on that fir first attempt what areas you had to concentrate on to rectify your problems .
297513:122	So there 's there 's lots of reasons to illustrate the point then and another thing of course it does is if it 's one you use on here it helps you remember you do n't have to have that written down because it 's there already produced if it 's a pre-prepared acetate as we call as we call it .
297670:29	well , yeah , yeah , sorry to have to stop you again , but I think , with great respect one could , I think this point shorter , I 'm only putting it back to make sure
297805:12	mm which have to be , er , er I 'd heard it 's round about January sometime is that right ?
297815:208	erm , my Lord , in relation to that erm and er is an example , the European court itself and only the European court has the power to limit the direct effect of the provision , they can say well it has direct effect in these circumstances prospectively , but not retroactively and only the European court , that court alone has that power , all other courts , national courts must , my Lord this is your duty under article five I would submit to enforce article eighty five and three F
297831:76	say that you 're not allowed to , to run those because they 'd be contrary to the directive , but er we 'd have to wait and see
297871:151	and then Mr I think necessarily may be saying something the same as or , along the same lines as Mr and then Mr have er yet another go , I think it , that 's in which case I 'm not very satisfactory because er it means that Mr has got to reassemble his final remarks erm , twice
297877:20	er my Lord he 'll obviously have to make enquiries as to whether he can ask his next case to , to start
297903:71	So how we , so there was no obvious leader and how are we gonna pull ourselves ah ahead , well we have to improve our media coverage and we 've done quite a lot on that , John 's been very successful in getting quite a lot of media coverage both for individuals within the firm and for the the firm as a whole .
297916:9	So we have to er set out our stall there to form , first of all identify those target P L C 's which we really did want to get close to .
297939:56	It 's the same sort of cities commercial centre er let 's explore the opportunities , there must be a market place out there er and market place across the north of England must be vast when you think about all the pension funds that are connected to the er to the public companies .
297939:105	It 's the same sort of cities commercial centre er let 's explore the opportunities , there must be a market place out there er and market place across the north of England must be vast when you think about all the pension funds that are connected to the er to the public companies .
297956:9	so we must n't feel hurt , I 'd probably feel hurt we must n't be er adversely react if we do n't like the answers that we get .
297956:45	so we must n't feel hurt , I 'd probably feel hurt we must n't be er adversely react if we do n't like the answers that we get .
298010:21	Because they 're going to have to , at the end of their period of whether it 's a year or eighteen months , they will hopefully be qualified for a national vocational qualification level three and in order to gain that they have to be assessed constantly throughout their eighteen months , there 's no kind of
298010:132	Because they 're going to have to , at the end of their period of whether it 's a year or eighteen months , they will hopefully be qualified for a national vocational qualification level three and in order to gain that they have to be assessed constantly throughout their eighteen months , there 's no kind of
298011:177	That 's still not gonna , that 's still not gonna take us away from , you know , sorry there 's nobody on produce today , you 're gonna sorry training is out of the window today and maybe , maybe the department manager on produce , I dunno goes sick or something and he has to take over there for two or three weeks and it 's well do n't worry you know you 'll get back on to the training
298198:32	You 've got fifteen minutes in which the trainer has got to teach the person who 's making paper aeroplanes how to make them , alright , and tell them
298202:19	That 's something you have to explore for yourself .
298233:21	No , no , you do n't have to make one , using your aeroplane your prototype erm would you like to come and have a test flight .
298248:25	I think it is going to have to be a draw
298382:15	I think we must now move on , er yes Mr .
298386:242	Er Madam Speaker , I understand the position you ma you the point you make about er ministers det er determining whether they 're going to make a statement by an oral statement or by a written parliament question , but surely the speaker does have power if he or she so determines to summon er a minister here and particularly if there 's pressure in parliament to require a minister to come here and make a statement , that must be right .
298434:28	Designated accessible polling stations , er will themselves have to cover fifty percent or so of a constituency initially and people will be allowed to have access to a designated station if their own station is one that has not qualified at that time , although the aim will be a hundred percent designated er polling stations with full access .
298465:9	The committees had to work to a very tight timetable .
298480:91	Yes we could do so it would be a matter of judgement for the er er for the Home Secretary how far to take it and he would have to balance the likelihood of er other countries all ratifying and the inconvenience to those taking part in the election here er if er there is some uncertainty to the end and maybe having to revert to the current constituencies , er I hope and expect that these matters will be settled in the next few weeks .
298486:22	What price are we going to have to pay the French to get this through , really do n't know and I wonder if the minister could say , what exactly does do the French actually want before they agree to this ?
298489:197	Reced er the precedent for the situation that we are in now , yes indeed there is one and it was when er the Labour government was last in power in nineteen seventy eight , when we had er er er to er set up the European constituencies we had a limited time to do it in and all the countries in Europe had to agree to bring forward the same kind of agreement and put it into effect at the same time .
298495:119	Obviously we do not want to be in two minds up to the last day and he would n't do that but there is quite a a period of discretion where the time gets shorter and er he would have to make a judgement .
298518:34	To register to vote for example , a union citizen must have been resident in Great Britain on the qualifying date of the tenth of October or fifteenth of September for Northern Ireland in exactly the same way as British or other commonwealth citizens and citizens of other member states who wish to be candidates of the elections for the European parliament must conform to the same nomination procedures as candidates have hitherto .
298518:184	To register to vote for example , a union citizen must have been resident in Great Britain on the qualifying date of the tenth of October or fifteenth of September for Northern Ireland in exactly the same way as British or other commonwealth citizens and citizens of other member states who wish to be candidates of the elections for the European parliament must conform to the same nomination procedures as candidates have hitherto .
298522:36	The main difference from our normal arrangements is that union citizens will have to apply to register to vote and will have to do so to their local electoral registration officer by the twenty ninth of March .
298522:66	The main difference from our normal arrangements is that union citizens will have to apply to register to vote and will have to do so to their local electoral registration officer by the twenty ninth of March .
298530:106	Er , the European project goes on and for many of the newer generations in this place , it 's not longer an article of faith er but a part of the political landscape that has to be dealt with on merit and it 's all the more ludicrous therefore Mr Deputy Speaker , that the Conservatives ' internal divisions over Maastricht have led to a situation where candidates for the ever more important European elections are only now being selected in certain seats , just fourteen weeks before the election .
298532:89	As we argued throughout the proceedings of the European parliamentary elections bill , the Conservatives are entirely responsible for the fact that this process of drawing up the new European boundaries had to be compressed into such a short time .
298536:85	I think colleagues on this side will seek to press the minister even further on the latest developments in France and indeed what influence we can have to make sure that if we pass these orders today , they do become the basis of the European elections .
298540:7	We must be clear that this occasion must be the exception and not the rule .
298540:25	We must be clear that this occasion must be the exception and not the rule .
298545:105	boundary changes that we would like to have the full panoply of o o of inquiry a as the honourable gentleman knows , the the timetable was short here and what we had to do was to follow the model , er that had been provided by the last Labour government in seventy eight when it had a similarly tight timetable , took a similarly er er period , similarly short period of time er for the reviews and where erm the normal enquiries had to be dispensed with .
298545:258	boundary changes that we would like to have the full panoply of o o of inquiry a as the honourable gentleman knows , the the timetable was short here and what we had to do was to follow the model , er that had been provided by the last Labour government in seventy eight when it had a similarly tight timetable , took a similarly er er period , similarly short period of time er for the reviews and where erm the normal enquiries had to be dispensed with .
298602:60	I suppose in that context we should be grateful that ministers have not used the power that they have to modify the recommendations of the boundary committees .
298603:76	It is a sad day when we are grateful for not being abused in this house , but it 's about all we have to be thankful for until this wretched system is altered , root and branch .
298631:39	It would be difficult for me or for any other minister to have to defend leaving things unchanged in these other areas if the affect of having done so was subsequently to lead to a case of fraud in an investment firm , building society or insurance company which the existence of the duty would have helped to prevent .
298661:25	The auditing profession er argues , and I must say the audit practice board 's er er proposals are very , for very passive auditing , the audit profession argues that it 's difficult to detect fraud but on the other hand er the local government er act er local government finance act of nineteen eighty two requires local authority auditors to have er er er a duty to search for unlawful acts and report on them .
298663:157	So I think there are difficulties and I might er just finally add that were we to go along the lines he mentioned , we would of course need primary er legislation because we could n't introduce in orders under the relevant legislation this , so it would have to be a matter for another day , were we to er consider that seriously , but it is not the intention of the government .
298695:71	If we look at the insurance order and the one relating to building societies , it is quite clear there that the auditor has to be acting in his capacity o er as auditor .
298697:86	If that is the case why is it that the order relating to insurance and building society er building societies , specifically makes the point that the auditor must be working erm in his capacity as such whereas the orders on banking and financial services er it may be implicit the er the auditor is working er in his or her capacity as such er but it is not explicitly stated because the phraseology is different .
298700:49	Clearly it will be of crucial importance in any er court proceedings because the court will have to decide whether or not an auditor was in breech of his or her duty having regard to what is on the face of the statute .
298702:182	I know it could be something to do with regime er banks of course are supervised by the Bank of England at the moment and er the financial services er regime is supervised by the S I B and it could be that is the reason why it is not explicitly stated er that the accountant has to be acting in his capacity as erm as auditor .
298743:122	Now er I 'm thinking in in the case of er perhaps a young accountant advising on financial management who finds something odd and perhaps he reports it direct to the authorities , will he be covered or will he have to go through some procedure in order to bring himself within the protection ?
298749:115	What I think we 're saying on this side of the house , I do n't know if we 're saying it loud enough or it 's going to have effect , is that we must reduce the number of rules and regulations , you do n't actually need the body which the honourable member 's talking about .
298756:240	We er er erm in this country have a very bitter experience with B C C I , it was n't just the knock it took to the regulatory system but I need hardly remind this house there are thousands of people who lost everything they had and that and there are many people who lost everything they had and feel that this house has not taken their concern seriously and it 's something the minister must show that the government is willing to pursue these matters , even if it means introducing primary legislation .
298802:90	Order er the honourable gentleman seems to have forgotten my previous warning , we 're not discussing all manner of rules and regulations , we have four statutory instruments and he must address himself to those .
298806:109	May I remind the honourable member that there is no reason why he should not tear to pieces these four statutory instruments if that 's what he wishes , but that is what he must do not deal with all the others .
298819:198	They were speaking in favour of it , now here he comes along er and er we we 're I I find myself , regrettable I think because er er his er a minister very well informed in these areas with er who made in those committees a very powerful and effective contribution , now we find ourselves on the er opposite side but I have to say now that we are on opposite side that what is introducing today er is really er too little er and far too er too too late .
298833:57	What the government is proposing er is the bare minimum and because it 's so minimal you have to ask are they really serious er about dealing with the the kind of fraud that er lead er to this attempt to close the er stable door er after the er the the horse has has bolted .
298839:82	I indeed er in the er companies act in nineteen eighty nine the minister himself er argued that for any system to be effective there had to be a distance between regulators and regulations but the only people who have done any inquiry into B C C I which is the Institute er it itself is the mafia regulating the mafia auditors trying to regulate er the the auditors .
298862:10	Hence applications must be in by nine weeks time , nine weeks hence at the very least .
298875:100	It 's self evident Mr Deputy Speaker that this government is utterly unconcerned to carry out an obligation to which is bound by a treaty , freely entered into and the minister must answer the question of how he squares this inactivity with regulation nine three which obliges registration officers to take reasonable steps to obtain information about who should be eligible to appear on the electoral role .
298883:15	Mr Deputy Speaker I have to confess to you it is a matter of some indifference to me as to how many M E Ps were elect elect to the European parliament , er if eighty one is to be the new magic number well so be it .
298896:17	The er the er it has to be said on this side I suspect that the brevity of that speech was quite welcome , only because er I think er a number of us were n't altogether sure how how much time we would , we would get in this er debate after the front bench speaks , speeches .
298940:167	It is i i I I we have a wide range of changes that would flow out from that so you could n't just take a change to Cornwall which would then create an oversized Devon seat , I quite accept that and we 've argued from the first that this would have to be part of the review as a whole .
298948:21	The European union recognises that special regard must be taken er in respect of areas with strong regional identities .
298989:10	It will have to be for us at least twenty one days , that 's the absolute rock bottom minimum I would have thought therefore the French I suspect have us over a barrel and we would have to cough up for the enormous expenditure of an extra building at Strasbourg which is not needed erm as I understand it er that er view I savoured I do n't erm have the details of that .
298989:116	It will have to be for us at least twenty one days , that 's the absolute rock bottom minimum I would have thought therefore the French I suspect have us over a barrel and we would have to cough up for the enormous expenditure of an extra building at Strasbourg which is not needed erm as I understand it er that er view I savoured I do n't erm have the details of that .
298990:49	But Mr Deputy Speaker I sincerely hope these are the last erm boundary changes we have to debate .
298991:39	I mean it has been referred to that we might have to do them again , I sincerely hope we do n't have to go through this process again .
298991:77	I mean it has been referred to that we might have to do them again , I sincerely hope we do n't have to go through this process again .
299000:65	I just wanted to say three brief things about the boundaries , before doing so I think I may have to declare a personal interest .
299001:7	I have to tell the house I have in fact put my name forward to be considered as a candidate to stand to stand for Conservative
299023:7	I must insist we get back to the boundaries , I 've repeatedly had to do so this afternoon I would have thought it that the message would have got over to me honourable members before now .
299023:46	I must insist we get back to the boundaries , I 've repeatedly had to do so this afternoon I would have thought it that the message would have got over to me honourable members before now .
299027:74	But this particular case Mr Deputy Speaker what we want to know from the minister is on these new boundaries what do we actually have to do ?
299030:70	Now quite frankly Mr Deputy Speaker , if we want these new constituencies , including South Essex , it seems we 're going to have to say to the French they can have lots and lots of money to build lots and lots of new buildings for this rather ridiculous parliament and quite honestly Mr Deputy Speaker , members tonight in voting on the new boundaries will really have to decide what we want to do .
299030:202	Now quite frankly Mr Deputy Speaker , if we want these new constituencies , including South Essex , it seems we 're going to have to say to the French they can have lots and lots of money to build lots and lots of new buildings for this rather ridiculous parliament and quite honestly Mr Deputy Speaker , members tonight in voting on the new boundaries will really have to decide what we want to do .
299044:8	I must insist the honour honourable gentleman and interventions too should be in accordance with the with the debate and wi o o on the boundaries , so Teddy Taylor .
299089:145	Indeed the political parties preparing for those elections are in the process of selecting the candidates er there will in fact be an extra constituency in the East Midlands as a result of this particular order in council er and indeed the political parties at some stage will have to select new candidates for the six extra seats across the united kingdom .
299111:14	Now and er I have to point out to minister this side of the house er actually proposed much stronger provisions on er detection of fraud er in at the the building societies act and the financial services act er in in er er er of eighty six er we have these orders er brought in far too late because the government is continuing to place reliance on an industry and a framework which has a history er of of failure .
299121:10	Well I have to tell the minister that the firms are advertising for detection services all the time , K P M G Peter Marwick advertising this , they will er investigate financial frauds and rectify and recover from them that requires specialised accounting skills , K P M G forensic accounting offers experience in the techniques of fraudsters and the procedures er they may have followed .
299140:99	There 's a who er er a whole series of other reports , Bernhope and Fauder for instance , critical of er audit reports er report in in that context and I have to say to the minister er that none of the auditors criticised by D T I reports over the years have actually be disbarred from er from practice .
299143:7	We have to have er an effective control er and discipline er of auditors .
299146:16	For that reason we have to welcome er the er th th the orders , but they 're just not good enough .
299149:115	The point I I simply wanted to to make which is why I I sat through the debate , erm is the honourable member for Edinburgh Central er in his er speech er which I I must say I did expect , called for stronger regulations , er we had the argument the other week about whether there should be statutory regulations or whether we should make er the er self regulation system that we have with financial services industries work .
299162:7	It must be right for auditors to audit and for regulators to regulate and I do not think that it helps the argument for there to be an overlap in responsibilities and in some way , as I say , to turn auditors into snoopers and narks er er and make more supine one 's er regulators .
299190:102	Would he tell us then what he believes the impact of the er pay settlements will have on the spending he 's allowed local authorities because it seems to me there must either be a cut in staff er and a cut in services if they 're gonna keep within the the money that he made available at the time when he was n't aware of these settlements .
299314:44	Under any circumstances this would be difficult enough but this year Welsh local government has to suffer the commu the cumulative burden of previous years cuts .
299315:11	It also has to struggle with the social and economic consequences of the recession vested on the country by central government and of course it is expected this year to meet the costs of what is an unwanted and will be a costly and unsatisfactory reorganisation of local government .
299321:29	Well I I think that the honourable gentleman really must accept that er coming from a party which is er in office in er in the Welsh office and has er two hundred million , two hundred and eight million pounds I think unaccounted for last year , it really ill becomes him er to lecture , to lecture anybody .
299326:85	But of course , of course is if there is any evidence whatsoever er of financial mismanagement in the police authority it is a matter which has to be properly investigated .
299327:7	It has to be the subject of a proper report er by the er audit commission , but the district auditor and if they find that there has been er er wrong doing , if they find that there has been any er wilful neglect or if they find there has been any er unacceptable er maladministration then I will certainly join with the er the Secretary of State in condemning that .
299417:15	I think he has to I think he has to think very seriously before he starts to decry the achievements of this nation .
299417:34	I think he has to I think he has to think very seriously before he starts to decry the achievements of this nation .
299428:15	I believe we must give increasing opportunities to disabled people to get into work .
299502:35	National Westminster has announced four thousand redundancies and yet you still have to wait ages in the queue at the bank , why is that ?
299512:43	On average for every one hundred pounds in wages an employer in Britain must pay twenty pounds extra , in Germany thirty pounds and in France and Italy forty pounds .
299520:10	Well I have to say I 'm amazed at the honourable gentleman asking that question .
299521:56	If he had his way , and we signed up for the social chapter , those extra costs would have to be met out of those pay packets and there 'd be even less for people to take in wages so the honourable gentleman should n't be complaining about low pay when he wants to add to the costs of employment along with the rest of his party .
299523:175	Does my honourable friend agree with Klaus Stratzenburg who is a supervisor with Black and Decker in Lindburg in Germany who when asked to comment as to why he felt that Black and Decker were closing their plant in Germany to move it to Spennymore in County Durham , said it 's simple industry must be flexible , the social chapter is n't .
299571:17	But as the Lord President must be aware my honourable friend , the Shadow Chief Secretary , has questions tabled to this government about the extra taxes people will pay in nineteen ninety five to which an answer is not being provided .
299572:9	The government must have the figures , we know the government has the figures and the people of Britain will have to pay that extra tax so why have n't they got the guts to tell them how much they 'll have to pay .
299572:65	The government must have the figures , we know the government has the figures and the people of Britain will have to pay that extra tax so why have n't they got the guts to tell them how much they 'll have to pay .
299572:132	The government must have the figures , we know the government has the figures and the people of Britain will have to pay that extra tax so why have n't they got the guts to tell them how much they 'll have to pay .
299590:27	Madam Speaker I r the er honourable gentleman must have a rather er curious source for his statistics because what has actually happened is not merely that the government have protected the real value of the state retirement pension but the combination of our policies both in social security , in the pensions field and in the economic world have led to a position in which pensioners average real incomes have risen more than forty percent since this government took office .
299673:72	Mr Deputy Speaker , er i you will have observed that the two front benches have spoken at incredible length and you have had to reprimand them , or certainly the opposition for er going away from the subject matter and do you not er believe that it would have been far better to allow some back benchers to get .
299690:85	If the French do not ratify these proposals as may appear likely now er how late can the minister leave it before he informs the people that they must fight the European elections on the old boundaries and not the new ?
299702:16	Which system we would have to decide , who draws up the list er would the list be a U K one , a regional one or would it be one in the separate countries that go to make up the U K. A huge amount of discussion there , not a chance missed at all , er he wanted a separate seat for for Cornwall .
299762:11	It really must be be for the churches and the families themselves to go much further and to instruct if that is the er what the Noble Lord is hinting at , at erm promoting belief .
299769:74	Does the Noble Minister not agree that this area of education is absolutely central to our future as a stable multi-cultural society and that therefore teachers must have in depth knowledge of the traditions and faiths with which they 're dealing .
299798:28	Is the Noble Baroness aware that a National Library must grow .
299802:57	My Lords , Government is not prepared to retain the land itself for the future development of what must be regarded as one of the world 's greatest libraries .
299832:140	Er the Government find it absolutely unacceptable for people to wait on trolleys , once the decision for admission has been made er but My Lords sometimes it is necessary to wait er for observation purposes or sometimes for diagnostic treatments , er which actually have to take place in the A and E department er but My Lords it 's very interesting to see how similar hospitals vary , even within the same vicinity and we believe a great deal of this is due to poor management .
299836:102	has the Minister er studied the Royal College of Nursing Report which was published early last month , which shows that in a third of accident and emergency units in hospitals , patients actually have to stay overnight er before they are admitted to er a ward and would she a accept that this really is not a satisfactory situation , it 's actually worse i outside London than it is in London , contrary to some views .
299838:42	Is not this really a situation to which er she and her colleagues must er address their mind ?
299840:89	that report er that i it was er said that it m a high proportion of the cases were because of bed closures , which surely must be linked with resources .
299844:102	My Lords , I think I made it perfectly clear what I did mean er I did qualify it by saying that of course there are times when patients do have to wait on trolleys for diagnostic purposes , for observation and for other reasons er but once an admission has been agreed , then that patient should be admitted , that is our policy and that is what we 're working towards .
299928:13	In addition they had to investigate three hundred and eighty eight sexual offences , nine hundred and twenty eight robberies , three thousand and ninety seven burglaries , two thousand eight hundred and sixty two cases of fraud and thirty seven thousand five hundred and eighty two cases of theft .
299936:59	Presumably the rest of the police service overburdened with er investigations of crime as they are , will have to carry the burden caused by the Department of Transport 's errors .
299938:57	Next , has the Association of Chief Police Officers yet been told that as from April they will have to take on this burden of work which has been removed from the British Transport Police as a result of an error in a Government Bill .
299940:78	I am sure the Government will appreciate the indignation that they will feel overburdened as they are with work , that they will now have to use their scarce resources to deal with criminal conduct arising on the railways and lastly , who is going to pay for this work ?
299941:107	The Department of Transport has made a serious error , can we be assured that police authorities will receive financial compensation for the work that their forces are now havin have are going to have to carry out and there is a further matter which I have erm drawn to the attention of the Secretary of State for Transport in er correspondence , namely the need to establish a new and representative police authority for the British Transport Police .
299961:120	I would just tell him this that er there is a problem here which my Right Honourable Friend is addressing and depending on the outcome of those consultations and discussions , will obviously depend the action which we will have to take .
299974:75	I did ask whether the Association of Chief Police Officers have been told that they are going to they are likely to have to take over many of the responsibilities of the British Transport Police as from the first of April .
299976:185	I hope the Noble Earl will be able to give me an answer in perhaps in correspondence following this , also the date upon which at they were informed , because I am sure he will realise the implications as far as the rest of the British Police Service are concerned that as from April of this year they will have to take on a heavy burden of work which is now being carried out by the British Transport Police .
299985:60	My Lords , the move amendment which is down in my name on the Order Paper , I do have to apologise Your Lordships , to your Lordships , if th if it 's meaning is not immediately clear , even to the keen minds which are present in Your Lordship 's House .
299999:121	I have always had very limited sympathy with what is rather mis misdescribed in my er er view , as industrial action , but there is one in history , one instance of industrial action with which I must tell Your Lordships I feel an increasing sympathy .
300005:30	And I do , and I do , I must say not for the last time during the passage of this Bill , I do feel constrain to offer my very deep sympathy to my Noble Friend on the front bench .
300012:131	I do not speak of the substance of the matter because so many of us have some doubts about the substance of it and we shall come to that later , but erm it does seem to me that er we had to get rid of erm sections two , two A and three of the Police Act nineteen sixty four as amended and that clearly doing so here and erm er er I I think that this is an improvement as a result on the laws that er present appears on the Statute Book .
300056:48	We welcome the proposals by the Government as far as they go , but we have to point out that those proposals leave police authorities in an unstable situation .
300063:33	My Lords , any discussion of this group of amendments must surely be conducted against the background of the vital Amendment thirty-one concerning the Chairman of the police authorities .
300073:35	Against the background of the changes proposed to the Government we have to consider the members of the authority and the appointment of some members .
300074:7	I must make it clear at once that I personally do not regard these particular decisions as a constitutional question such as most certainly was the appointment of the chairman .
300077:59	I do not say that in any criticism of the existing police authorities , my experience as Home Secretary I have to admit now some ten years ago was that on the whole they did a very good job , but I do now accept that the importance of law and order today demands a broad approach and possibly some new ideas .
300081:12	However , I must at this stage part from Amendment eleven on the method of their selection for two reasons .
300101:147	I I 'm certainly not My Lords er un er er an unqualified admirer of all our procedures in local Government , but I do believe that before central Government is further down the road of , of erm usurping functions which are now those of local government it has to persuade a large number of people that its own performance justifies such a course and myself I do n't believe it does .
300109:259	As regards size , to come to the second point , the Government amendments still seem to contemplate that sixteen should be the norm er but in practice , I would expect a great many exceptions to be made where for example there are number of constituent authorities er as in Greater Manchester er where there 's er a combination of urban areas and large rural areas , or where the authority tends to function through a lot of sub-committees each of which have to be manned as in Greater Man as in Merseyside .
300110:185	I am bound to say My Lords that my own view is still that the size within the limits laid down by statute with a minimum of sixteen or eighteen and maximum of twenty-four would best be determined locally and if we 're not going in for a national police force , I still ca n't see what it has to do with the Secretary of State and why the Home Office should be settling the size of forty-three or so police authorities .
300156:24	and er that I think the House must recognise .
300169:30	My Lords in a few minutes the House will have to vote on this issue .
300170:7	I must tell the House it is probably one of the most momentous in the history of the British Police Service .
300302:103	The original objective was to liberate South Korea , it then began to unite Korea but if you raise the objective to an assault on China proper then , then you would have to quote General Ridgeway , who was a commander on the spot , er you 'd be fighting the wrong war , the wrong time and in the wrong place .
300313:34	In nineteen sixty one , prior to the crisis , the Americans had to face the rather humiliating settlement in Laos by which they accepted a communist erm er government , or at least a government which had communist members , erm Kennedy wanted to intervene in Laos but again was restrained by his British ally , MacMillan would n't in fact accept er that we should get involved in a ground war in Indo-China .
300339:104	No one asked that question , they simply focused upon er the , the communist insurrection in the south and the American , American commitment to the global containment of communism meant that they had to go and do something about it and domestic political pressures were there too er President Kennedy came out of the Cuban missiles crisis a hero because his people mistakenly believed that he 'd won a foreign policy success and that he 'd acted in a restrained and statesmanlike manor .
300340:57	Well regardless of the hyperbole and the rhetoric , in fact it was an American defeat er he had to accept the existence of a communist regime in Cuba and to keep his hands off it .
300341:29	Now in the case of Vietnam , a decision had to be made to intervene or not to intervene .
300343:125	What limits would be placed , and Kennedy was very acutely conscious of the big mistake that Truman had made in Korea in , in fact , seeking to extend the intervention and bringing China into the war under no circumstances must China be allowed to take that step in the case of Indo-China .
300370:189	Er there are interests all over an and some er have a higher value er er and some have a lower value but they are all related erm so it 's not possible to regard er a contest solely as an isolated advers adversarial struggle where you 're weighing up the rel the relative forces , the relative military capabilities that exist , you have to consider a whole range of political , economic and strategic effects of , of your , your , your action .
300402:106	And so you have then a political system in which you , which you have a presidency er faced by a powerful legislature , a president who is not part of legislature but who has to lead the legislature without any significant controls over it a very difficult and demanding task .
300403:7	It has to be persuasion because he has few , if any , powers of coercion unlike the British prime minister .
300421:7	We must have one lawyer amongst our presence surely .
300423:7	There has to be evidence produced to say why you are being detained and you have a chance to , to refute that evidence .
300427:105	He goes on to say of course federal laws were not being obeyed in the confederacy because they 'd rejected the entire panoply of federal laws and Lincoln goes on to point out must they these laws and the confederacy be allowed to to state the question more directly , are all the laws but one to go unexecuted and the government itself to go to pieces less that one be violated .
300433:85	Now here we move in to a bit of Plato always be aware of those who argue by analogy by general law life and limb must be protected yet often a limb must be amputated to save a life can you guess what 's coming next ? but a life is never wisely given to save a limb .
300433:106	Now here we move in to a bit of Plato always be aware of those who argue by analogy by general law life and limb must be protected yet often a limb must be amputated to save a life can you guess what 's coming next ? but a life is never wisely given to save a limb .
300566:104	But there is also a common interest in the world of preserving fishing stock , not over fishing so that in fact you get the depletion of fishing stock , and therefore somehow you have to balance between your particular interests and the common interests .
300568:50	Well perhaps the technological advances we 've seen mean our capacity to handle things has had to expand .
300583:51	In southern Africa several of the states have no coastline , Zambia Zimbabwe Malawi Swaziland so they have to depend upon other countries for access erm to the coast , and that means their transport patterns are very very dependent upon others .
300622:12	Well I 'll have to accept that I do n't know where that came from but I 've got down here state 's interest
300735:69	Erm now I know that most of you have memorized the constitution but because I suffer from Alzheimer 's I had to bring mine with me to remind myself erm what the constitution says about the , the powers of the presidency .
300788:121	The president is not free to choose , to start wars wherever he feels like it , the president is not free to make agreements with any country he feels like making it with and some presidents have had to learn the hard way .
300794:14	You do n't have to read the book , it 's rubbish , but I mean you can just say , if you remember the title , The Imperial Presidency , here was a view that the presidency had become dominant , the presidency had grown out of all proportion to the intentions of the founding fathers and needed to be reined back .
300830:148	Here is a man , he 's commander in chief , he 's the president of the United States he 's faced with a , a recalcitrant and difficult general who was sabotaging the purposes of his campaign , extending the campaign beyond proper limits and the president has to show who 's boss , and he showed him who 's boss and he sacked him , great , presidential power in action .
300855:73	And only if certain conditions are met , I would argue or as Richard Newstat argued and I agree with him so he must be right , erm the first is that in this decision the president 's involvement was unambiguous unambiguous , there was no question about it that here you had the president directly , personally involved in a one to one communication .
300868:114	And what happened in practice was simply the Turkish government made representations to the State Department and said hey , you know , these bases , they provide a lot of work , you know , we have to provide empl alternative employment for these people so could we phase out this withdrawal over say a three year programme ?
300923:7	You have to persuade people and persuasion is a constant process and so Clinton is permanently engaged in persuading people to do the things they ought to have the sense to do without him persuading them .
300930:23	Shall I stand , I do n't have to stand do I ?
300933:89	Er , she 's got quite tough at T N T , being quite new to it , but er , she 's got it even harder because she has to work with me , but er , she doing very well with B M A system .
301065:7	We had to start again
301070:68	And I think that perhaps we 've all learned a lesson from it , plus the fact that you 've er , had to climb out of an horrendous accident , but the fact that if you are still drinking at half past four in the morning , the last thing you should do at nine o' clock in the morning is get in the car and drive the damn thing .
301073:47	I , I , I 'm , I am absolutely mortified , because , I have to say I think that erm , I got in the car , I do n't have very far to drive from the N E C , erm , twenty minutes and I 'm home , but I go on the M 1 motorway and er , and I never gave it very much thought , and on Monday when I was told Dave , what had happened , erm , there but for the grace of God .
301093:74	Well erm , I think it 's going to certainly erm , create one or two thoughts , and I think we have to recognise that
301101:46	Good about everything , good salesmen , erm , but I think we do have to take er , Jack 's thoughts on that , that really perhaps we are begging the question when we , just forget ourselves and keep going till three , four o' clock in the morning whatever it is , and then we 'll get in the car and drive home .
301199:19	Erm , what we have to do is to look at , if you like , the way in which A , we can improve what we do erm , and see if we ca n't get more out of the two of you than we do currently , I 'm sure you 'll enjoy what we 're doing .
301238:7	It has to break
301305:71	You know , I mean we revert a lot of trade here to next day , so the quality of service has got to be good or we lose them .
301312:10	, it must be carriage free , , said to these fell on Superman .
301313:13	Well they had to do , , and everybody 's got here that he 's a , he 's engaged , and there , and I mean I know I 've used doing my scribble , but here 's a little spout here like that and it 's got a tap on it , and that 's what it is .
301317:57	Well that , that 's what I 'm saying is that , I think what we have to start doing and I 'm not suggesting you 're not doing , but I just want to talk about this in , before we practically kick off on the course proper , I think what , I mean that comes off , and then the oil starts dripping out of it , and the minute the oil starts dripping out , then we become quite a good artist are n't we ?
301363:205	Now some of you , if you 've only been with the company a few months or whatever it was , may not have noticed too much of a change , er , but I 've noticed a bit of a ch , I 've noticed a tremendous change in two and half months , two and a half years , and there 's some people in the room who must have noticed tremendous changes .
301389:204	So that when you introduce yourself , you are seen as a haulier , was the phrase you used , er , and we , we 'd all need to spend an awful lot of time and an awful lot of effort into raising ourselves above that image , I mean there 's nothing wrong with being a haulier , all I 'm saying is that we have to raise ourselves above that image .
301400:39	Some of the people who had suddenly become saleswomen , they had to go , because they could n't cope with that .
301402:70	And the other thing that 's happened of course , is that the tw , the , the indoor and the outdoor have had to start spending more time working together and think together , and indeed being measured together , because you 're now measured as a team are n't you ?
301441:166	Not doubling it , not trebling it , but to improve it by something like five or ten percent , and then the next time we go to a sales conference , you 'll be the ones winning the prizes , instead of the people who 've to be winning the prizes , because you 'll not have to improve it by much to win the prizes do you ?
301506:14	It 's a must really is n't it ?
301538:124	Yes , alright , yes , I mean I have n't done it like that , I 've got to analyse it through green , when I actually was aware that I was stopping doing my B M S and had to do something else for whatever reason .
301540:186	I mean one day , I mean I was in a customer care meeting for three hours on Monday , so obviously I lost some there , but you know , that particular day I was on a , just on the phone personally on my B M S for just over three hours , and just looking at the other things that I had to deal with .
301563:24	Yes , we had drivers that had to do sort of timed deliveries or whatever in the morning , and they , so basically that was the time .
301626:107	I know there 's a motorway running down the middle but you ca n't over or under it , for thirty miles there , so if you 've got to get across there , you have to do this , come all out , you know , and that is an hour 's run .
301633:247	Yes , you see the thing is one appointment can cock up your whole system , because if it like you said , if one , if a customer does happen to call in and say , look I need somebody in here desperately , when do you want it , when it 's smack in the middle , it 's not the other side of the world , but you know he 's in Nuneaton or something , well you still have to go out and see him .
301677:63	Where if you 're fairly new , you do n't know them people , you might be thinking you have to have a timed appointment to go in with , where you 'll save a lot of time by just building up , and working on your existing like that .
301718:42	If things do n't give way before tomorrow I 'm going to have to , it 's bloody half past seven when I get home , and I want to be in the pub you see , but whatever , all these things happen .
301740:34	That what happens after the first ten minutes , you have to go and do something else , then what happens , you physically get up and do , but you will do something else .
301803:12	What we have to do is start looking at all the things that make that possible and try and do something else for all the things that do n't help you fill it .
301848:8	You have to be careful , you ca n't actually say that Nick represents this or that , you have to say that George thinks that he represents and sort of a kind of genetic engineering which would turn out a generation of perfect people , alright .
301848:64	You have to be careful , you ca n't actually say that Nick represents this or that , you have to say that George thinks that he represents and sort of a kind of genetic engineering which would turn out a generation of perfect people , alright .
301888:9	do we have to conclude from if it was a play about the Cold War , what is the conclusion of it ?
302044:84	I just ca n't buy it , I 'm sorry but if the author is going to put elements , a political element into it , he must be steering the audience towards something , because why bother putting all these points up , because everybody realises , what the cold war is
302063:17	As Tim said you have to hold on to the fact that these are real characters and their in a kind of confrontational situation here are n't they ?
302203:10	I 'll have to look it up .
302228:47	In other words sex can be great fun , you do n't need to have to do it in order to just have babies .
302408:7	I must find out some time .
302460:12	It does n't have to be .
302461:14	It does n't have to be , why does n't it have to be ?
302461:36	It does n't have to be , why does n't it have to be ?
302463:17	Well it just does n't have to be .
302476:12	It does n't have to be .
302477:13	It does n't have to be a fox out there , it does n't have to be a forest .
302477:44	It does n't have to be a fox out there , it does n't have to be a forest .
302478:9	Does n't have to be in the countryside .
302488:96	At one time he lived in Devon I think and he also has association with Yorkshire , so that is could be quite probably in the countryside but it does n't have to be a forest , does n't have to be a fox out there but he does actually say I imagine this midnight moment 's forest .
302488:121	At one time he lived in Devon I think and he also has association with Yorkshire , so that is could be quite probably in the countryside but it does n't have to be a forest , does n't have to be a fox out there but he does actually say I imagine this midnight moment 's forest .
302552:14	he would n't have to see it , he could just know it 's there but then why does he say , I imagine it
302570:65	Yes there is something outside his window , however near or far and it is alive but he does n't have to be seeing it and on the other hand something is alive in the room because actually if you look at the context of that , something else is alive beside the clock 's loneliness and the blank page where my fingers move .
302661:10	We 'll have to see what that means in a minute .
302798:24	Yes , now this shows it must be his imagination , must n't it ?
302798:37	Yes , now this shows it must be his imagination , must n't it ?
302916:44	No , it 's just that erm he feels comfortable and does n't have to put on a show
303045:16	Miss and Tony you have to kinda pretend that they do like each other so that erm the mother does n't suspect her of liking Hastings .
303100:15	Erm what you have to avoid is just divide into three ?
303229:35	Erm discussing why Alexander is , I think he has to be a bit harsh or satirical as erm .
303352:27	behave think of them as less than have to does n't it
303484:32	If you wanna pick it up God , you must have good eyesight .
303490:7	It must be
303540:75	As we did in the example before Now there 's a bit of erm recreational or diversional mathematics coming up which you do n't have to understand but for those of you who are keen on it , it 's there .
303548:17	Well , you 're gonna have to take something on trust already .
303562:45	I drew the diagram and they were positively correlated Now , you do n't have to know that proof but if you ever wonder where it comes from or you wanna tell your grandchildren one day Mummy , what did you do in the stats classes ?
303593:57	For example , you could actually work out all the Z scores but this equation you do n't have to , but you could if you wanted to .
303614:15	Now it does n't have to necessarily be the same subject but in some way it 's a repeated measures , that 's where you .
303652:64	I said there 's y' know it was a couple of minutes late and they said erm it had to be processed through the proper channels .
303653:47	Waste of my time for an hour , waste of whoever 's gonna have to sit on the committee for even more , ridiculous .
303657:17	They said it all had to be processed so it 's gonna have to go bef but I mean I will get very angry if that gets taken any further cos it 's ridiculous , is n't it ?
303657:46	They said it all had to be processed so it 's gonna have to go bef but I mean I will get very angry if that gets taken any further cos it 's ridiculous , is n't it ?
303665:23	You 're the only ones who have to do the essay for perception .
303689:87	In other words you can have what goes on in the brain at the hardware level does or at the level of nuance does n't necessarily have to correlate with what goes on at a high level description .
303745:18	So any feature analyser would have to deal with context so therefore they started to look at the role of context and we 're gonna look at contextual effects later on , probably next week or the week after .
303751:191	They 've each got ideally a circle and a line so they have identical features but they 're different letters so clearly , I mean it 's quite obvious , it 's not only the features present but also their relationship to the other features that 're present that determines what type of letter is recognised So any model of perception would have to take that into account .
303754:23	So , a feature analyser would also have to take into account the overall shape of the letters so it 's becoming a bit more complicated already in terms of the model that would have to account for it .
303754:106	So , a feature analyser would also have to take into account the overall shape of the letters so it 's becoming a bit more complicated already in terms of the model that would have to account for it .
303761:32	We 're gonna look at psychology and what they had to say about , or the school had to say about perception .
303761:57	We 're gonna look at psychology and what they had to say about , or the school had to say about perception .
303841:93	them on the floor and watch them shatter into natural pieces , di dum di dum di dum , in the absence of such a direct technique , more indirecti more indirect alternatives must b must suffice .
303841:99	them on the floor and watch them shatter into natural pieces , di dum di dum di dum , in the absence of such a direct technique , more indirecti more indirect alternatives must b must suffice .
303867:20	So how far away did you have to put them before you no longer saw the interference ?
303910:24	I do n't know , I 'll have to think about it .
304141:42	If you 've got an idea or a message to send it has to be encoded in some way then there 's various mediums or media by which it can be transmitted but it 's got to be decoded by the receiver for the idea or message to be understood , and there 's some kind of feedback mechanism potentially from the receiver to the sender .
304177:14	We 've all had to wait for doctors and dentists , yeah ?
304199:55	Erm , i there 's y' know construct architecture as any other form of er communication that must be quite an interesting thing to do .
304243:24	Erm , if you may not have had to do this , you may have to in the future .
304243:45	Erm , if you may not have had to do this , you may have to in the future .
304267:7	You must have thought of some more than that .
304276:63	I think I think er these days people take er take baths and showers quite often and you have to be pretty close to somebody before you smell them I guess , I mean I hope you do anyway .
304468:51	The exam paper 's two hours , there 'll be six questions on it and you will have to do three essays , right ?
304472:42	Right , if you 've gotta do three essays now from six you have to do one from each section , then you 're gonna do either two of developmental , o it 's unclear exactly what the breakdown will be on that . .
304475:54	Now , from my point of view of course , all do developmental so I do n't have to mark the papers , right ?
304600:123	The only time I 've ever frozen in an exam was when I 'd gone for three exams solid without kip , one after the other , and I just brain and the other ones were a real struggle and I had to graft my marks out of solid granite y' know I was chiselling away .
304603:55	And I could n't remember it was forty four and my mind went totally blank and I had to walk out of the exam for over half an hour with a and I could n't remember a thing and went back in .
304652:12	It does n't have to be academically rigorous .
304679:46	So y w feel free now to ask questions I mean , you must have something that worries you about about this partic I can only really talk about the exam .
304690:19	It 's you do n't have to be an Einstein to critically evaluate something .
304736:69	The Skinner seminar , as far as I can remember , you 've gotta bear in mind I I mean it must be eight nine years ago I probably read Skinner in earnest , yeah ?
304751:121	What you do is , you look at the environment and consider like the inputs and then you look at behaviour as outputs and you learn the relationship between the two and you do n't neces you do n't have to understand what goes on inside .
304786:18	I 'm sure you must have some Who 's n I mean ho I pres how many of you have come in here without on A levels that did n't require you to write an essay ?
304802:26	I have felt embarrassed because I 've had to meet people afterwards who I who I who I care what they think about me and I 've put in the biggest load of old rubbish .
304830:77	Erm , the trouble is , if you do n't know the vocabulary it 's very hard to dictate and write down because you have to keep stopping and asking them to spell things .
304840:14	The problem I must admit the problem that surprised me with overheads is that erm people ca n't write and listen at the same time , or the other thing is , you put something on an overhead th every bit of it gets written down which is why I adapted it so that you did .
304986:13	So it will have to be in for Thursday of that week , so you 've got another couple of days in that first week back .
304996:46	Erm , so the editorial task each each time is exactly the same , you had to rewrite the extract in modern standard English , and then comment on any differences , and explain why those differences occurred , but they are quite often , erm , eighteenth or nineteenth century extracts from books , descriptions of things , erm , dialect , descriptions of of events , and things like that , and last year 's one , on , the one of last year 's paper was er , a middle English one .
304998:55	So it 's it 's vital that you get this exercise right and it , and you must n't just think of it as part of the study of History of Language , it 's not , it 's , it 's a er a definite part of your course .
305134:14	What do I have to do , just say it
305186:18	So the process that you have to carry out , then is to find a way of transferring your literal translation once you 've worked out word for word what is being said , into terms which mean something to a modern reader or , listener .
305187:25	But the other important element is that you have to reflect the style of the original , look at the notes I 've made at the bottom of the page , please .
305190:146	You actually have a sense of style , there are three different sections to that description and you have , and there is actually some repetition involved erm , by by starting each , by by this reference to the sight , the smell , the touch , and you have to , and and that 's the kind of sty stylistic element that you have to incorporate into your version and I put a note at the bottom too , that there are times when you ca n't totally update this kind of work .
305190:191	You actually have a sense of style , there are three different sections to that description and you have , and there is actually some repetition involved erm , by by starting each , by by this reference to the sight , the smell , the touch , and you have to , and and that 's the kind of sty stylistic element that you have to incorporate into your version and I put a note at the bottom too , that there are times when you ca n't totally update this kind of work .
305430:43	So , can you listen to this please , erm , you have to finish in your heads now .
305436:12	It does n't have to be in every day speech patterns .
305437:40	If it 's a fairly formal written thing , but there , it has got to use word ordering , grammar , punctuation , vocabulary which are those , which are presently used .
305654:12	But you do have to , you do have to be aware of being too clever for your own good , because they only want a translation .
305654:30	But you do have to , you do have to be aware of being too clever for your own good , because they only want a translation .
305672:8	They must of , how else , what else .
305685:73	You have , you have taken the word evaporated out of the air , and it 's it 's an assumption , you must cross that out .
305819:23	But again , I emphasize , it must be sold in the right situation .
305871:59	If you 're not buying it now , you ca n't have a Mortgage Master , so therefore , you must have a P S P .
305935:73	The question that I would raise with this plan , is Mr client , what bills do you have each month that must be paid , no matter what ?
305962:29	National Insurance , and all the other bits that must be paid , okay .
305966:24	So from your income , that we must have , says we can do all those things , and have our standard of living .
305968:21	What bills now do n't we have to pay anymore .
306155:7	You have to be off for a while to receive that , or straight away .
306263:49	But if the housewife is unable to perform her duties , what 's the husband gonna have to do ?
306342:121	You know , if they could n't go and be a brick-layer , but they could sit at home , and you know , stick stamps on envelopes , or whatever , earn some money , then they might have to do that because they have n't got this plan .
306349:14	Housewives definition she must be confined to her home , or that of a recognised medical institution .
306350:16	So the doctor 's definition must say , yes , she 's confined to home , because of , the incapacity , whatever it may be , or she 's actually gone to a recognised medical institution , hospital , nursing home , whatever it may be .
306405:15	Yes , you actually have to write the plan to fifty-five .
306652:40	Also taking into account any other P H I benefits we must do as well .
306698:9	Do they have to produce a doctor 's note say look , I 've been off for
306748:14	But again , there must be a loss of income , because again , there 's the rule , that you ca n't be better off by being off work sick .
307039:23	That 's the first equation , you must it this way , cos any other way will not be accurate .
307040:20	But the first thing you must do , once you know the figure , take seventy- five per cent of it , if it 's up to forty-five thousand and obviously these are .
307055:37	Okay , so they 've other P H I benefit , that must come off of the equation , because we , otherwise we 'll be paying it as well as another insurance company , which mean he 'll be better off financially , by being off work sick , yes .
307064:12	What we must then take off is the single person 's state invalidity benefit
307083:176	it has n't cropped up here , but I understand that in other cases where you 've double insurance from two life companies , that two life companies would split the actual benefit fifty-fifty , so it would n't actually be deducting the whole amount , would it , because Abbey Life would still ha , Abbey Life would still have to pay
307184:7	He had to bring football into it did n't he ?
307248:48	Well , if you 're doing a erm , a rockumentary about them , somebody must mind , must n't they .
307248:56	Well , if you 're doing a erm , a rockumentary about them , somebody must mind , must n't they .
307253:9	Some somebody must be interested , otherwise we would n't be doing this theoretically .
307295:19	But they 've got to have to be consistent ,
307435:27	But for the sake , I think we have to make an exception , perhaps in Joe 's case , because he actually is a musician as well .
307498:9	yeah , have to have the whole group there .
307519:53	Yeah , well , whereas in that , if they they when the recording the demo they have to be together , do n't they .
307805:46	Erm , I can remember or orders and prices at work that I have to do .
307897:36	You could tell each other about this , you do n't have to tell me .
307925:110	They did n't want to drive , but they did , they learnt to drive , but they they said they never really wanted to do it , but only if they really really had to do it .
307935:31	Er , it 's it 's you do n't have to be frightened of letting me know this , because , it it stands to reason , that it 's going to happen , okay .
307959:7	They have to attend enormous numbers of operations and watch experts doing it .
307988:9	Do we have to talk about that word , really .
308031:64	You share the information you got , but you talk about it , and you hear what other people have got to say .
308215:7	We had to
308282:55	One minute We 're welcome to collaborate with the person next to you , you do n't have to do it in splendid isolation .
308380:9	Do n't have to , though .
308889:68	Well I thought I was adequately , adequately provided for the er future but obviously I 'm not , I 'll have to bump that up a little bit .
308927:8	You have to be careful with Dave , he 's a little bit er touchy at times
308975:79	you to do is er give me his telephone number so that I er contact him , offer the same service to him as I have to you .
308976:27	Yeah certainly I would do but I must admit I do n't really like er giving people 's phone numbers out , I do n't know how he 'd react to , you know , somebody ringing him up and
309473:116	Does she agree that this non-controversial form has a er essential role to continue er in Cambridge and that erm the the issues of safety , environment and the promotion of low cost schemes is something that must be preserved ?
309474:20	Yes I know you 'll have to with me .
309485:10	Well I must say Mr Mayor I was gratefully assured by the answer that councillor gave earlier on about the er strenuous efforts the council is making to improve the security at the Kingsway cash point as I now gather it 's called .
309489:129	Now I understand er that you know we are providing public service here and we have got allow for public access but the cost of the council of having all its officers outside of this building for over er two hours must have been absolutely horrendous and I would have thought this would be an area where improving security ought to be a high priority so what are you going to do about it ?
309662:47	I 'd like to put one simple note and I think it 'll have to be simple for him to understand it but I would like to put one simple notion to him and that is that there is great merit in having public services sharing by people from all social classes .
309666:10	You really must withdraw this motion .
309669:7	I must say to those of you who tend we had nice interview
309696:16	Well I I actually must have read completely different to anybody else from what I 've been hearing , erm the way I looked at it , the situation that we have locally compared with what David was saying about the national erm what government are doing nationally and the situation we have here in Cambridge city .
309700:35	We 've got a problem now , w we have to try and s split that between our problems here in the city and what will happen in the future and what the government will intend to do about the problem .
309720:12	Th this company must be in a bloody sight worse a mess than we thought and the government are not letting us know this is what they 're look for are scapegoats and they they 're .
309742:7	I must say one thing .
309743:76	One of the great advantages of the advent of councillor and councillor to this council is in fact because of the motions which , I have to say even nine times out of ten I do n't agree with a word of , or even ninety nine times out of a hundred I do n't agree with a word of what have we been talking about this last three quarters of an hour , housing , yeah .
309760:45	We have on our a a a as councillor er er erm was saying must earlier on her piece , sixty six to seventy five percent of people housed are homeless anyway and will be housed because of that situation .
309767:71	You might have ageing parents who you support and god knows how much other outgoings which are hidden and then you have to go down that road and say that you 're going to look at at financial status you 're going to have to say and exactly what are all of your outgoings in and now down going to get real unpleasant intrusion into people 's business .
309767:141	You might have ageing parents who you support and god knows how much other outgoings which are hidden and then you have to go down that road and say that you 're going to look at at financial status you 're going to have to say and exactly what are all of your outgoings in and now down going to get real unpleasant intrusion into people 's business .
309800:13	Unfortunately council leaders have to leave .
309868:13	Because the county has to make a decision on the road closure so therefore it should go to rather than .
309896:156	That much sooner and in the last hour , couple of hours we 've seen what I would call a Tweedledee and Tweedledum amendments erm because quite frankly there is n't that much difference between them er at the end of the day the impact on the people who 've had to pay the bill is virtually the same .
309899:54	Because of course we did put er these proposals , most of these proposals until we 've had to erm at the board meeting er and we did give them full publicity in the Cambridge Evening News a couple of weeks ago .
309913:70	The argument about the contingency fund erm I find that amazing that er y' know , up until a few hours ago you had to have two hundred thousand pounds .
309916:75	I do n't think we ought to provide it because that just means it gives the wrong impression to the officers I have to say .
309943:53	Alright , fair enough , you accepted what we 've been saying for ages that we had to go to voluntary competitive tendering right .
309949:55	The final point is taking money out of the reserves to make sure that we do n't have to put back twenty two pounds on the council tax .
309976:46	Erm , to comparison with Peterborough 's particularly useful but it might be , must be said that Peterborough do have problems with at least three or four of the their community centres all the time , in fact have quite a substantial budget on er staff involved in sorting out problems with voluntary managed community centres .
309985:158	I think it 's fair to say that it 's not quite as simple as just deleting that item out of the budget , there are in fact I think five or six people working for community arts and in the events of that item being deleted we would presumably have to add on the costs of making them redundant erm an an an and dis erm the community arts scheme I think represents , it 's true to say , a range of expertise .
310059:24	So it 's not necessarily that one has to be too critical of all the individual items in the way that some people have .
310077:50	This is something which the government has learned how to do , so I must think that this is highly motivated politically on their part , given the way in which the difference between public information and conservative party political propaganda is becoming a blur to .
310108:15	Councillor I I had to admit that I 'm slightly lost in that one A now ends as I understand it with the roman numeral three that was proposed in the labour amendment .
310131:30	Right , agree with what councillor and councillor have had to say about the first part of this .
310141:15	I feel I must if anyone in my in my ward there are two rounds .
310146:90	Now one of the things that we have in this city that I do n't think they have as many in Ipswich are students and that must be one of the biggest , they are they party revellers of the century , they have parties all the time .
310163:55	If you 're going to , if you 're going to provide the service you have to be careful that it , it is being effective , as effective as it can be , does it need to be more effective and should it be operating all week .
310167:44	Mr Mayor , I do feel after councillor er er er speech I just have to make a little comment erm people in my ward .
310168:55	But having I could just tell councillor that the main problems which he felt he had to bring into this debate , the main problem is parking across the driveways in Harvey Goodwin Avenue , both the residents get very fed up because the parking .
310172:66	There is a lot left to do so can we please er try and stick to the point I have to chair right to respond should he so chose , but not about the cars in Stretton Avenue .
310173:51	I mean I I take this more more seriously my on Wednesdays and Thursdays have to be cancelled now because they will be .
310182:9	Do I have to call the abstentions ?
310202:190	Now that will need to be assessed by the council as a whole against it 's priorities with regard to the balancing of the use of capital against capital to prop up the revenue er expenditure of the council and conceivably er to deal with the problems arising er out of government er legislation and clearly we are going to have to make some decisions decisions about this .
310203:64	But there is undoubtedly a need for council expenditure in this city and elsewhere in this particularly recommendation we clearly have to realise more capital whether from the judiciousness of our asset or of course by .
310250:103	With regard to the now unimportant four percent increase which then if you may made I 'm sure councillors deny it and if we are to believe the reason that we have to bring our rents to this level is because government policy so dictates that we shall do .
310254:32	Er of tory council and policy perhaps we would not have to be saying to our tenants that we must raise you rents by nine point four percent this year and let 's not forget seventeen nine , I think seventeen point six percent last year that were government guidelines .
310254:60	Er of tory council and policy perhaps we would not have to be saying to our tenants that we must raise you rents by nine point four percent this year and let 's not forget seventeen nine , I think seventeen point six percent last year that were government guidelines .
310277:180	The , another point is that that having raised the hopes of the housing associations the council is now actually trying to close a door that that we ourselves opened and this is tantamount to paying lip service to the health and the housing associations , yes , we 'll support you but not if it means that we have to sell you our houses .
310336:46	The question a to ask a supplementary question referring to the previous answer and that chair must have two minutes to reply to that .
310355:7	I must prepare to say at this point that I have a special report on the Colville Road area to er er committee , not just on the now but I think we probably need to have further consultation with regard to the needs in that area .
310363:83	Now , one member of the joint traffic management sub-committee who has been closely associated with all of these three issues is county councillor Tony and I must say , Mr Mayor that I am surprised to say the least by the way in which councillor appears appears to have been treated by some members of the labour party in this city .
310372:36	To collect the takings , er from the vending machine you have to go through the adjacent community room into a small box room at the far end .
310406:44	but I said to Don , Well I would have thought they have had to have been displayed er to support the fact that they do have incident s you know trained incident stewards on site .
310474:31	So it 's it 's all in all must be done by staff .
310476:7	It must be .
310478:12	Er what we have got to do you see a as I have said we really got to designate a duty to a position
310482:42	the they day staff , so consequently whoever 's in a =pec specific position has got to have the responsibilities that go with that position .
310558:40	the fact that the offices are no longer there but somebody 's gonna have to make sure that all that block is cleared and the only person permanent fixture is clerk of the scales as you quite rightly said .
310784:31	Er in so much as I mean I must admit with these increases , I appreciate your need to get the extra profits and I 'm looking at the ones where I think we can push them to get a bit more .
310805:30	Er the group will buy European rubbish if they have to .
310823:20	You see but I 've had to have this run
310830:12	So I 've had to have this print run of detailed customer parts by quantity for ninety three .
310888:19	Now erm we will have to look at the situation with regard to the er all the other ones and we 'll do an analysis , what are the volumes and so on and what other what other popular metric bearings
310904:75	Of course you w of course you would Of course you would and it may be that what you will have to say is , Well look , erm I gave you the four per cent on the on the precision types and that that really has to stay , but by the time we by the time we 've done all the analysis on the er on the popular metrics , it will work out that it is is is only two per cent .
310904:156	Of course you w of course you would Of course you would and it may be that what you will have to say is , Well look , erm I gave you the four per cent on the on the precision types and that that really has to stay , but by the time we by the time we 've done all the analysis on the er on the popular metrics , it will work out that it is is is only two per cent .
310982:7	I must admit I 'm in that
311036:12	Yeah and I have to walk away from the others .
311272:9	And I must admit with Ken , Ken is is least to blame because he just puts the orders on , Pauline is the one who schedules it , but the scheduling is just the swannee .
311376:15	You know you have to draw the line at how far you can go but I 'm f I 'm worried about this account definitely .
311398:26	that is a danger , what we have to try and remember although it 's no great comfort to you , is that overall , the prize is tremendous
311652:37	This is clearly er erm a situation where erm we must not knowingly take business which we have not enjoyed before at a price below
311784:14	In fact I must admit , I hinted to Dave if if linear will do consignment stock for , why should n't we if we 're only forty minutes away .
311847:41	There 's another few weeks have drifted and sooner or later we 'll have to start making .
311863:15	No because all we have to do is switch it on switch it off like that .
311962:9	And they had to send one wagon , because they could n't load it , over to to pick up some more
312073:9	Do we have to make a decision .
312119:65	I still want to get it going but I do n't want to put a double shift onto unless I have to .
312199:48	It 's not a matter of they 're not reconcilable , I think there has to be a strong point that 's made .
312324:65	So they 've been used to their own rate and I said each time , if you 're gonna get you must tell them it 's the cleanup rate .
312375:29	I mean I could understand when we had to climb up the belt which was damn dangerous , but now we 've altered all that .
312413:71	Er we 're limited with people and while Brian was in the verge of moving it which the electrics all had to be took out and rerun , he got called away , down to the pre-packs to a breakdown so obviously it did n't get done , the job stopped cos there 's nobody else .
312465:5	had to go to a breakdown , the poor bloke did n't know whether he was coming or going so one of these situations that stress stress arrives .
312512:66	If it dries up for three or four days it 's st dries up for three or four days and Dennis has to stop the minute he picks it up it 's just blown away .
312629:12	then you probably have to take it from that and I think you 'll find there 's a weeks work on there .
312683:25	And he would you would really only have to verify because at the end of the day what you said about You you mentioned somewhere along there Ray about given the fact that they were inexperienced .
312692:49	The most people that we could get together in a weeks notice , we have to put the actual amalgamation of the team
312716:7	we had to split it into two .
312735:10	I honestly had to bully Eric to get a list .
312900:46	Yeah well it probably will be cos but it I mean they 've never had to go to that extension have they ?
313044:72	But the other one of the is a nine o' clock delivery in the morning you see so the rest of the load must be there you see .
313093:9	Then we had to rearrange it .
313099:29	still got Bill as previously arranged but we had to find somebody else for Jack .
313108:26	This is the first time we 've had to do this interceptor cos I did n't even know it was in and I do n't think Dick did .
313299:76	Well I mean it 's going to sort of s start shooting up to round about a thousand pound then you 'll have to have a word with Tom .
313323:13	Of everything they had to check .
313445:12	Well I I have to pose the question then do we want the
313470:10	You 'll have to shrink wrap it wo n't you .
313575:55	I mean I do n't want to enhance the cost of that any more than I have to .
313602:10	you 'll have to talk to Stuart because you 've got the hire on a week by week basis .
313694:65	Er well if it 's if it 's possible yeah , but if if it 's on your you 'll have to disconnect your battery .
313779:12	The beam 'll have to come out .
313780:12	The beam 'll have to be changed without a doubt .
313783:7	He must 've whacked it fairly hard to caused that sort of damage .
313808:61	So I rang Paul and er he 's coming up tomorrow , he would have come in today had to go to but he 's coming in the morning to look at it .
313831:24	Yeah , that was all I had to report thank you .
313853:9	But we had to do something .
313869:77	Yes yes of co of course I was , but i could n't get hold of Dr and I thought well we 're gonna have to try it this way anyway at some stage .
313946:27	But there are occasions when we 've had to rip and tip but it 's causing a problem
313948:43	cos we 've got thirty five pallets down at street which then has to be
313949:14	re-stacked and it has to be rewrapped and
314025:7	they must be uniform .
314026:7	They must n't be out of the perimeters of the pallet .
314029:27	And it 's all all the loads have to be signed by Chand and or to say
314056:66	I 'd rather spend money doing that before they go out than send them out and the bloody things to have to come back again .
314069:18	I 'm saying we have to be self critical
314075:7	I had to come back to a degree agreeing with them .
314097:7	we have to do that as well .
314450:18	Yes , and er you have to hurry to see plot two because if people move in late on Tuesday , but erm we can see that monitor development , it er we are we are a quality builder , we 're not a clown .
314460:86	The only benefits that seem to have been suggested is that their proposals are better than what 's there at the moment , er Grant Developments must be aware that there is a , an approval , a current planning approval for the development of that site , which is a development to retain the existing bungalow and develop the existing bungalow , and to build a house in the rear .
314782:10	You 'll have to uproot the lot , surely ?
314835:15	And then we would have to have another think
314856:81	Because er there 's too much , because they did n't like the way things were run , something like that and on occasions we have had to say to people , we 're sorry , we just do n't think you 're the right kind of person for us .
314858:19	And the first thing I have to say a about the way the the place runs , is that it does n't run like an ordinary museum , nor does it run like and ordinary house .
314883:87	And er it took us a long time to get the special material because as you will gather , we tend to do everything properly , so we had to have the a cloth specially woven er handwoven of course and especially dyed and for once we had it especially fooled in other words the nap was raised .
314926:49	Those of you who know York will perhaps remember that you used to have to duck if you were any height at all to get underneath there , well you do n't now .
315066:12	You do n't have to .
315111:81	Erm and in fact more that and all our more valuable pieces are marked because they are so close to the original that er you have to mark them
315117:11	Since we had to renew so much of the timber , we thought we would turn that to good account , rather than trying to We do n't want it to look as if it 's five hundred years old .
315118:41	So one of the things that suppliers are told is they must on no account stress or age or mess about with any furnishings .
315191:27	But we ca n't do that because we have to make our tiles in the way that 's most .
315193:9	But they have to be dried in sunlight before they can be fired .
315292:249	Tiles were the ro making the tiles was a major operation because erm when they first tried to make the tiles they tried they dug a hole big hole at Rawcliffe and they they tried to make forty thousand tiles , line them all up in the pit and they brought something like forty tonnes of dry wood chippings from the erm saw mills in er forest but they could n't quite get it hot enough so the whole lot had to be thrown away do again .
315316:140	They 're dyed also naturally in the medieval way with red for the madder and then welled to give the yellow as the basis of digris and then a woad an indigo from woad erm slightly cheating there because we could n't have enough woad , we have to use import the actual substance .
315318:97	We are planting four acres of woad in order to have a blue bed for next year cos there is n't enough woad is is is in rather short supply so we have to grow our own .
315338:44	So we have a if we ever want any ironwork we just have to go and say , oh well we 'll have one of those please .
315348:84	We 're fortunate in having an excellent blacksmith called John who 's also the Minster 's blacksmith , who manages all our ironwork very cheaply we have to d he 's so busy we have to just get it when we can .
315348:111	We 're fortunate in having an excellent blacksmith called John who 's also the Minster 's blacksmith , who manages all our ironwork very cheaply we have to d he 's so busy we have to just get it when we can .
315354:57	The side walls were bricked in in a brick skin , they could n't breathe and we 've had to replace as you saw outside , virtually all the timber .
315381:63	Including these tremendously long towels which are er one and a half times the length of the table because they have to go over everybody 's lap as a napkin kind of communal napkin .
315383:39	So people would be sitting round four corners of this , they had to have a napkin over all their laps which they did .
315389:9	But I must n't go into that now .
315410:23	Right , the arch braces of course had to be put in because they were if you look at it you 'll see that they were actually sawn off .
315435:36	So what we 've done we thought we 're gonna have to replicate that hearth .
315450:25	I I 'm I say you must excuse me going on at such a pace but I 've got A I 've got another meeting quite shortly and B you 've got some little mo I think M Michael 's looking to take over .
315536:127	And this is the great chamber , and this is where their tour ends I think if we just go back if we go straight back into the place we started , and so just finish it off , then I must I must finish off as well .
315536:134	And this is the great chamber , and this is where their tour ends I think if we just go back if we go straight back into the place we started , and so just finish it off , then I must I must finish off as well .
315543:25	it 's something we 've just had to leave cos it 's .
315558:62	Some people I mean , Elsie loves cleaning things so she 's spends all her time waxing things cos has to be cleaned very carefully .
315559:8	You must n't use modern things on them or it 'll really wrock them irreparably and you 've done four thousand pounds worth of damage before you know it .
315564:39	. do n't this is one of those places where you have to
315631:15	And we may well have to do it again .
315654:177	But erm we ca n't spend money we have n't go , we ca n't spend money and erm I mean er if we spent if we went on spending money , then what would happen is that the Trust would simply well it would go it would n't exactly go broke but jobs would have to be cut and that sort of thing , people would be very badly affected by it so you just have to wait .
315654:242	But erm we ca n't spend money we have n't go , we ca n't spend money and erm I mean er if we spent if we went on spending money , then what would happen is that the Trust would simply well it would go it would n't exactly go broke but jobs would have to be cut and that sort of thing , people would be very badly affected by it so you just have to wait .
315697:28	It should be quite fun cos they have to carve by messes got these knives .
315715:7	We have to have an approved caterer which and what 's gonna happen is that those two room that the room where the weld and the wool were , we 're gonna virtually be sealed off
315720:10	But we have to do it , they 'd be absolutely down on us like a ton of bricks if we did n't .
315739:10	you 'll have to excuse me now , erm I must go and you you 'll take over .
315739:38	you 'll have to excuse me now , erm I must go and you you 'll take over .
315834:49	A dinner was organized for the Euro campaign , we sold about ten tickets , we had to cancel .
315843:7	We must now look to the future .
315904:28	And it says The Tory government which must which must take responsibility for setting up a rapacious duopoly of generating companies .
315904:33	And it says The Tory government which must which must take responsibility for setting up a rapacious duopoly of generating companies .
315984:155	So I mean it it was it was represented to me er and I felt that there was some logic in it that that this company would not be discussing this deal unless it felt it could make money out of it and that money in the end would have to come out of the local people here .
316077:14	You do n't have to do it , just tell me and I 'll I 'll tell them .
316092:183	Er had they got their way every time we put a cheque in or took one out or moved money from one account to another it would have cost us eighty pence , which meant that had anybody paid their their fees to the er and made the cheque payable to us directly , we would have had to bank that cheque and then reissue another cheque er to the appropriate department and that would have cost us one pound sixty , for which we 'd have got nothing .
316095:78	Erm we have we had in in this particular set of accounts thirty five pounds on two occasions for rooms er which we had to let go and computer data er which is still being processed I understand at a cost of forty pounds .
316115:16	So we we may have to pursue that further but there has been some progress after all this time and expenditure of money and and time .
316120:87	Well the reason why we were attracted to it was of course the very point that that they would translate the disks for nothing , we would n't have to type out the register , and they would also add the telephone numbers without us having to look them all up so that we could do telephone canvassing .
316156:12	You do n't have to write very much .
316165:44	We used to get exactly the same rebate , the only thing is we have to wait three months for it .
316321:115	And as for all special schools there is an obligation to provide a scheme for local management of special schools with effect from April this year er we consulted there was a little bit of chasing which had to take place in which you can see in section four of the report but following that chasing , we now ascertain meeting schools on favourable proposals for or against and once a week that , a view of and also undertaking as you know .
316365:8	I have to say these , these are documents in terms of the addition .
316401:10	We do have to look at all our pre-school children as a group who have similar means as they grow and they learn and they develop and I hope that we can continue to push for a co-ordinated approach to the whole range of services that we are o offering to that group of children and to their families .
316414:77	The need to prepare schools and help to help schools prepare themselves for the erm review of the national curriculum the changes that they will have to deal with and in particular I think , erm to help secondary schools to come to terms with changes in key stage four and the likely erm opportunities there will be for a more diverse curriculum including eventually er the opportunities for more vocational programmes in schools and to assist schools
316507:38	Now we could n't do it anyway next year , we 'll have to do it the following year as we 've heard earlier .
316513:41	It could n't happen anyway , in the next financial year , it 'd have to be the following financial year .
316567:18	Er I think we must remind ourselves that er this year 's as I say is by no means er generous and for that reason we 're not aiming higher , not because we would n't like to , but because we recognize the , the restrictions placed from elsewhere .
316570:22	Er but of course I I must say something about section eleven funding , this whole section under funding , er is er featured in , in , in this section and er , er I 'm not too sure what the Tories are playing at er , unlike Bob I am not going to condemn them out of hand now , being a Democrat I want you to hear what they have to say and then we 'll roast them this afternoon
316570:222	Er but of course I I must say something about section eleven funding , this whole section under funding , er is er featured in , in , in this section and er , er I 'm not too sure what the Tories are playing at er , unlike Bob I am not going to condemn them out of hand now , being a Democrat I want you to hear what they have to say and then we 'll roast them this afternoon
316573:24	in recent years but among the worst must be the reduction by the Home Office of taxable funding
316576:42	They say they ca n't afford it , we say that we must afford it .
316583:130	Er Mr Major pretends it 's his but Mr Patten , if I understand Mr Patten rightly , says the country ca n't afford it , so here again if they ca n't afford it , I certainly ca n't county , county must afford er at least the six hundred and thirty five thousand which is in our proposals er that will be nine , sixty five in a full year , to find nine hundred and twenty extra places .
316592:140	erm the rest of arbitrary proposals maybe considered small comparison in , in financial terms at least but er differ a little if any in , in educational value , that 's two hundred thousand to boost the fourteen and nineteen strategy , er I think there must in the present climate in which we have to regard the vocational content of education as well as the academic .
316592:166	erm the rest of arbitrary proposals maybe considered small comparison in , in financial terms at least but er differ a little if any in , in educational value , that 's two hundred thousand to boost the fourteen and nineteen strategy , er I think there must in the present climate in which we have to regard the vocational content of education as well as the academic .
316593:12	Erm we must recognize
316594:53	that the , to cope with the expression on that there , that erm we , we must fund , fund this referral unit , erm coming last to capital , erm many of school buildings are in an abysmal and dilapidated position through neglect over many , many years before er , we 've given perhaps , erm , but our meagre a hundred and ninety thousand er I 've , I admit wo n't go very far .
316596:93	Erm I do n't think I need to say any more , but I promise to come back later when I 've heard what other have , have to say .
316615:59	The Chief Education Officer sorry Director also contain these warnings in her introduction , she reminded us that we would have to discharge our responsibilities in the years to come , she reminded us that decisions are never easy and she reminded us that we need to show that we are capable of firm managerial action .
316643:17	I believe that we must look very closely into the alternative meal .
316645:70	I spoke not to an individual child but to the head of school in Hatfield where the scheme was piloted and I have to say he was , he neither rhapsodised nor condemned .
316705:87	It 's hardly worth drawing the cheques in certain cases and the capital programme , could n't see it actually when I looked for it first time , had to go back to the pink sheet and found the noughts , now we 're not as generous as we 'd like to be , but at least we try .
316745:7	you must , however ,
316748:7	we must take heed though Chairman of the warning in the report and that was mentioned by Mrs Hilary , that it 's the responsibility of this Council to plan the future needs on the basis of the estimated shortfall in resources that have been forecast .
316753:12	But obviously it must be necessary to waive the statutory sectors , versus the non statutory , so it is n't er possible this year , perhaps to put in as we might do if were to be as imprudent as the opposition parties .
316761:57	Undoubtedly therefore much of the growth that they 've put in is this year 's budget , will have to result in schools ' budgets being cut in the future .
316781:53	Er the problem with the job is it 's very tight inside there so we 've had to use cranes and basically poured concrete er ours is being done by a separate sub-contractor .
316782:79	Er few problems with the job before we started or during the job er , come back to us for a six so far so we have to What we will do is drop them down and Er another problem with the job is we 're about three week 's behind er arranged for them to come in on Monday .
316783:7	we had to pull forward it 's not due so we 've got er so we 've given them three days to You see when we worked out the numbers for the we were given all the , the allowances , the rates et cetera , et cetera , we worked the forecast through and seen huge amounts of time given for which the assumption is that it 's all done by hand , the job these cranes so the resources how much money had been spent .
316797:10	Yes we had to get them all into the tanks otherwise
316809:57	We 're going to talk to you about er Farm project and its basic problems which we had to put a programme together and er make the job
316811:31	our construction but the only to get there we had to squeeze through a gap this way and come round
316814:59	Twelve weeks over the time that is allotted in the programme and to do that we 're gonna have to produce the twice the rate that we 're doing now .
316819:31	We decided one of our first things we had to do was decide on a sequence of construction for these tanks .
317015:64	Er , quite often on real projects people produce these plans and they get out and work to that and never had to pause to think , this is a good one , this is a bad one .
317031:9	So we have to assess the current state and if we did n't know then in our particular example , cos if we had n't made the room numbers had been done .
317035:31	So in , in both projects I think we had to do that first step .
317036:12	Er , we had to get the number of resources .
317038:12	Now , everybody had to do that .
317039:95	Er , there you said I 'd got three formwork gangs or four formwork gangs six a gang er and here you said I 'd got so many so we had to do that .
317040:57	They were n't any good by themselves er , these things because I the other thing which you had to get from somewhere was output rates .
317045:57	In , in this one it might 've been slightly easier because everything was spelled out you had to do you had to do carpenting , you had to do electrical .
317045:70	In , in this one it might 've been slightly easier because everything was spelled out you had to do you had to do carpenting , you had to do electrical .
317045:88	In , in this one it might 've been slightly easier because everything was spelled out you had to do you had to do carpenting , you had to do electrical .
317048:33	In this one we had n't told you that you had to strip formwork , that you had to er , make the formwork , that you had to fix the steel , you had to know this from your own knowledge .
317048:55	In this one we had n't told you that you had to strip formwork , that you had to er , make the formwork , that you had to fix the steel , you had to know this from your own knowledge .
317048:86	In this one we had n't told you that you had to strip formwork , that you had to er , make the formwork , that you had to fix the steel , you had to know this from your own knowledge .
317048:108	In this one we had n't told you that you had to strip formwork , that you had to er , make the formwork , that you had to fix the steel , you had to know this from your own knowledge .
317050:9	So you had to know that in order to , to pour concrete you had to have something to pour it into and you had to put the erm you had to have er reinforcements as well .
317050:49	So you had to know that in order to , to pour concrete you had to have something to pour it into and you had to put the erm you had to have er reinforcements as well .
317050:84	So you had to know that in order to , to pour concrete you had to have something to pour it into and you had to put the erm you had to have er reinforcements as well .
317050:105	So you had to know that in order to , to pour concrete you had to have something to pour it into and you had to put the erm you had to have er reinforcements as well .
317051:28	Bu but basically the output rates were , you had to do .
317052:7	You had to think of a method and the method was particularly difficult , I think , on the tank farm one where this is the sort of method that I am thinking here of how , how on earth am I going to build it on , on the hotel ?
317062:9	So you had to choose that er , you have to do that and the fifth thing that I wrote down here which I had to do , a sequence er , of work .
317062:32	So you had to choose that er , you have to do that and the fifth thing that I wrote down here which I had to do , a sequence er , of work .
317062:79	So you had to choose that er , you have to do that and the fifth thing that I wrote down here which I had to do , a sequence er , of work .
317064:7	You have to do the detail sequence er so for the tank farm this is , here I 've got to do the formwork before the reinforcement before the concrete or the other way round , I 've got to the reinforcement before the formwork before the concrete .
317090:14	Because you 've had to make different assumptions and you 've er decided different ways are different .
317092:46	Now when you 're out on site some of these things you have to do each week .
317093:23	Some of them you do n't have to do each week because they 're there from previous work on , on the site .
317095:34	Somebody might not have collected them , so you might have to And as work changes it would er , then the method .
317109:23	Whereas in reality I think people have got to take responsibility and say , this is a reasonable time for you to do it in and we will control that reasonable time .
317209:51	Because there are , I do n't know how many sites Tarmac run , but there must be at least the number of sites that they 've ever run divided by two standard ways of planning , Tarmac .
317223:10	We 'll have to look in John 's thing , yeah ?
317324:55	But I actually think that you 've got access problems in both of them and they have to be considered because the do really affect severely or they could severely affect er the success or failure of the programme , and it 's these list of things which you think , now I 've thought about that or I have n't thought about that .
317509:27	If I ca n't , then I will have to make up my own in order to control the , the programme to work .
317646:27	I , I , I believe that this has got to be reported .
317783:31	Erm you actually you know you do n't have to say I 'm .
317800:31	Alison I understand you 're the person who has to drive information on .
317801:27	So you 're the one who really has to do er if the if the system does n't suit you or if the system 's hard work if you have problems .
317953:49	But they reckon when they did obviously it 's a set that probably someone had to say the same thing doing or the same person went through so many functions and it was worked using different ways of saying .
317961:24	It would be normal well it must be what I 've said .
318052:14	No you do n't have to .
318069:11	Because you have to be cutting with the verbal .
318107:10	They actually have to come and meet the person fact to face .
318110:9	A you have to actually you know make arrangements .
318123:7	We have to act more
318173:10	Well I have to do
318215:10	And I have to talk to him on the phone and I 'm saying speak to him very well .
318273:13	On Wednesday I have to visit the dentist .
318276:13	On Wednesday I have to visit the dentist .

318386:23	The box is empty we will have to get some more .
318388:23	The box is empty we will have to get some more .
318408:25	The box is empty and we will have to get some more .
318410:23	The box is empty I will have to get some more .
318413:23	The box is empty we will have to get some more .
318414:23	The box is empty we will have to get some more .
318588:60	He walked quickly down the road and then it was something about him not being late cos he had to a contract .
318688:40	What d' ya you were saying Karen how d' ya have to how did you manage to do it ?
318731:9	And you have to try and think it differently .
318792:16	Or even if you have to clarify the title by saying who is responsible for making sure that materials that you use arrive at the place that they 're supposed to arrive at the time .
318794:10	You might have to be more clear about what you 're specifically asking for rather than use handles titles .
318796:10	You may have to talk out functions of the job .
318809:77	Is there anything else that you learned thinking of the exercise now listening when you put the shoe on the other foot and you have to stick to .
318811:53	There 's an obvious thing really that erm if someone dictates something to you and you have to repeat that word for word what would you normally do by
318818:24	Or I ca n't do it I have to scribble .
318819:7	I have to scribble .
318878:12	You know have to remember the person .
319033:72	You 're you 're actually saying what would would I be right in saying that there would n't er they 'd have to without you if you were ill .
319084:172	you know it 's almost as if it 's like er you know a sort of negative thing to , to , to find out about somebody erm so erm yeah I mean I think I , so I think you 'll , I think you 'll , you 'll of necessity have to try and do something which captures this , this sort of informal talk because as soon as people commit themselves to writing they 're gonna be erm they 're gonna be
319090:88	Yes it 's very situational , erm I think , as I think human beings are so erm so , so I think you , you 're gonna have to
319120:137	So I mean maybe , maybe there 's context , maybe there 's the sort of situation oh this , this is an area where , you know , kind of this is an area that 's full of poofs so he must be erm
319161:13	I 'll just have to omit there .
319322:68	I know when , when invented scales back in the early thirties er typically they were declarative statements which people had to agree or disagree with erm but er I think perhaps more recently people have gone more for things that are a bit like how would you feel , what do you think type statements erm so er
319525:10	er you have to use other books
319541:38	and I , they do a bit and then another one , you have to go into another textbook
319558:7	You have to go to like ten different
319598:45	in psychology and chucked in electrical engineering and started a psychology course and he had to work at the same time as he studied for some of that time
319622:12	I 'm gonna have to do some work on this and then erm
319756:12	Phew , just had to burst into somebody else 's class and get my er thing back .
319812:10	You only have to do eight out of ten .
319944:34	about analysis or me giving them the dream and I have to sort of like get out for myself what
320144:36	things to like , like a colour green you 'd have to
320426:10	Anyway I must get on .
320447:53	Yes erm let 's just er find it again , no that 's not it , I must have it here somewhere .
320532:15	I think you have to use S P S S cos I did n't
320976:37	Dialogues are carried on to tell the reader something he must know , or to infuse into him some explanations of a writer .
321033:9	and you must accept the fact that she 's an animal knowing that
321105:25	I mean , everybody a o clearly had to jump to his tune !
321371:40	But she made up her mind , did n't she , that she had to publish this book under a man 's name ?
321373:9	So she must have been really , had really deep feelings about what was going on in society and why she should do that .
321487:25	choose to give it up , as must the man , in
321548:16	We are , and must be , one and all , burdened with faults in this world .
321607:12	Which she has to learn to do in
321610:7	She has to learn to
321680:19	To do so , you must have a coadjutor , not a brother , that is a loose tie , but a husband .
321685:41	And then a few pages on when she says , erm we must abandon the scheme of marriage .
321712:7	She has to learn to distinguish betwe sh to , to recognize the falseness of that statement .
321724:81	oh , I mean er , I know we can have different opinions on why we think St John is so adamant that she must be his wife I do think it 's a power struggle .
321918:12	They , they must have existed these characters
321920:24	that , you know , clergy must n't
322257:7	They must , er , especially if it was up
322261:19	sticks , erm , there must have been quite a few schools for girls
322265:7	They must have been pious .
322274:23	the , the idea of educating girls must have been allowed .
322275:7	You had to be able to pay .
322277:7	You had to be able pay .
322370:12	Erm , I must ask a question
322430:26	Do you think that the er it must be the war , the first world war , if you 've been watching Testament of Youth , Fear and Britain 's Testament of Youth , which I read years ago
323019:22	it all settles again and you have to accept it .
323202:9	But there must have been cases were n't there ?
323394:29	erm er portraits of , er men you have to take i it that erm we could argue Charlotte Bronte was very critical of the men she knew and , the men she thought she might know , and did n't erm , you have to look at the women who feed into the making of them
323394:141	erm er portraits of , er men you have to take i it that erm we could argue Charlotte Bronte was very critical of the men she knew and , the men she thought she might know , and did n't erm , you have to look at the women who feed into the making of them
323397:19	As you say , you have to look at Mrs Reed
323587:21	it up , you do n't have to
323747:130	One afternoon a flying fortress which had come off worse on the mission over Germany tried to land at Walsall , which was much too small to take an aircraft of this size , and the girl in the control box had to find , fire a warning vary light and radio to send him off to Castle Bromwich which was much bigger in those days er it was an airport to take an aircraft the size of the Flying Fortress that 's about it up until here I 've written
323751:62	I was only a lad , I was er a messenger boy on the loading deck and I used to have to go down to at Beskett and fetch parts for the planes and er plates , aluminium plates , to be normalized which was a treatment when they put them into the vats and I had to fetch the films as well , from the house that used to be a warehouse for films over in er in by the beacon , great bar !
323751:172	I was only a lad , I was er a messenger boy on the loading deck and I used to have to go down to at Beskett and fetch parts for the planes and er plates , aluminium plates , to be normalized which was a treatment when they put them into the vats and I had to fetch the films as well , from the house that used to be a warehouse for films over in er in by the beacon , great bar !
323771:21	Erm they er as airfields had to be protected they build some pillboxes , country pillboxes for the Home Guard at strategic points
323775:45	Oh no no , it was really a happy-go-lucky time you , you had to be alive in those days to appreciate it , it , people sort of got together and it , it 's a different attitude to life today er much more friendly people there and they , we all worked together we all pulled together to defeat Hitler this , this was the thing in those days .
323783:140	There were engine fitters , electricians , riggers and er course there were sheet metal workers as well working in aluminium and pop rivets er there was er also a government inspection department and a works inspection department and er things and da the Air Ministry had to be very up to scratch you know erm
323787:81	Well after the , the aircraft had actually er left the airport to go , be handed back to the RAF they said sometimes had to be serviced or final adjustments made and that 's what they used to go out there for but erm Helliwells was ver it was still , all through the war it was Helliwells aircraft they used to have their own lorries and everything and they used to erm , be under the auspices of the Air Ministry but it was very much a private company .
323798:24	You mentioned that you used to have to go to Helliwells down at Beskett
323822:20	Well as I understand they must have had pumps down there or something to or something to keep them dry because er
323837:215	I remember going down to the bridge in Walsall and a sailor climbed the old clock and tied his collar around it and a soldier got up and put his hat on and an airman got up and put his tie with a red , white and blue rosette on it , around the arms of the old clock and people were loving and kissing everywhere , and oh it was really you had to be alive to appreciate it .
323846:7	It must have been quite exciting to hear them .
323878:200	Ca n't tell you how long a journey it was back in the fog from Liverpool that day , and then when we were relegated back again to the third division it was on the last match of the season against Charlton , and the heavens opened and a big thunder storm and it just flooded the pitch and the referee just called the match off and they had to play it again the following Friday and Charlton ran out two-one winners and Walsall finished with nine fit men and still that 's the football I suppose .
323883:206	The erm , yes these and it started to be like warfare more than a game you know at that stage but hopefully now we 're getting back to some sort of sanity with the membership cards you know , because we , the crowd is segregated from the away supporters now and that 's cos if Walsall go into the second division again they 'll have to spend so much I believe on the ground to cage the away supporters in which they do n't have to do in the third division .
323883:268	The erm , yes these and it started to be like warfare more than a game you know at that stage but hopefully now we 're getting back to some sort of sanity with the membership cards you know , because we , the crowd is segregated from the away supporters now and that 's cos if Walsall go into the second division again they 'll have to spend so much I believe on the ground to cage the away supporters in which they do n't have to do in the third division .
323904:53	That , that 's open to the general public but where I stand you have to have a membership card to go in there now , and er you pay two pound before the season started and er local traders give you a discount and things erm it 's just one way of er segregating the supporters if you like , but there does n't seem to be so much trouble since they 've done this , but at the same time there does n't seem to be as much atmosphere
323961:16	Well they , they had to do the , it had n't used to have very good drainage and far more of a slope , it , it 's far more level today than it used to be , it used to have a great slope towards the long end which was considered an advantage to Walsall and the water used to gather , but I believe the improved the drainage and had pipes put under which it , it does n't seem to gather water so much now down at the railway end .
324050:64	And erm we used to work from seven o' clock in the morning until seven at night , we had to walk from New Invention to Hall because there were n't any buses and erm there were some girls , some girls worked at Legs have you heard of
324057:198	Yeah oh yeah I did n't work anywhere else in Willenhall at all , and erm but we 'd got to be in for seven o' clock and if erm you were n't in for seven o' clock and sometimes I used to hear the bell began ringing when I got to go around the corner and get into the , but you had to wait a quarter of an hour before they would let you in and that was stopped off your money and my wage was eight and fourpence a week .
324059:235	Oh I had about a shilling pocket money I think , although they used , they 'd fine you , they 'd stop money off you if you were late if you were a quarter of an hour late you could n't go in and erm until , and then you 'd got to explain to your mums , well that you were some money short you see , why is this , and we had to say well we were a bit late getting in when you started out soon enough you see .
324071:77	Oh no , oh no you could n't heat anything up no , no but erm oh we well there was n't anything else you have to accept things do n't you , there was n't anything else to do .
324075:91	I do n't remember there having a break , we had the break at er midday but I do n't remember , if we , if we did we had to work you know what I mean , we just have I forget , that is a bit I 've forgotten
324082:28	We perhaps had a works ' er we had to have a works ' holiday yeah .
324166:9	Did you have to work Saturdays as well ?
324297:146	Yeah , and one got stuck in the , there was an entry between my father-in-law 's shop and the next one and one of these cattle ran down the entry and got stuck in the entry , you know it was only narrow and the they had to shoot it , but er oh yes it was a , that was a thing you never hear of today and you never hear of people putting tannin down when people are ill do you ?
324399:9	So they had to wait to be dug out did they ?
324420:9	Did you have to go to college or ?
324461:7	It must 've taken quite a bit of courage for the girls to have kept their babies .
324469:17	And I used to have to sing hymns for them on the wards , they used to love that
324638:29	Yes and then being with government people , they had to go on trek
324650:9	and Mr had to see the different people being , acting like a magistrate while he was there as he was district commissioner .
324685:26	and er so Mrs said oh we must , we must try and get out of Khartoum cos it was so hot and we 'd booked to go to k er for a week
324685:35	and er so Mrs said oh we must , we must try and get out of Khartoum cos it was so hot and we 'd booked to go to k er for a week
324689:20	and she said you 'll have to take the children to in the morning , cos it 's all arranged .
324705:58	And er one day I was bathing Judy in the hut and the bell went and I just had to wrap a towel round her , you know , and run down to the sandy wadders And things got so bad , we went back to Khartoum
324710:54	Some got as far as Rhodesia and the high altitude was n't any good so then they had to go on to Cape Town .
324733:74	and erm I used to do erm , keep a check on the flying times of the planes cos every forty hours they had to come in for a different check .
324739:11	that they had to do there .
324837:18	and said you 'd have to get me into hospital , cos I could n't move , you know
324916:14	the nerve impulse , must n't there ?
325116:35	And your sister 's ten years older than you so they must 've been there ten years plus , must n't they ?
325116:56	And your sister 's ten years older than you so they must 've been there ten years plus , must n't they ?
325120:12	you , you must 've been there ten years plus .
325144:124	Yes , yeah , when I used to yeah , when I come home , we was courting then , I used to , old lady Mrs every Saturday when I went down the Fen , I used to have to go into the bakers and get her two ounces of yeast .
325199:35	That did n't matter if that snowed , rained , you had to go .
325207:48	See there were n't no lorries to get them about we used to have to drive .
325353:98	Then er on a Saturdays our slaughterhouse was , our slaughterhouse was still open up the street then and we used to perhaps kill twelve , fourteen pigs for private people , but they had to give their ration up , six months ' or twelve months ' ration up to have these pigs .
325354:10	They perhaps had to give two books up .
325451:47	That sort of thing and the pigs the same , during the war , they all had to go in cen cen centralized slaughterhouses then .
325456:28	and with very little to spare , you had to scheme sometimes , did n't you ?
325459:22	Well you see , you 'll have to switch it off what I
325478:28	Then after I got old enough , well I had to do it as well , yeah .
325479:41	Were n't no good saying you would n't do it , you had to do it and you had to go whether that was raining or not , yeah cos people relied on you taking round little bit of meat for their dinner that day , yeah .
325479:60	Were n't no good saying you would n't do it , you had to do it and you had to go whether that was raining or not , yeah cos people relied on you taking round little bit of meat for their dinner that day , yeah .
325881:31	When you 're going round the Fens , you must 've had a very early start in the morning , did you ?
325889:11	Used to have to feed the ponies early .
325946:7	You must 've found that very tiring , did you ?
325960:14	But erm I had to do that in between if Harry had n't got enough help .
325963:64	But erm if people fell sick , you know , anybody fell sick , well you all , you had to fall in and fill their place .
326001:9	But you must of had the enjoyment of , of the work itself ?
326031:9	Or you have to please everybody
326033:9	and you had to be nice to everybody do n't you ?
326067:18	Does that mean you have to , had to work fairly slowly and carefully ?
326067:27	Does that mean you have to , had to work fairly slowly and carefully ?
326069:16	I er we had to keep busy , you see , cos it was always
326070:7	You had to keep
326180:7	You must 've had to be very careful then when he was slaughtering the animals if he was a haemo
326180:13	You must 've had to be very careful then when he was slaughtering the animals if he was a haemo
326271:30	Prior to getting around to the job I have to do , and that is to honour those men that gave their lives so that we could be free , I 'd like to just share a few things with you as we return to this wonderful country .
326282:26	I hope that future generations will never have to suffer the , and endure the noise that we did for the same purpose .
326370:158	the er sweets and er chocolates etcetera that er we received , erm I think we in fact er , erm yeah well I , we obviously appreciate them very much because er they were something that we a lot of and erm I know that er , that you must know that when you er were out in Ipswich , Framlingham or around about that er you met up a group , there was a group of children and I 'm sure you heard the er familiar up , chum .
326406:109	But this er American pilot , Commanding General , stands before this group with a great sense of humility and a , a sense of great honour , recognizing the only reason I 'm here is because I have to be the Commanding General .
326440:9	Your efforts have to be one of the most remarkable achievements of mankind .
326463:8	We must build armaments , military strength and that is the way to peace .
326630:68	Well it so happened that two of the aircrewmen were burnt enough , not real serious , but burned enough that they had to use the ground spare from another squadron , they could n't go on the mission .
326677:28	Er on appointment , like other recruits , I had to serve the first month on night duty .
326678:58	The night duty was made up of nineteen areas , they made the nineteen beats , and er I had to go with older policemen learning each of the beats .
326679:10	Often I had to learn two beats per night .
326690:7	We had to take our own meals at all times , even when we had cups of tea we had to take to the station our own tea , sugar and milk , but there was always a large kettle during the winter months on a coal fire , and during the summer months on a gas ring .
326690:66	We had to take our own meals at all times , even when we had cups of tea we had to take to the station our own tea , sugar and milk , but there was always a large kettle during the winter months on a coal fire , and during the summer months on a gas ring .
326718:109	Well now in nineteen twenty six we had the general strike , and the conditions in Ipswich were so violent that our Borough Police we could n't cope with them , and our Chief Constable , he had to apply to the Home Office and he got permission to have men from East Suffolk and West Suffolk Police , Cambridge County Police , Huntingdon Police sent some , and they were billeted in hotels in the town centre .
326728:38	We in the borough , we dare not be rough because we had to remain in Ipswich after the strike was over .
326797:70	There was a half of the premises , and the casual wards there they , course I tell you they used to have to bath and then they used to have to do chopping wood and sort of work like , like that .
326797:96	There was a half of the premises , and the casual wards there they , course I tell you they used to have to bath and then they used to have to do chopping wood and sort of work like , like that .
326803:25	Now policemen , we used to have to give these blessed people these tickets , and we used to have a book , and they just merely gave name , age , occupation , which was nearly always labourer , where , and they had to tell us where they came from and where they intended going to , and more often that was from Stowmarket to , or the other way round .
326803:136	Now policemen , we used to have to give these blessed people these tickets , and we used to have a book , and they just merely gave name , age , occupation , which was nearly always labourer , where , and they had to tell us where they came from and where they intended going to , and more often that was from Stowmarket to , or the other way round .
326819:24	You , you were saying you had to visit each of those four lodging houses
326840:7	They must have thought you could do it .
326841:114	I could n't type , we had n't got anybody doing the office work in the detective staff , the Detective Sergeant used to do most of it , if he was not available I used to have to get an older detective to type a report out for me , and because I was a junior , they were not so careful in typing my reports as they were theirs .
326892:7	You had to take them to Norwich .
326902:63	So when Scotland Yard sent us photographs of criminals that we were dealing with , we used to have to take this descriptive form and photograph to Walters the photographers in Plane , and he charged sixpence to copy the photograph .
326917:17	Oh they had I must tell you now that at the time that we had n't got a car at all , on the occasion of a royal visit , or some very important action being taken , my Chief Constable used to hire a chauffeur driven car from Mr of Lane in Ipswich .
326965:11	And , I must get back now to
326970:52	But er we , we had quite a difficulty , very , very difficult , we used to have to walk a long way before we could get to a telephone .
326986:48	And , people from the town centre who were going home to Stoke had to go over the bridge .
327007:7	He must have thought he was Noah .
327034:15	Course I do n't have to tell you any more , she did n't see him no more .
327057:45	Some of it is done by legislation which erm fire officers have to erm put to use er and , and work to erm and then there 's a lot of good will advice and , and help that can be given , er and publicity and training and so on which comes under the big wing of fire prevention .
327078:155	Erm that is an area where , that and road traffic accidents which has grown considerably in , in the time that I 've been in the service in more recent years , which has become more sophisticated , the equipment has become more sophisticated , the techniques have had to be developed to deal with them and firemen are becoming more expert in , in handling these er er situations with , with equipment er which is much more technical , and , and er
327080:127	Well the , the risk has changed for a start I mean with the chemicals there are so many now erm chemicals and so much of it being transported by road , the risk of that and the dangers of accidents must be increased , although legislation has brought in a number of improvements , so firemen have to be very much up to date with that .
327080:175	Well the , the risk has changed for a start I mean with the chemicals there are so many now erm chemicals and so much of it being transported by road , the risk of that and the dangers of accidents must be increased , although legislation has brought in a number of improvements , so firemen have to be very much up to date with that .
327090:80	This is why that the leaning process never ends , it 's , it 's always on , the new developments come in and people have to be taught , and firemen have to keep up to date with that .
327090:100	This is why that the leaning process never ends , it 's , it 's always on , the new developments come in and people have to be taught , and firemen have to keep up to date with that .
327105:78	we 're still involved , and they tell me that life on a fire station is still very pleasant so I 'm sure it must be .
327195:13	What would she have to do ?
327196:17	Er , well you have to carry a twelve stone man over a hundred yards , you see , in a certain time , and that is one of the strength tests , erm er these are these are tests that are drawn up to get people in in the initial stages , and then they go on from there .
327204:34	Er some wo n't wear it at all erm erm have had to leave the Fire Service because of that .
327244:79	I mean I 've known wives er having bicycles ready in the , in the corridors of the house , where all the man had to do was to get his trousers on , if he was asleep in bed , she would come and open the front door , put him on his bike and away he went .
327257:45	Yes , so you have twelve retained firemen , and six , at least , have to go , there are six who go on a tender ?
327281:43	Oh yes oh yes in my thirty odd years erm looking back now it must have been primitive in those days really .
327287:85	The battledress was very good , I mean the army seemed to wore it all that time so er we had it for several years and we had to press that every day , thick material , very heavy .
327289:68	Well , to keep it tidy , you see the , the creases used to come out so quickly , and we had to be , well on parade you were , you were looked at and you had to be very tidy and proper and er if you did n't do it you were told to do it and that was that .
327289:122	Well , to keep it tidy , you see the , the creases used to come out so quickly , and we had to be , well on parade you were , you were looked at and you had to be very tidy and proper and er if you did n't do it you were told to do it and that was that .
327307:82	Though the rumours have told us a great deal , he 's still far from well , he might need a heart bypass , he 's gonna have to retire form politics .
327313:9	But you have to do it g slowly .
327359:22	One of the things they have to do is to get your uric acid I think it 's called erm content correct .
327381:15	I mean I must be honest , I did not feel that frightened erm it was n't an acute pain that that I mean I mean one of the things that one has to realize , you can become a heart attack bore .
327381:107	I mean I must be honest , I did not feel that frightened erm it was n't an acute pain that that I mean I mean one of the things that one has to realize , you can become a heart attack bore .
327495:11	Although I must say I I mean , one of the most fascinating pieces of politics I was ever involved in , was when I had to defend Mrs Thatcher over the Belgrano incident .
327495:82	Although I must say I I mean , one of the most fascinating pieces of politics I was ever involved in , was when I had to defend Mrs Thatcher over the Belgrano incident .
327499:7	I must make that absolutely clear .
327500:9	But I had to get together in one room , the admirals , the intelligence people , the civil servants , all the people who 'd played a critical role in advising her .
327531:21	What about , what she has had to say about John Major ?
327609:54	They 're in deep political trouble because the the electorate is simply distanced from the messages they have to put over .
327624:45	Well it 's interesting that er I mean these quotations get It must be very clever research .
327629:73	That was my view and still my view and I think John Major fought a very distinguished campaign er against the pundits it has to be said .
327666:34	And it tends to be I 'm sad to have to say it , it tends to be a limited number of colleagues who are totally I think , removed from the mainstream of what the majority off us want to see , who are to prepared to withhold their voted in the House of Commons .
327678:9	And you have to realize , none of us are there cos we 've got happy smiling faces .
327690:77	Now it 's perfectly true , they understand I hope rightly , within the framework and philosophy of the Conservative party , that you have to respect the integrity of the individual .
327701:9	But it has to be done with great care , infrequently It is if you like , a nuclear deterrent in that sense .
327733:9	But there has to be a degree of discretion , a degree of responsibility .
327734:76	And you cannot have a situation where the the sort of almost the norm is , Any difficult decision the government is gonna have to take , there 'll be a dozen colleagues who say , not for us .
327781:22	It comes to us , we have to put it through the House of Commons .
327794:19	It 's better not to have to have pensions than not to have pensions , surely not .
327801:112	Er I I think that with three million people out of work , we have an unemployment problem which creates erm a a disadvantage group particularly in some of the stress urban areas where we have to look at more radical solutions to what is basically the payment of cash for nothing in return .
327808:11	So the government must help ?
327809:9	The state must help ?
327833:96	Well you should y I I I er these la these these labels are so difficult to fit because if you say , Moving to the right , you then have to show me what policies the government is pursuing and you 'll probably find that I either play the part in thinking off argu arguing for them some years before some of my colleagues .
327851:16	Michael Heseltine I 'll have to stop you there , thank you very much indeed .
327872:9	The railways must be kept together say on the on the Peyton amendment and they could raise money on the private market .
327874:34	Tories who feel rebellious about the railways , may not have to push their protest to the point of voting against the government .
327886:7	We had to see what happened to these railways er is more people going to er to go by train , or are less going to go .
327904:32	Er and as you said , the only goal we had to start with was that we should turn the big losses into profit .
327912:49	The Tory whips are busy counting heads to work out whether there 'll have to be a government retreat .
327928:17	The privatization bill will probably have to go back to the upper house , whatever happens in the Commons .
328044:10	We 've had to cut prices of some of our newspapers in order to prevent a decline in circulation .
328045:32	Er and I suspect some of our competitors may have to do so as well .
328058:47	In a sense , the Jury 's still out on the Times cos you 'd have to look at it over say a three of four month period .
328064:24	I believe that you that you must never stand still in newspapers , you have to keep committing , you have to keep expanding and you halve to go with trends and there is a trend for this kind of publication .
328064:47	I believe that you that you must never stand still in newspapers , you have to keep committing , you have to keep expanding and you halve to go with trends and there is a trend for this kind of publication .

328087:35	Butt what 's at stake is whether the Independent has to raise capital again , and whether it could do so without someone else taking control .
328095:126	What the Independent very badly needs is very solid professional newspaper management er to go along with the good franchise which it has created erm and a proper owner who can actually er do what all of us in newspapers have to do from times to times which is back a promising newspaper .
328156:84	Workplace stress is on the increase , and ironically it 's now being widely recognized that companies own efforts to cut staff and become leaner and fitter , must take part of the blame .
328164:30	In that case , big firms and their insurers would have to sit up and take notice or pay the consequences .
328198:20	here they believe the problem has to be tackled at the lower levels of the organization .
328263:16	So the state has no had to tighten up the law to cut the cost .

328448:125	I I cannot see that it can have because it was n't actually put to him but he did mention twice in his judgement that he was aware of this new material and as Neil Bennet said , we 'll have to wait and see what that is .
328468:37	We still face tremendous challenges there are stumbling blocks which must be overcome .

328668:21	Clearly any deliberation of future policy has to look and look very responsibly and comprehensively er both at the question of the commitments that our armed forces have er and the best way in which we can carry out those commitments .
328685:21	Defence committee members believe the government must decide on a foreign policy first .
328688:8	We must get a balance between commitments and resources , and we 'll only get that when we have a full scale review of Britain 's defence obligations , both present and future .
328701:54	With this shock news as well there 's going to be a lot more redundancies which has got to be bad for Plymouth and the economy of Plymouth as well .

328798:9	The police had to revers their patrol car down lane three to try and warn other motorists of the danger .
328799:12	A policeman then had to bring the traffic in all three lanes to a standstill while the motorist and his passenger crossed to safety .
328800:52	The police simply cautioned the man , but they say that with so many vehicles having had to break and swerve , it 's a miracle there was n't a serious accident .
328830:71	Today , Baroness Thatcher , who formed a close relationship with President Reagan while in office , said any breakdown in the relationship must be mended .

329703:41	When I took him in he was at such a stage he had to go in in a wheelchair .
329729:36	But then once the computer 's got that , you just have to say , pretend I 'm standing here , and the computer 's capable of saying , This is what you would see .
329784:26	The police service themselves recognize that there has to be a a need for change that they have to be brought up to date er and er I think you 'll see when I a announce my decisions on the Sheahy report er that er I am taking the need to er reform the police service , very seriously indeed .

330018:44	It 's once you try and when you think , Well they must be real and I 'm missing the point .
330478:23	Which I would not like to have to work out .
330489:9	So we must have raised that to the power three .
330642:18	So something that you had to multiply by itself and get five of them all multiplied together and it equals two .
330849:13	I would have had to change it
331009:39	Yeah it only clicked as you 'd gone , when I had to do it .
331224:10	do n't have to go that far , six seconds say .
331286:47	Oh that 's about the answer in the back of the book , so I must have just gone wrong on the last bit here .
331325:7	I must admit .
331337:17	And you you you have to sort of attack it in that way .
331599:7	You have to twist it about a bit .
331603:13	So you 'd have to start looking for these patterns , but you need to build up to those , build up your experience so that you 've seen them .
331770:58	she was nearly retiring by the , no still the girls go to her at the school so she must have been going for , two or three years after we came up here , but I would be in the choir just , maybe two or three years .

331968:23	music as well though if you had to ?
331971:12	No I would have to learn the tune like by listening to the

332018:46	They have a serious side but they must have a lighter side as well , must n't they ?
332020:9	But you must really enjoy singing to yourself , you must find that something
332020:35	But you must really enjoy singing to yourself , you must find that something
332043:45	Well when Margaret suggested er doing a project on French polishing , I had to admit that I did n't really know what French polishing was .
332071:13	So And you have to do n't use too much oil and you use the oil on it you know , and then when you get what we call a good body on it , that 's when all the pores is filled up .
332079:14	See that would have to be all darkened down that See that light bit of the wood , that 's got to be all darkened down and brought up The colours is all sort of you see , matching and that .
332085:106	So however And then you start you 've got to start and use very little polish and very little methylated spirits and what we call to work out the the all that oil has to be lifted out and it 's you dra it 's you work in circles and work in circles cos that fills in the pores and then near when you 're on maybe bout the last th th takes about three or four coats you know , working on it All depends just how how how long it takes to get it filled up .
332130:33	different people you say , Oh my , your house must be lovely Mrs .
332132:25	And she used to say , I had to run and shut all the doors .
332146:41	But er you used to say , Oh Mrs , Oh your place must be lovely .
332184:10	Now it must have been er it was during the war .
332230:181	No you could n't I mean er at you know the the doors would n't be open be I mean you know , you could picture a wardrobe without a door , but you were working you were sandpapering that on the inside and er maybe brushing it up and down and then sandpapering that again and then they had to go over with what we call the rubber .
332246:180	Something to do with som something to do with a cotton mill in Paisley and it was s s s W I c just cannae recall what it was but it was a great big trial , there was a And er this this lawyer he had done quite well out of this case but it was a quite That must have been in er about nineteen twenty nineteen thirties about nineteen thirty two .
332283:73	It would take about er it would take about three days like to to really give it and then it would have to lie for a wee while to to harden you know , the polish to harden .
332414:89	But er and other times we were just we were working to you know , quite late you know if the there was a special job that had to be out you know .
332572:65	But we used to get sent out to after the stuff left out the the shop , we used to have to go maybe touch up anything
332614:15	I suppose there must have been something associated er you know , the French would proba they were really first in the field with all these sort of
332622:9	But it must have been something connected to the the French when the they said it was French polishing .
332639:28	Before before we could get nationalization , we had to get a Labour government .
332656:11	Because you must remember during the wars , the railway stocks were being run down .
332663:104	Because there was a great Tory voice sounded throughout the press and the mass media you see , that er on compensation for the railways , if there ever should be nationalization that they had to be amply compensated you see .
332667:9	No we had to be fair , was the saying , for the leaders .
332668:8	We have to be fair , we 've got to give them the compensation .
332671:10	It would have to be renewed as soon as the the nationalization was prepared to go , the government took over .
332735:7	He must have agreed to all this .
332796:28	When he appeared in the yard , you had to jump it .
332820:28	So anyway , that was it , you had to go to your branch and complain , make your protest in writing , see , and the branch secretary would reply to your letter okay , And they 'd ask for maybe a few more details about the complaint .
332889:7	You had to pay them five shillings a visit to the doctor , and then your spectacles or any dental treatment you got , you had to pay for them .
332889:79	You had to pay them five shillings a visit to the doctor , and then your spectacles or any dental treatment you got , you had to pay for them .
332890:27	A shilling a week you know you had to pay out .
332911:12	Mind you must remember at the time when he was fighting to put it through , the bill through parliament , the whole B M A , British Medical Association were against him , to a man .
332973:37	Now duty rosters , trains , all the different trains that have got to be clean you see , and I was putting in ten minutes less than really would be required you see , and that saved er hours you see , saved hours .
333135:105	So it was quite a simple job and of course , as yard inspector at Street , my job was to see that the s platforms were always When one train left you had to put the other train in to get the shunters to shunt another train into the empty platform you see , for the next the next shunt and that and if a train came in from Carstairs you see , you seen that the pilot and phoned the signalman , let the pilot into number five dock .
333276:64	So these wee things I I knew and er my staff soon found you see that well they just had to go along and do the job as it should be done , you see , and they were no good at kidding me that it had been done , for I used to examine everything that was done you see .
333378:41	That 's just That 's a long time to be You must be the oldest family in do you think .
333498:15	So he would have had to do quite a lot of work .
333875:10	She she had to cut the harvest one year .
333942:7	I must admit when I when I came in the door there the first thing I noticed was the peat smell .
333995:11	Did you not have to be off the ground a wee bit or something .
334081:10	And would had to make food for them and stuff like that ?
334158:32	Yes that was counted in it too and it had to be well parked .
334406:35	Well a way back in the last century they they had to go looking for a life a living elsewhere because of the poverty of the place .
334523:7	I must find out about that .
334647:9	And they had to watch there for six weeks .
334648:55	There 'd be tonight , now for tomorrow night , the two that was on tonight had to find the next two .
334652:15	If not they would have to stay on another night .
334654:59	But they would only get two you see , and they would go on and that two would have to find another two to go on the following night .
334837:21	I do n't believe So that must have died generation .
334847:19	Everybody says that so it must be true .
334872:59	Well like all the the ground was all cultivated and you had the had like all the Summertime you had to fence the the hens off the the cultivated land .
334905:54	And some years you 'd probably maybe get a few pounds back and sometimes you would er maybe have to pay a few pounds .
334919:14	And you did n't have to
334939:7	That must have been an awful lot of hens then .
335008:25	Well er the money was not you had to buy the and the there were nothing in it unless you went into choosing a a big system like the battery system .
335021:41	hens who were once the oats were so were sown they had to they were closed down and that .
335257:19	And do you remember You must remember sort of changes in the chemicals that were you know , that was used on the land in the in the time that you were .
335277:31	Aye , and if it was very dry you had to tramp it down with your feet .
335292:9	Then you had to flitt them every day when the wool started to get loose on them you had to the tether would get in a and you had to clear their tethers .
335292:63	Then you had to flitt them every day when the wool started to get loose on them you had to the tether would get in a and you had to clear their tethers .
335292:94	Then you had to flitt them every day when the wool started to get loose on them you had to the tether would get in a and you had to clear their tethers .
335371:9	So you had to wait
335399:7	That must have gone on a lot
335407:51	They expect you to get on They tell you what to do and you had to make the best .
335408:7	It must have been a long day for a boy of that age .
335440:86	Well they were usually a line of kids standing along the wall or something and one set out in the middle of the field and then you had to touch them and then you 'd be back to the wall and they had to do it .
335440:131	Well they were usually a line of kids standing along the wall or something and one set out in the middle of the field and then you had to touch them and then you 'd be back to the wall and they had to do it .
335522:7	It must have been a big difference when the plane was .
335573:34	Sister will always be remembered for her words , You must be cruel to be kind .
335739:9	But they must have taken an awful lot of barrels away .
335748:28	And then when the herring went away they had to load them again .
335872:28	Well this frocks never arrived and she just had to put on an ordinary er white blouse you see and a skirt and the frocks arrived the next day and she put them back .
335990:87	And there was the beds that was there there was beds were still in that bothy and there was there were three of them must have been in the bed you see , and then there was a a board that they slipped in half up the bed and there was a a mattress or whatever on that and another three on that .
336148:63	just last year you see cos nineteen twenty four it start and Stronsay was well on the first to have to start the W I .
336205:98	putting folk there and come back , and putting them and coming back and he then he did , that was four loads he would have had you see and then had to take them all back home again .
336240:45	And he used to come and they could see him coming for he had to come in a cart .
336266:13	Now you just have to tell me about that that peedie er shop again Vera .
336275:34	So that folk maybe in the sort of parish did n't have to walk into the village to get it .
336315:22	And so that the folk would n't have to trudge into the to to buy their stuff .
336416:10	It wo must have been I mean that was if you to get completely new clothes every time , that would have been an amazing expense would n't it .
336548:9	And he had to be dressed in his Sunday best when he went round .
336733:7	they must have
336836:9	Or would have to would he ?
336838:12	Whether he had to walk or whether I do n't know .
337062:35	Cos there was n't a regulation afore about how deep they had to be .
337108:32	He was a joiner and on the islands the joiners had to do undertaking .
337131:33	Well he star I think probably the first He must have been a joiner for a wee while before he was you were just asked to do this the same I suppose as any other job any other joiner job
337150:51	the pit and the the circular with a saw you know , the wood , they had to go down in a in a pit .
337172:20	Oh well he he he had to take on a oh he could easily afford it because he was paid about five shillings in the year .
337184:12	he did n't have to .
337194:11	And then they had to be a for a certain length of time before they would be a master joiner .
337200:9	Did he have to kind of sort of did he look on that as a profession to do beside the farming or did he
337204:9	So did have to take them
337238:18	You just did what had to be done .
337241:7	it had to be done .
337248:10	and er had to measure up the body because the coffins were made to measure .
337250:8	He had to go and they would I think actually sometimes had to lay out the body as well .
337250:42	He had to go and they would I think actually sometimes had to lay out the body as well .
337305:11	for the sides had to be shaped .
337307:9	Well these had to be bent you see and they they saw a wee bit through them .
337310:12	But they also had to bend then .
337365:44	Oh no they would come right away you see , because the body would have to be laid out when it was er
337378:77	Between because before they got he went away and measured up the body and he also had sometime then you see he would have to go and put the body in the coffin .
337379:33	And before the funeral the they would he would probably have to take a window out of the house .
337381:13	Because the coffin had to come out of the stayed in the house the b the
337387:89	I mean you like the ordinary houses are , there 's no room and you could not bend the coffin with a person in it so they would have to take the window or the bedroom or wherever the corpse was
337389:76	They took it out and sort of temporarily fixed it in so that they could get this out at the funeral and then he had to go back later and fix the window in .
337395:46	Just to to to put the coffin into the house , the would n't have to take a window out to put the coffin in
337424:12	That did n't have to be sewn on by hand then
337454:12	And that also had to be done by hand .
337455:49	Father used to do that , he would sit in the evening then and he had to scratch on this b it was a like a tin plate with a black sort of area to scratch
337465:20	And another thing that sometimes had to be done was writing out off er the they did n't put er notices in shop windows or anything .
337474:17	And you would the name had to be filled in and the time and the details .
337483:11	But sometimes that had to be written out as well at the house .
337549:92	I remember one funeral when I was a little girl at the school , was an old man who died , Benji he was I think he must have been the best the last in Orkney .
337608:52	Except I mean , if anybody thought they were oak cokin th coffin that would have to come from somewhere else .
337634:40	So what happened if somebody die off the island , did they have to send them
337806:24	The family had you see the family had to come and tell him where the grave was .
338092:52	and er he he used to ring the bell and he used to clean he had to clean the church and all the rest of it you know .
338108:13	So he 'd have to dig the grave by himself .
338118:18	Oh yes , mother mother had to work hard
338122:12	And er she had to pluck them and everything , clean them ready to put in the oven you know .
338125:9	And we had to run to take these chickens
338180:9	Did you have to pay rent for the house ?
338182:9	Did you have to pay rent ?
338184:9	Did you have to pay rent ?
338261:16	Did you used to have to milk the cows ?
338330:15	How far might he have to travel to dig a grave ?
338340:24	Erm so he would he would have to dig the graves .
338341:12	And would he have to keep the churchyard ?
338482:12	So you 'd have to deliver them ?
338485:7	You had to deliver them ?
338580:8	We had to hold them and father put them
338602:9	Did he have to poach to get the rabbit ?
338604:9	Did he have to poach to get the rabbits ?
338616:10	He 'd have to have a licence to have pheasants .
338714:7	We had to go to school for we were young .
338761:9	Did you have to walk there .
338770:9	Did you have to live at ?
338772:9	Did you have to live at ?
338774:9	Did you have to sleep in ?
338783:32	And they used to catch pheasants and er I had to clean I had to pluck these pheasants and er birds and get them ready and ready for them to put in the oven .
338783:48	And they used to catch pheasants and er I had to clean I had to pluck these pheasants and er birds and get them ready and ready for them to put in the oven .
338801:14	Erm would you have to do a lot of cleaning work as well in the kitchens ?
338878:16	Did you used to have to wear a uniform ?
338929:44	Can you tell me about erm a typical days work that you would have to do .
338930:23	Can you remember what you 'd have to do ?
338931:40	Oh w when I first went to to place I I had to er I had to clean er clean I had to I was like a scullery maid .
338931:55	Oh w when I first went to to place I I had to er I had to clean er clean I had to I was like a scullery maid .
338931:76	Oh w when I first went to to place I I had to er I had to clean er clean I had to I was like a scullery maid .
338938:28	Erm what time in the morning would you have to get up ?
338980:7	I had to or all I could go somewhere else .
339032:33	Did you ever think it was unfair that you had to work so hard for so little money ?
339035:7	We had to .
339074:30	And they used to they used to I had to I had to pluck them and clean them ready to put in the oven . .
339074:41	And they used to they used to I had to I had to pluck them and clean them ready to put in the oven . .
339181:13	Oh no We had to look for work .
339182:7	You had to ?
339195:9	Would you have to erm did they used to have dinner parties as well there ?
339222:7	I had to I had to lay the table and they had to be laid spick and span you know .
339222:18	I had to I had to lay the table and they had to be laid spick and span you know .
339222:39	I had to I had to lay the table and they had to be laid spick and span you know .
339225:8	Everything had to be it you know .
339253:14	Oh they they had to go to service .
339254:15	They all went and had to go to service ?
339306:25	When he stopped working , did he have to leave the church house ?
339319:9	So they had to share one wage between three of them ?
339411:9	So I had to
339555:12	But I actually have to get home , you know , yes , probably you do n't have those pressures on you .
339662:87	Erm , now some of you , you know , er , this is a big company , you probably have very intricate expense forms type things that you have to do , but if you want to , kindly note that you can analyse your expenses on the front of the envelopes
339666:210	So I know a guy for example who , when he gets his Visa bill say the last third of the month , he puts it into the envelope , and makes a note in the diary on say the twenty first , to pay the Visa bill , and when he gets to the twenty first , lo and behold , he knows where the Visa bill is and he has to pay it .
339687:45	No , no you do n't need to open it , just , you have to , you ca n't possibly .
339757:9	And I have to warn you , coming back to the Emperor 's birthday , that I suspect , because these come from Allentown , Pennsylvania , otherwise known as that erm , they , they have n't actually twigged to the fact , that erm , Hirohito died erm , so it , it , if you are concerned with Japan , you might want to check when Akohito 's birthday actually is , erm , because it may not be the same one as in our , our diaries .
339777:83	Obviously it 's the human condition that you never actually ever finish all the things that are on your to do list , so you always have to reschedule things .
339791:22	Please note that you do not have to open the rings to put these markers over , though you should after you 've done it the first time , erm , it should become easier with practice , let me put it that way , okay .
339817:11	And these things have to be instantly recognisable .
339821:19	So whatever you use has to be instantly recognisable .
339833:130	Now as part of an annual goal which is to run some public courses later on in the year , erm , I 've broken that down in a way that I may go through later , to things that I have to do on , on a month by month basis , and this month I need to create the mailing list .
339838:44	Erm , they write down nothing , they remember nothing , and I have to phone these clowns every other day , to make sure that they 're doing what we agreed they 're going to , otherwise I have no panels next month for my stand , and I would be up the creek .
339846:21	Er , I do n't physically have to type out the labels , but I have physically have to be in the office , to initiate the computer sorts , because under something called personal job insurance scheme , I 've layered the sort of routine under a lot of security codes and I 'm only , the only person who knows where they are .
339846:52	Er , I do n't physically have to type out the labels , but I have physically have to be in the office , to initiate the computer sorts , because under something called personal job insurance scheme , I 've layered the sort of routine under a lot of security codes and I 'm only , the only person who knows where they are .
339847:97	Er , which means I ca n't be fired without a great deal of hassle , er , but , I er , er , the kind of the down-side is I have to go to the office occasionally .
339901:85	What happened is at the beginning of last year , Yvonne said to me er , we have lived in this house for three years , we must decorate it .
339966:12	Er , you must then go through the month and work out , either on the monthly calendar card , or on the daily pages when you 're actually going to do this stuff on this list .
340025:8	I have to go back a stage , I have n't actually explained what these four to you , on this page you 've got four boxes .
340044:122	I have a meeting with a software house at ten thirty , Mike is coming in at three thirty to talk about the new book , and tonight 's one of the nights when Yvonne is teaching , so I have to be home by a reasonable hour , so that we can exchange car keys and padlock keys and that sort thing .
340084:149	Er , I used not to do that , I used to put everything in one list , and then my home telephone was cut off one time , er , because I just never regarded the personal things as being terribly important until , you know , I do n't have to pay well over a hundred quid to get the thing fixed again .
340132:32	If you make the same mistake , er , you have to buy another set , and I double the price for people who have heard me say do n't do this , er , and lie low , you know in the first three months , because I believe in penalising stupidity .
340224:65	Erm , how often do you go to a meeting or have you been to a meeting , which has to stop for twenty minutes because some clown has left the files in his office , and he has to go back and retrieve them .
340224:117	Erm , how often do you go to a meeting or have you been to a meeting , which has to stop for twenty minutes because some clown has left the files in his office , and he has to go back and retrieve them .
340248:61	So if you 're wandering around and you want to write somebody a quick note , you do n't have to open the rings and take out a piece of paper , you just write on here and tear it off .
340302:82	So that when we have the thing that he calls an annual review and I call a pain in the neck , I do n't actually have to put in very much work to come up with the fact that no , I 'm not going to give him a salary increase , erm , because I have his , his performance , you know , already researched throughout the year .
340336:41	Erm , I was wondering if , you know , and then you have to come up with a solution , because bosses do n't like problems , they like solutions .
340339:116	Er , let me say also , of course , some bosses , you know , are , are , are sad souls , they need a little bit more of a jolt , at which point you have to put it in monetary terms .
340357:186	You know , so I , I mean , I talked about this before , this is a mailing that I want to do in October , which means for example , that I 've got to print the catalogue in July , which means I 've got to proof it in June , which means I have to actually design it in April and May .
340415:13	Sec secondly we must welcome Paul to the meeting , as you know he joined us at the beginning of January to run the neighbourhood watch schemes and as office manager I thought it appropriate he attend the management meetings .
340522:49	Add to that the new guidelines that suggest that all er plans for major developments must go through the hands of an A L O and really we do n't have an answer for it , and if we are going to be getting 9 new civilian C P O 's they 're gonna have their work cut out learning their basic craft before they even develop their A L O skills .
340525:166	So we will not have the capacity to deal with A L O work to the extent that we would like , there 's no doubt that poor David over there is gonna get a lot more work on his desk as a result of that , and it 's just something we 're gonna have to live with in the short term .
340616:14	No he , he must continue doing what he has got time to do .
340620:10	We 'll have to say sorry Bill you know w send them down to Dave if Dave 's got time to pull ' em in he will do , if not we 'll you know we 'll have to reply negative .
340620:124	We 'll have to say sorry Bill you know w send them down to Dave if Dave 's got time to pull ' em in he will do , if not we 'll you know we 'll have to reply negative .
340695:18	change their mind , there must be there must be nine other posts that if they look round they could civilianise not I mean they have n't got to tell the public much it have they you still talk about the same amount of officers being civilianised .
340695:27	change their mind , there must be there must be nine other posts that if they look round they could civilianise not I mean they have n't got to tell the public much it have they you still talk about the same amount of officers being civilianised .
340892:43	and the posters will all be there neatly in rows and all they have to do is smile is smile and er shake a few hands
340931:87	yeah , we 've lost an enormous amount of staff probably a third of our staff disappeared in the last twelve months , and I think y you we must recognise it 's bound to make an impact and here we are sitting here feeling a bit shell shocked and that 's no doubt one of the contributory factors .
341068:112	Get yourself on the course that Paul went on and you 're gonna be getting the kit soon anyway , as part of the network , it wo n't give you stand alone , but you have to have somebody on the network
341086:80	But the thing is that your er particular area you know , if you wanted to do one and not save it , you do n't have to save , you know , you know you can print it off and it 's done , but you can send mail to Tracey or headquarters C A , you would n't have to print it out once it 's what you want you just press a button and it goes .
341086:182	But the thing is that your er particular area you know , if you wanted to do one and not save it , you do n't have to save , you know , you know you can print it off and it 's done , but you can send mail to Tracey or headquarters C A , you would n't have to print it out once it 's what you want you just press a button and it goes .
341130:245	Er the reason we wanna get it right is because er this Superintendent , erm he 's obviously got his interests very much on it , and he 's he 's keen to know what our response is going to be , and if it were just a member of the public I think we could we could being crude I think we could fob ' em off , but I think it 's gonna have to be a very structured answer as to why we 're not gonna do it .
341143:26	Well that 's , but the referral has to be done by the juvenile liaison
341465:7	You must get into the habit of diverting it yourselves , before we start shouting at everybody else
341470:121	I do intend to er to attend inaugural meetings with each of the C P O s er with a view to looking I mean obviously at some stages you said to me that I would probably have to attend at short notice
341507:98	Well it should be in the file and I asked for this and keep it before me when a scheme is set up , A we have a map which I must have sent out letters ,
341535:101	So great , let 's communicate with any other deputies and say if you 're not prepared to take it over we 'll close the we 're afraid the scheme will have to close down .
341559:18	I still think we have to have the system as such , perhaps not so intricate , but certainly keep the file probably with the bits in
341605:22	What about civilian staff , I have to assess my staff , I have n't had no training .
341650:14	But they 're gonna have to find him
341653:7	You have to wait until all the transit vans are out and double parked put it across across the transit van bays
341735:29	So you 're clear what you 're gonna have to do yeah ?
341892:32	and out of that thirty thousand pounds what do you have to pay out ?
341928:46	Bearing that in mind , which of these do you think you 'll have to give up ?
341943:49	Yeah I might need them more mind you but yeah I suppose holidays would have to go yeah , I 'd go along with that yeah .
341949:11	that you have to pay out .
341974:14	Well the insurance would have to go as well as I could n't afford to keep that going .
341987:30	I mean ideally you would n't want to have to , to go down to less than three thousand pounds a year
342008:45	okay , which would be an option to make sure that you did n't have to resort to this three thousand pounds a year
342110:50	Erm went through and , and , and got into take out all the things you have to do , do away with and so on .
342143:141	Erm I was n't quite certain of the wife 's P H I there was something about twelve months and she was getting a hundred and thirty pounds er I , I lost it because I was looking at the clock at the same , I must confess but erm
342316:7	I have to say because erm but you 'll get technical feedback on the areas you 've got wrong .
342322:46	erm obviously the priority is to get the feedback to the people that have to resit the exam
342490:15	Well obviously I 'll have to give you the illustrations .
342521:35	Now providing your happy with these recommendations er do you have to consult anyone else er
342621:198	Fair enough he may have had a very good reason for doing so but I thought that that would have been a typical apack erm he did say well you know I just want to run it by him , you know , just to make sure but you , you still needed to know why he thought that his accountant had to be involved .
342684:19	That 's it you have to put it in the simplest of terms and that is the way that most people would understand it , you know , you come to sixty five or whatever and instead of having three hundred pounds a week you 've got eighty five pounds a week and what are you going to do about it .
342728:232	You 've gotta probe and establish the reasons why I 'm gonna talk to him and most people it 's , it 's , it 's a lie , they 're not gonna talk to him , they want to use the accountant as a reason to say oh erm I 'm , I ca n't do it this time the accountant said no or I 've not spoken to him yet I 'll have to put it off for a , for a bit longer
342733:129	How serious are you about being able to retire with some dignity and being able to continue doing the things you 've always wanted to er the things you 've been able to enjoy doing but you 'll have to give up .
342763:53	What did Peter Lilley say the other day , you know , that er you 'll have to provide
342828:15	Where where do you have to come from ?
342839:12	Well I had to come down , I had to come , I erm went down to Bishop 's Stortford and in fact
342839:30	Well I had to come down , I had to come , I erm went down to Bishop 's Stortford and in fact
342855:15	What time did you have to be here yesterday ?
342905:25	So you had , you , you had to get it all down , you know , do everything by yourself ?
343150:73	the idea was there and the structure and everything was there it was just that you had n't actually explained what you had to do first , you know , to come back with the erm recommendations erm but you did , you did get the date confirmed to come back for the second appointment which was good .
343162:219	I think it w it can get a little bit over elaborated and I think that may be well fear of the C C Q or fear of the buyer 's guide but it , it should n't cause any problems in the real world and I think the more you do then you 'll realize that er they 're not gonna say oh my goodness me stop , leave now , I must speak to an independent financial adviser .
343207:47	I 've got a handout for this one , What would you and your family have to give up in retirement if you 'd made inadequate provision ?
343225:45	Yeah ? for life insurance , savings er any , any erm investment product we have to offer or based on and around that because they 're all open probes and you 're gaining his thoughts and feelings .
343427:269	Summarize those needs cos there may be more than one and tell him what you 're gonna do , what is the plan of attack , when you 're gonna see the guy again and when we do our business building up , you can take it back to erm the benefits of him introducing us to other people by keeping policy charges down and increasing bonuses whenever possible , cos it 's in his benefit he introduces us to others so we do n't have to advertise , or very very rarely advertise .
343439:74	This part of the selling process is directed towards finding out about your client and completing the C C Q. With all clients you must attempt to complete all relevant areas of the C C Q. This includes gathering hard facts , date of birth , marital status , dependants , hobbies and so on .
343442:37	And when you 're about to complete the C C Q you must make it clear that the information given to you and subsequently transferred to the C C Q is in strictest confidence .
343476:36	You see these are the sorts of issues we must address to ensure you can maintain your current lifestyle .
343505:21	Oh I guess she 'd have to invest it .
343534:24	At the end of this process you must establish how important each area is to your client .
343552:37	Well we 're going on holiday next week so it will have to be after that .
343572:42	ANNA is a mnemonic for authority , needs , now and amount and has to be introduced at the end of the first appointment .
343596:55	So in groups B and C role play it 'll be your nominated product , okay you wo n't have to do one on savings yeah ?
343603:17	Excuse me I just have to rush over here for no real reason and touch something and rush back again .
343633:21	Everyone okay with what they have to do with regards to their respective role plays ?
343646:94	Now this will definitely test your listening skills and , I know it 's getting late in the afternoon and you 've had a heavy meal , but you really do have to concentrate because the feedback you give him is now , or her rather , is now vitally important , okay , cos you have n't got a second bite of the cherry .
343652:22	Is everyone clear what they have to do ?
344171:62	So you do need to look at that page very carefully and I still get tied up sometimes and have to do a few crossings out .
344391:18	Yeah that , no that must , that is right .
344545:31	Wait till I see what you or Steve has to say .
344631:35	And that instantly brings , you start thinking oh he must be alright cos if Joe 's done business with him
344718:112	Yeah we thought it important to send to you because we are , you know , a bit out of the way that 's all and erm people tend to go zipping past and have to go up to the roundabout and come all the way back down again cos it 's quite a busy road this and
344745:11	Oh God , must be six possibly seven years now when I took the policy out originally I think .
344769:15	now there , there must 've been one reason why you chose Friends Provident .
345013:85	I think I 'd talk to them first and if they 're agreeable then I 'd give you their name and telephone number but I 'd have to speak to them first but I would n't just give out the name and telephone number on an ad hoc basis .
345091:190	Erm you closed questioned which I thought Martin made very difficult for you but er obviously intentionally but erm what else is it you mentioned erm pension or benefits from the navy , you never actually picked up on whether he had any erm pension benefit from , from the forces which is something that , that we would have had to have made a note of .
345112:30	He actually corrected it later on when he has to go back into it but , you know , just , just a wee point there erm you did , did it initially but corrected it later on when you , you came back into it .
345130:97	there was no sort of , you know , about handshake or anything daft like that he just , he just would n't let go of my hand so I had to pull off really .
345142:105	so I wanted to try and go for the C C Q , this is it , this is what we 're gonna ask you and of course it did n't work but I had to try it to see .
345197:73	So I think if you have a plan of attack which you feel works better for you then I think you must run it by your manager first of all to get his agreement before you
345267:32	It was right at the very beginning when you had to ask him about the introduction , I thought you were going straight off from the business card and all the rest of it and what you actually had was your C C Q in front of you because it took you all that time to get round to it .
345345:59	and er analogist principal applies in relation to article eighty six and to this article the effect upon trade must flow from the abuse , however , the definition of the market arises in relation to establishing dominants , there are many cases which established , the market in which an undertaking is dominant need not be the same market as where the abuse occurred accordingly to establish an article of eighty six case , dominants may be proven in a market where there is no effect upon trade .
345359:47	my Lord well no doubt then the answer is that erm that would eventually have to meet them through funds which they will bring in to the market and which will go into the , the central fund
345369:106	my Lord we se , I do n't think that 's true because what we 're saying and if and I believe it does flair from our keepers that erm we have to prove we 've got to prove that these restrictions would of lead to category of business from what the
345391:222	erm well it does n't necessary apply that the agent is suing the name , the question is whether , what any right the agent has got , er the fact of the matter is as I understand it and tell me if I 'm wrong , that your client has erm received a demand under clause nine er , er which he has failed to comply , I think that must follow because er if he had complied with it , then that would never of got as far as the central fund
345392:22	of yes , I think it must be
345423:46	so then if we go back to the beginning of this discussion Mr , it must follow must it not that there is a risk , clause nine is inaccurable so as far as all names are
345423:52	so then if we go back to the beginning of this discussion Mr , it must follow must it not that there is a risk , clause nine is inaccurable so as far as all names are
345428:23	My Lord the , the answer must be yes
345431:196	but then , is , does it not , the next point then does not er what Mr say have relevant cause , because if there is this risk which in the purposes of the argument rule , start if you like as a wheel and not a , a , a , a , a fanciful risk , the reasons yourself just put forward , er then it must follow that there is a risk , er that erm the members agents will not be able to call on names to provide the funds
345446:46	well my Lord previous policy , pass policy holders have been paid , all have to do in relation to the future is very rapidly notify their arrangements , if they get clearance they can then get exemption from the data notification back dated and the problems for the future are resolved .
345451:62	well my Lord certain believers well certainly that may give rise to problems , erm , and then one may have to resolve those on the basis of the ostensible authority or even claims against the member of state under article ten of the directive , but , however , erm , on , on satisfactory or confusing to the market that might be
345454:75	have it within their power to resolve the matter very speedily by going to the commission and providing full notification , even if they have to negotiate with the commission over provisions which the submission was moved , then they can get that exemption back dated and , and
345465:43	you 're probably right , but the point remains of course and I have to have
345467:7	I have to have in mind of course some , not just F , not also correctively now C
345538:81	if there are if there are other restrictions then I say section fourteen is automatically void in it 's entirety because it reinforces , it has to be independent effect of reinforcing the other restrictions it stands behind them boosting them on
345619:157	and that , that would be because your , your twenty million pounds in it has really got no erm , had got no independent justification on arbitrary limiting a number of people able to compete , but what , what if you 're able to satisfy everybody that you had to have some pay out capital , twenty million is ridiculous
345666:218	and so provided that there 's proper procedures , I mean I do n't suppose the commission wanted to actually act as a , a review body for every person excluded from the market in Europe , and so they said well one 's got to have a certain faith in the national courts as being an independent review , and such as that person is excluded from the market there must be a very good reason and he was an a competitor
345674:73	my Lord that 's why we say it was so strict , the commission said you 're not getting exemption you have to remove everything from the market
345676:18	every , every restriction out must go and then we 'll give you clearance when it 's entirely innocuous or when , the clauses
345683:115	if they 're saying there are no restrictions , cos they cannot , they simply cannot give there good clearance if there was something which is something of a restriction of competition , they must give exemption , they have no jurisdiction to do anything else , if they look at a clause and say
345689:17	so you say it must be implicit in that decision that the , the commission was satisfied that the objective criteria er would separate the sheep from the goats , erm so that no one who would , would be excluded who was capable of competing
345690:19	my Lord that , that must be right because that would only be the way in which they could give negative clearance , because the clause or the membership rules were inappreciable
345698:65	two , of regulation seventeen , perhaps I 'd just give you the reference in er I 'm sure it must be there , page , page twelve , one , one is regulation seventeen
345718:111	erm , erm it might not be erm particularly helpful , but having thought about it again I , I quite like you , in , at least in broad outline er to hear what you have to say on the aspect orusese gnitteg ton er ' uoy dias
345720:109	I 'm sorry about that , it really is more of a second thought , although I do n't want to go into any detail and I 'd like , like any broad that you have to be in my mind in this case at least
345730:57	well this case I 'm afraid does n't lend itself to short entirely impossible , er Mr maybe have to say erm will lead to the questions and then for example spent er a long time on questions this afternoon that I 've had for you Mr
345762:39	would you like , would you like to hear what I have to say on that one Mr er do you want ?
345763:57	erm , well I think probably better , better for everybody to , to hear what he has to say
345781:57	in the region of twenty months and two years , erm , in those circumstances my Lord er the issue must arise in the interim er is er able er to re-claim money for the central fund , these are monies that are as your Lordship knows under article ten , payable forthwith on demand and in the interim can it rely on the statutory effect of section fourteen of the act
345812:49	by the divisional court and er it was a case where the divisional court er had to er consider what it should do in the interim , the Lord Justice er in the divisional court judgement deals with the interim position at er page twenty five of the transcript , starting at letter F and er going through to er page twenty eight paragraph B and I think it might help my Lord if you could read that passage in the justice latest judgment .
345980:24	Just a quick house , it does n't have to be a masterpiece .
346035:31	Who , who said anything management-wise , that had to be done ? and she 's just a student
346045:80	I ca n't do anything with him , yet this other kid 's absolutely brilliant , and I think it 's a shame that I 've had to leave , like let the temps .
346048:10	It 'll have to be sorted out .
346064:108	You know , I 'd done the section manager part-time , I 've done the Saturday 's and Sunday 's , I 've done the share , the fair share of shoving the shit when I had to erm , but , I think you can get a lot of average streams , there is a lot of potential there for one to become a very valued member of staff .
346067:121	Yes , if you can , if you can recognise it , or if you 've got , or if , several members of erm , several students we had when I was on grocery at Camden , we had to , I think it was twenty eight on Saturday afternoon , they might have been on checkouts , well I mean , they 're still scheduled to my , I 'm saying out of that about four of them er , are still working at Camden full-time .
346093:56	They 're always the ones that are a bit more boisterous , whereas the older ones you have to physically carry on in the shop floor , the students do n't , and that 's what gives them a bad name .
346135:100	I think there 's a danger that you can go over the top with praise , in that you 're anxious to give quality feedback , the thing that you have to be careful with is that it 's not just meaningless like that , because that can be just as bad as giving negative feedback .
346246:50	Things like that are not constructive at all , I mean I know you must get to the stage with some members of staff where you think oh , what else can I do , but
346289:9	But you must get borderline cases from time to time .
346290:30	Grey sheep as it were , where you have to exercise your powers of discretion ?
346389:90	Er , now look Barbara , I know you have n't been in the job as long as the other two , but er , really you 're going to have to do better than this I 'm afraid .
346536:7	There must be something .
346538:7	There must be something .
346602:35	No it 's too late for that now , we 'll have to start at the beginning .
346658:21	Not terribly no , so , you must define for her clearly what her responsibilities are .
346661:15	Good , then you must make her responsibilities even clearer , by defining key areas where she is to get a result .
346699:43	Then , establish the key area in which the person doing that job must achieve results , and review them regularly to make sure your employee always has the same view of the job as you do .
346722:52	No look , every employee needs to be set standards of achievement below which he must not fall .
346757:38	No fewer than ten cold calls each month , all cold call reports must be filed within seven working days of a visit , and a minimum of eighty calls to be made per month to existing customers .
346794:15	I know I have to look at it , I
346842:27	The erm , shapes , did you ever have to do that with the thingy in the middle ?
346846:12	And then you have to explain it to the person opposite you , or a long distance phone call , and say how you , , and this , because there was a colour done what I 've said , he said my colour 's completely different , and you 've propose all those colour bits , but
346850:27	And as they 're describing it , you had to draw it .
346851:9	So you had to draw it as they describe it .
346904:121	The only precondition we 've got on that , is that it 's got to be thirty seconds long , we can use whatever sound effects we like , we really , to begin with , we have got to have scripts , everybody here takes part in it has got to have a script first ,
346904:161	The only precondition we 've got on that , is that it 's got to be thirty seconds long , we can use whatever sound effects we like , we really , to begin with , we have got to have scripts , everybody here takes part in it has got to have a script first ,
346998:9	So we had to get some ways to try and get something down .
347001:17	Overall , if you had to comment , how do you think it went ?
347112:22	We erm , given that you have to do , okay , I did n't brief them as fully as I could of , and half way through I looked at it again just to make sure I had n't missed the bottom line that said , you know stand on your head instead in the park , so I just had a little read .
347131:12	Well I have to admit , with our group , the first ten minutes or was a little bit disorganised because I felt we , I came in , we set down the objects , I felt we did that well , and we were clear of the timescale from the very beginning .
347161:42	I look at all the jobs that 's got , that have to be done in the day , right , and look at which ones I should do , and then all the other jobs I just share out between the relevant people .
347170:38	Er , what kind of checks to do have , do you have to keep on that ?
347172:138	Well , with the scheduling obviously it 's checked every day , but erm , things like till results , I check every week to make sure it 's been , if she 's been , but she 's really good so , so I just have to check up .
347235:91	It 's something you have n't got planned into your day , is n't it , it 's something that comes up , and you , you have to respond to it , so you have to have time between the day , to be able to do those things .
347235:116	It 's something you have n't got planned into your day , is n't it , it 's something that comes up , and you , you have to respond to it , so you have to have time between the day , to be able to do those things .
347237:92	Erm , it 's like to keep my day planned out but , like the district manager might walk in or people might go off sick , and then you have to fill somebody in to that position .
347268:62	Things like okay , ordering possibly could be reactive and active , because yes , it 's something that has to be done every day , but if your order in spot on , that is an active task , it would improve and benefit to your , you would say that that , .
347302:13	Important , it has to be done , but it 's not as , it 's not as important as the urgent .
347309:20	Unexpected things that emerging you have to do there and then , like
347312:193	Yes , everything , a lot of things are important , and what you 're saying is true Alex , that if you do the important things when you should do them , they wo n't become urgent , but equally what Tracy says is that , is true is that you will get unexpected things cropping up where you have to drop everything .
347313:117	I tell what is urgent is a message coming down to you , you 've had a delivery team , they 're going to destroy cases of whatever , so that 's urgent , that has to be done there and then because it 's a danger to the public or whatever .
347324:97	Well your could be important first thing in the morning today , as you 're sidetracked into doing other things , then it becomes urgent does n't it , if you 've had to reposition your , and whatever .
347359:26	An everyday task is something that you have to do every day , so
347390:70	If you 've got a situation where you 're the only person around well yes , obviously you 're going to have to do it , and you ca n't , you 're not in a position where you 're able to delegate .
347414:56	If you get your books right , it 'll all happen out on the shopfloor , all the manager has to do .
347429:28	So that 's actually within procedure that you have to do that .
347448:9	So I have to say that though I at this moment very close to this in the smallest county of England I have also had experience in three other major counties in mainland England er and I have found the same experience the difficulty of finding people who will even be councillors or magistrates , let alone these other jobs that the er that the er Home Secretary seeks to find .
347449:35	My Lords in any case , the best arrangements if we have to have these extra people would be to have a number appointed er but encouraged by th the police authority itself .
347453:277	they do n't want to have some er official or or some management consultant who 's eager to get a job and get extra money paid for him by a dumb government department , if those people are going to tell us what sort of people we want on that on police authorities , I think it is total insolence and I trust that whatever happens to this Bill that that answer that was given on the 17th of January is removed and replaced by something else , if it has to be replaced at all .
347466:147	What is for sure on the basis of a judgment made in nineteen sixty-eight when my Noble friend Lord Callaghan of Cardiff er was Home Secretary , it was made quite clear that no Minister of the Crown can tell a Chief Constable , can tell him he must or mee no or must not keep observation on this place or that .
347466:161	What is for sure on the basis of a judgment made in nineteen sixty-eight when my Noble friend Lord Callaghan of Cardiff er was Home Secretary , it was made quite clear that no Minister of the Crown can tell a Chief Constable , can tell him he must or mee no or must not keep observation on this place or that .
347468:8	He must or must not prosecute this man or that , nor can any police authority tell him so , the responsibility is on him , he is answerable to the law alone .
347468:12	He must or must not prosecute this man or that , nor can any police authority tell him so , the responsibility is on him , he is answerable to the law alone .
347475:104	So , I had a look at the powers of the police authority and they 're restricted to financial and administrative responsibilities and if I took that argument further , of course the Chief Constable has to take that into account .
347524:24	Equally I believe that local communities too must feel that the police are to them if they are to give the positive help which the police need to successfully detect and prosecute the criminals who prey on them .
347528:47	And I suggest also that it is a very valuable discipline for the police to have to say to themselves when deciding policy matters , I wonder what they will think about this at the Council House .
347540:7	We have to answer an er your Lordships are in danger of getting into the mood of treating this debate as a charge with a single issue to be decided on a single voter .
347541:161	We have actually four questions and three subordinate questions which we were addressing and only one of them has been resolved so far and that is whether the Chairman of the Police Authority should be appointed by the Home Secretary or by the Authority and we are I think all have to agree that it should be by the latter .
347558:108	I have some sympathy for the Home Secretary in these matters , he is not an Officer of State who over-occupies the position for whom I normally have a great deal of sympathy I must confess , er but on this occasion I do have some sympathy .
347564:96	I think we would be wise to reflect a little longer and to think that perhaps the Government is not so far wrong in what it is saying and I have to say finally My Lords that I never in my public life , or indeed in my private life have met anybody who has said to me that their attitude towards their local police force has been in any way influenced by the fact that the members of the police authority were or were n't democratically elected .
347568:61	I , I take My Noble Friend 's point indeed , but I think nonetheless er that er I have to say that there is a degree that we put it this way of understanding of how the process works rather more informally than the manner in which my Noble Friend has put it .
347613:117	He said it would be politicise police forces and he said that this vote would be a momentous decision because it w th the Bill will do grievous damage to policing in this country and we must remove the repugnant decisions from the Bill , but I alw I did think actually that was fairly extravagant language .
347617:39	I had it the other day over s some occasion when I had to go on some t television and the reporter said what 's the Home Secretary gonna do about it .
347639:46	My Lords er that clearly is a very serious contribution to the Debate which has to be taken very seriously indeed , er an but I before er responding directly to the er er invitation from the er Minister , I , I just want to summarise very briefly what I think has been the outcome o of this Debate .
347656:62	My Lords , under those circumstances it is quite clear that the thinking which the Minister has offered us has got to cover those particular issues
347659:7	It has got to be explicit that the issue of a local authority majority and of co-option rather than the appointment is on the agenda for discussion between now
347695:143	What we do know is that I M R O asked for this information in June nineteen eighty-eight and not long afterwards I M R O granted recognition to B I M and other Maxwell Companies , all the more surprising perhaps having raised the questions whether the question must come about , did they continue with their investigation , or did they let the matter drop and perhaps you might to comment in that context .
347743:157	Er would you not say that this has shifted the onus of responsibility very much on to the financial institutions , the banks and others who had dealings with Mr Maxwell , and is n't the judge in effect saying in your interpretation er of that , that these institutions er really have got to show they were whiter than white in their dealings and actually went in and investigated him thoroughly ?
347747:20	Er Ken , you do n't have to answer that the David sitting behind you a number of er representatives of legal firms representing interest and David 's making sure it 's worthwhile coming today .
347781:84	No we do n't , erm we in principle obviously we are in favour of er there being some form of compensation scheme and that has to be regarded as erm a step forward , er it would be better if er whatever compensation scheme is gonna be introduced was introduced now and the committee recommended and not in nineteen ninety-six or whenever it may be that the legislation is enacted .
347782:116	Er but in in terms of the proposals they actually make erm we find them somewhat contradictory in that erm it says earlier on in the in the committees report that erm accrued rights must be protected erm , it does n't say accrued rights which have to be lost through misappropriation of assets must be protected .
347782:156	Er but in in terms of the proposals they actually make erm we find them somewhat contradictory in that erm it says earlier on in the in the committees report that erm accrued rights must be protected erm , it does n't say accrued rights which have to be lost through misappropriation of assets must be protected .
347782:185	Er but in in terms of the proposals they actually make erm we find them somewhat contradictory in that erm it says earlier on in the in the committees report that erm accrued rights must be protected erm , it does n't say accrued rights which have to be lost through misappropriation of assets must be protected .
347808:206	Well the proposals that are made in the in the Committees er report for funding erm seem to us acceptable with the exception of the comment we have already made erm i acceptable in the sense that they would be borne by erm all pension funds in proportion to their the size of their assets and in relation to the size of the er compensation has to be paid .
347811:106	It 's probably not to yourselves providing the compensation was paid and that 's fine , but it would be a matter of great importance to those for whom that it would have to provide the money .
347816:120	W w w we can see , you can visualise from now if we start it now , you 'd say well , everyone now knows that if anything goes wrong , this is what they will have to pay , but how are you going to take it back ?
347818:48	If something goes wrong , they do n't know what they are going to have to pay because if I 'm a pension fund manager now , I do n't know what is likely to happen in the next year which is going call on me for compensation .
347819:63	All I know is that probably during the course of the year something will happen and I might have to chip in you know , a thousand pounds or a million pounds or whatever , but I do n't know how much it 's going to be .
347832:169	They do n't want me paying d you know like their pension deferred , so if you 're serious about the fu pension fund managers paying , we 're talking y you know earlier you said four hundred and eighty million whatever it is lost , they 're paying a third , pension fund managers have got to come up with that sort of sum .
347834:167	I think the thing that sort of has really bugged me righ right from the start of this thing was that when this when the Financial Services Act was put before Parliament , everybody was told the Gower Report and everything said pensions are the same as assets , all your assets and must be protected as such .
347855:93	He er was n't the lender , he was the borrower , he went to the bank , says can I borrow this collection of treasury bonds , which he has to put pension fund assets to stock , so he 's immediately er going against his duty as a trustee cos it 's costing the pension fund money this er er excess of five to ten per cent .
347902:15	You wo n't keep have to be going off to court to find out what is the law at that moment of time .
347925:135	They are becoming a lot more common , yes when you look in the report and accounts there are far , far more of these deferred pensioners there than er than ever used to exist and it 's something which I must admit we have n't given a lot of thought to yet , but it 's something because it 's growing that we will have to address erm in our federation , we will have to address that problem .
347925:210	They are becoming a lot more common , yes when you look in the report and accounts there are far , far more of these deferred pensioners there than er than ever used to exist and it 's something which I must admit we have n't given a lot of thought to yet , but it 's something because it 's growing that we will have to address erm in our federation , we will have to address that problem .

348000:53	In short , as I said at the very beginning of this series of lectures , you must n't treat what as I say as gospel erm I am perfectly capable of being a little bit eccentric , possibly even a little bit erm original erm in my interpretations .
348081:56	Basically the burden of the Test Act was that all office holders erm all holders of public office had to take an oath of allegiance and had to erm take the sacraments in the Church of England otherwise they could n't hold public office .
348081:81	Basically the burden of the Test Act was that all office holders erm all holders of public office had to take an oath of allegiance and had to erm take the sacraments in the Church of England otherwise they could n't hold public office .
348120:17	And I think one must ask the simple question , what sort of mechanism does Locke have in mind ?
348199:61	So if you were going at sixty four , you know , about a millimetre before the sign you have to be going at fifty five a millimetre after the sign er and you can be pulled up by a State Trooper as I was pulled up , quite unjustly I felt .
348204:89	This causes all sorts of complications , I mean if you erm if you qualify as a doctor in Texas er and you go to Massachusetts you have to go through another set of examinations before they allow you to practice medicine in Massachusetts because they do n't accept automatically Texas qualifications , they re regard the ri they retain the right to determine their own standards of procedures in these sorts of areas so their own criminal and civil codes as well as their own political structures so these are major matters .
348219:35	If you go to New Hampshire , I mu I must make a study of New Hampshire some time , if you go to New Hampshire , which is a delightful place , if you go to New Hampshire , New Hampshire appears to have no taxation at all as far as I can ascertain and the most favourite er car bumper sticker in New Hampshire is taxation is theft .
348228:206	something to be dropped on from a great height as frequently as possible er particularly if it 's the G L C. In the United States , however much the federal government is irritated by the state government , it cannot attack its constitutional powers nor can it undermine its financial base so that 's a different relationship , it 's a relationship based , not on dominance , but on partnership and there has to be an understanding , a trade off between federal and er a and state government .
348232:47	Now if you think about conflict between the centre and the states you then have to ask the question well what is the centre ?
348262:101	You know Nancy was saying say no , you know , but they were , the states had become fixed dependent , chemically and financially dependent er on the federal government and that must change says Ron .
348276:200	So erm what I 'm trying to say here then is that the federal government is important , the federal government tries wherever possible to guide states into , into good practice and it offers rewards to states to comply with , with federal er guidelines so that , you know , if you want federal aid for er a particular project you have to , if you accept federal money , you have to ensure that you meet certain standards or certain conditions , but a very convenient way of enforcing civil rights er policies .
348276:231	So erm what I 'm trying to say here then is that the federal government is important , the federal government tries wherever possible to guide states into , into good practice and it offers rewards to states to comply with , with federal er guidelines so that , you know , if you want federal aid for er a particular project you have to , if you accept federal money , you have to ensure that you meet certain standards or certain conditions , but a very convenient way of enforcing civil rights er policies .
348277:174	So obviously if er if Mississippi wants some federal money for a project they 're not gonna get it unless there are civil rights provisions built into the , into the project that is , you know , you ca n't just give dole out to white people and refuse it to black people erm that there has to be equal opportunities and so on .
348285:50	pure , unadulterated , you know erm if you want this stuff then you have to raise your age of drinking I mean just er you know a , a piece of leverage or leverage as Americans say , to , to get the states to comply .
348337:103	The original objective was to liberate South Korea , it then began to unite Korea but if you raise the objective to an assault on China proper then , then you would have to quote General Ridgeway , who was a commander on the spot , er you 'd be fighting the wrong war , the wrong time and in the wrong place .
348348:34	In nineteen sixty one , prior to the crisis , the Americans had to face the rather humiliating settlement in Laos by which they accepted a communist erm er government , or at least a government which had communist members , erm Kennedy wanted to intervene in Laos but again was restrained by his British ally , MacMillan would n't in fact accept er that we should get involved in a ground war in Indo-China .
348685:43	Well there was a lot of people involved on the estate because they had to repair paths .
348686:7	They had to keep the river streams all flowing and if there was any deluge of rain and stones they would have to keep all the pools in good order and they would
348686:69	They had to keep the river streams all flowing and if there was any deluge of rain and stones they would have to keep all the pools in good order and they would
348763:121	And the light room the machine case where the machine for revolving the five the lens which er weighed about five tons and there were this machine revolved the lens and it was machine was solid brass erm just which had to be polished e e every week and er oh beautiful brass polished brass and nobody ever saw these things you know except maybe the commissioners when they came round no no visitors there .
348792:50	So then er er one morning the there was a very heavy swell on and the anchor must have given way and it w we saw the mine floating away towards Tiree so where it went after that we never heard .
348832:87	If there was a swell on the east side where the the grating but there was also a gully landing which you get into the gully but it had to be a very fine day to get into the gully and there was a derrick there er you could a crane there that you could take everything out of the boat but it had to be a very fine day to get into the gully .
348832:191	If there was a swell on the east side where the the grating but there was also a gully landing which you get into the gully but it had to be a very fine day to get into the gully and there was a derrick there er you could a crane there that you could take everything out of the boat but it had to be a very fine day to get into the gully .
348837:37	But we if we used a tin of bully beef we had to supply that tin of bully beef out of our own seven and six pence .
348838:45	We used the flour because the flour would go bad then we we had to supply that the commissioners put it in originally but we had to keep it going out of our seven and a tanner .
348838:83	We used the flour because the flour would go bad then we we had to supply that the commissioners put it in originally but we had to keep it going out of our seven and a tanner .
348912:24	And er there were well they had to get water up from the from the bottom t ladder in pails and three men er with pails trying to and of course they could n't fight it .
348913:33	And they fought the fire until they were finally er had to go out of the tower altogether .
348996:43	Some of them not as high as the non- metals but most of have got to get to a few hundred degrees C before they start .
349124:10	Does n't have to be current but it usually is .
349372:42	Well erm we had books like these , topics that we had to cover .
349550:28	Erm they give it er you just have to know what power is .
349651:19	But the question is you have to design the experiment and you have to be the expert .
349651:42	But the question is you have to design the experiment and you have to be the expert .
349863:38	And of course made it part of the job that you had to attend night school classes for bread baking and confectionery .
349867:9	But you had to pay it initially ?
349894:65	Now in in the bakery at that time it was one of the most progressive bakeries in the city and it must have employed at least about a hundred bakers .
349898:9	But I must say through help of the national agreement and that takes us back to nineteen forty seven .
349903:7	It must have took about three years any way .
349911:104	But however you you wangled them some way and you you eventually learnt your trade by half going to classes at night school and half of information from the bakers you had to put two and two together and you worked it out .
349924:64	But er this is how they they wanted the work done and it was n't a question of one man had to learn the lot you just had to do work away where you were sent to work .
349924:87	But er this is how they they wanted the work done and it was n't a question of one man had to learn the lot you just had to do work away where you were sent to work .
349946:67	Could you give me an example of how you went about making a a bread scone or a roll or what had to be done ?
349960:9	Then it had to be loaded up what they call long thin boards .
349972:22	Well in these days your your sponges had to be set in the afternoon for the men coming in in the morning .
350022:9	So they had to get a chap that knew his business and I think he was entitled to get extra money .
350064:23	Now during the war when we had to have all the windows sealed and blacked out that place became very warm and very uncomfortable to work in .
350068:24	And as as I say they had to put all the mens name in the hat and pick them out and put up a roster and they had their turn of going down the bread week by week .
350086:87	So I think bringing out the national agreement , although it was a great development for the union , and these docked a lot of the work they had to beforehand had to do , it certainly did n't help the relations and the entries in the trade union movement .
350086:97	So I think bringing out the national agreement , although it was a great development for the union , and these docked a lot of the work they had to beforehand had to do , it certainly did n't help the relations and the entries in the trade union movement .
350111:15	Which meant you had to try the mixing drop it onto the plate count how many you got out it clean out the machine and try another one and do the same again and the same again .
350142:18	Er and usually we maybe had to give them a holiday .
350153:24	But unfortunately the parting of the ways had to come and I worked in another wee shop er down in Albert Street in Leith .
350214:11	Although it had to come to the before it was accepted .
350238:64	Now to take you back to when you were on the committee representing what kind of complaints did you have to get there ?
350239:30	Well one of the commonest complaints that we had to deal with was er when your time was up at twelve o' clock you they usually kept you working until about five or ten past twelve .
350241:15	Then of course you had to take that up to the office and report it to the the branch secretary who would come down and deal with it with the management .
350308:12	Well I 've had to stop my classes
350424:10	You 'll have to come up sometime
350569:95	I did n't want to put the new stuff on top of the old until er knew whether we 'd finished or not , yes I think I 'll have to open it
350577:32	Erm , nearly twelve years I think now , no must , must be more than that
350577:37	Erm , nearly twelve years I think now , no must , must be more than that
350578:9	ah , have to get a pair of scissors
350734:9	nin , must been ninety , nineteen fifty I think , yes , we had eight years before our first
350786:13	Sorry I 'll have to put you where the teapot is
350803:25	Erm well in the early days we had to take a kiddies bible school
350882:7	That must of been some time ago
350893:38	and they were saying that er , South Africa 's going to have to import food this year
351113:85	But it 's also erm about discovering the completeness of the ministry of the people of God as we enter through the various commitments that we have to our sister churches in Wales and in Britain and in the world , whether it 's routine or a particular relationship of members or All that 's part of the context of the ways in which we 're talking about and sharing with each other with God .
351132:23	But having sa said that I have to share with you the a key element er , in the life of the church has been the ordained Ministry of Word and Sacrament and pastoral care .
351159:79	And have that sprung on me I I I , I I feel terrible because the communion service i is , is something I have to prepare for in myself and obviously shape the whole se se service around it .
351314:42	We listened and learned that if the church is to grow it must consider all its resources !
351316:7	We must tap that wealth with talent .
351436:34	She was left to bring up a family she had to go the banks for money the banks were all and they refused her money to keep the farm going .
351549:29	Yes well erm we 're still going to have to talk about it with the elders you see .
351551:20	We 're still going to have to talk about with the e , with the
351623:9	And I must say between us at the moment there was n't a strong feeling what it 's all about .
351707:15	the church meeting will have to !
351712:4	must admit .
351806:52	And for those reasons and for the fact that I , more or less enjoyed the journey and had to come anyway as a chauffeur !
351850:61	As a result of that , and I think to make sure this is something we would have to ask the advisory committee but I would read it that that includes mutual recognition of eldership .
351883:50	Having cre , credit by David ' s withering look I always say you have to be terrified !
351940:24	And you 're quite right er we must regard the World Church as meaning ourselves .
351941:50	We tend to refer to the World Church as something outside our particular constituency and we must n't forget that we must own the World Church .
351941:65	We tend to refer to the World Church as something outside our particular constituency and we must n't forget that we must own the World Church .
351952:94	Now , you 'll see that it has a tendency to go all over the world wherever it is invited but whoever invites the World Council of Churches now must , in fact , be able to cope with a great number of people !
351978:83	It was certainly and opportunity for the churches together to look at the world situation in conversation together and thus , to deepen the faith which have to proclaim at arriving at a common understanding of the situation .
351983:135	But , can I say this that what mattered most to me was the fact that I have been in conversation with so many people and to be able to allow that conversation to affect my faith and a faith that I have to proclaim day by day and Sunday by Sunday from the pulpits of my church .
351997:9	Plane flights had to be diverted so , by the time we got to Canberra we were very conscious of the destructive element of the Gulf in our prayers and in our discussions .
352032:27	The first was that for our generation we must learn how to live with the earth promoting harmony sustainability and diversity and , therefore , creation , spirituality was the keynote of the address .
352033:18	Secondly she said there must be a change from the habit of dualism to , what she described as interconnectialism We must see a relationship between things .
352033:75	Secondly she said there must be a change from the habit of dualism to , what she described as interconnectialism We must see a relationship between things .
352034:105	In many parts of the earth , she said , the organised life in accordance with a sense of dualism body , spirit , man , women , black and white , poor and rich we must try and see them , in Christ coming together .
352048:31	If we belong to the World Church then we must be in with part of this worldwide process and we shall never be ashamed of it .
352089:14	Shoppers creche that must er , registered .
352095:9	The church must make every effort to achieve the highest standards .
352097:29	Now there 's one thing that I have to alert us all to the rest may not have been important , perhaps only to some of the larger churches but groups are advised and churches are advised to make sure that in buildings that are used ah , for many different groups that young children under the age of eight do not come into contact with any casual people who may be using that building .
352105:89	One is the children act one will be something on on on the preparation of food , another will be one affecting the way in which charities have to keep registered accounts er , financial accounts which means that an example erm is responsible for registering the accounts of congregations by law .
352129:156	Now , the other two subjects I 'm really only dealing because the people responsible are , are not here in the flesh this afternoon but Alyd the provincial advocate and I I think of Bill that 's also gone too , er yes he he has , he has had to leave this afternoon .
352187:10	Well I must admit I 'm gonna have to present a finance report which is received by an overture .
352187:26	Well I must admit I 'm gonna have to present a finance report which is received by an overture .
352193:73	And what the difference is that er , we thought that you could have one young person per district and that they only have to pay thirty two pounds each , but I think these are only purely
352194:60	Yes , er , I have them for those who received that incorrect information from me , I must apologise erm young people who are going as delegates as representatives of their district must be treated as adult representatives and they have to pay full price .
352194:108	Yes , er , I have them for those who received that incorrect information from me , I must apologise erm young people who are going as delegates as representatives of their district must be treated as adult representatives and they have to pay full price .
352194:130	Yes , er , I have them for those who received that incorrect information from me , I must apologise erm young people who are going as delegates as representatives of their district must be treated as adult representatives and they have to pay full price .
352196:43	So that means that er , in th the total we do have to pay in some way or another , is four thousand pounds with sixty but we 'll say we 've already got three thousand four hundred , if all the for , forty people go and they pay twenty five pounds each , that 's another thousand , so we 've got a I think I 've got it right , a , we 're only a hundred and sixty short .
352213:185	that both Gethwyn and Russell sorted out er who up on on those extremes that you get in a group that , that maybe feel they re that they really have nothing to , hardly anything to do with us they 've do n't receive ministry and why should that be , and after be asked each year , has to go up ?
352218:21	It means that the other people have to give more that 's why some of the churches , I think they 've found that their er , requests for their er er their er contributions , have gone up enormously !
352225:62	So er , at the moment they 're saying all I can see is that er , we would have to use up the whole of our balance , that 's sixteen thousand and the twenty four thousand arrears .
352240:91	Erm , but if we er are are going to en ensure that ministers can get er , at least twelve a of twelve thousand next year then we have to er erm there has to be further offers from provinces .
352240:109	Erm , but if we er are are going to en ensure that ministers can get er , at least twelve a of twelve thousand next year then we have to er erm there has to be further offers from provinces .
352254:110	But th , the thing is that it looks as though it is going to be a fairly ongoing thing that 's going to it may be well on certainly er a beyond assembly when we have to come to a conclusion , and therefore we ought to know the picture er , of , within reform churches far more clearly in giving more time .
352319:30	Therefore , to pay that commitment again the churches must be asked to give more and ask the treasurer to make a further commitment and the churches must find more again !
352319:87	Therefore , to pay that commitment again the churches must be asked to give more and ask the treasurer to make a further commitment and the churches must find more again !
352337:127	in fact , erm anybody that says a lot of sensible things and says look if people are asked to er , to er increase their giving by nought percent that me , it probably means the church might have to be
352371:27	I ca n't come en , elsewhere we have to support this motion too !
352384:120	And therefore , er our proposal is that we should adopt the figures at the bottom of the page which are actually those which the the er er , Inland Revenue have recognised in ones where you do n't have to er , put in a tax return for . . for .
352529:7	We must have three minutes of relaxation before beginning Synod .
352564:7	you have to say .
352638:24	he has bless my Lord and we must .
352639:8	We must and we may share forever forever he turned to God , our to he .
352682:24	I mean , I mean they must be you know
352960:7	I had to park at The Three Pigeons I could n't get in !
352967:12	So that you have to
353123:4	have to look it up .
353196:14	We 'll just have to set it once but it has n't done it .
353313:38	It 's gonna take as long as I thought cos I have to format it and install it .
353465:32	You know it says book forty , do you have to know which books you want to go into ?
353476:10	You might have to write the whole programme again to do that .
353533:17	So basically all I would have to do is take them with me and I 'd bring them home on the same day .
353545:31	Cos some of these places in town , people have to charge you VAT as well do n't they ?
353682:91	I do n't know whether I 've spoken out of place because I 'm not a member of Salisbury park but on the assumption that erm that we would have to share in the
353778:12	But we 've had to bear with it .
353779:18	Too cold but we 've had to bear with it .
353809:63	I would think that 's out because it would destroy the value of the house er that , that has got to be sold some time .
353928:7	Oh must have done .
353935:9	And he must have gone to those churches for the first time .
353974:7	You must know the feeling of this meeting first must n't you ?
353974:31	You must know the feeling of this meeting first must n't you ?
354037:15	Cos I 'll have to confess to you , I saw him diligently once looking below the pulpit
354043:18	Alright he knew he had to go to afterwards , half past three , but he could n't unwind one bit there .
354044:45	And there are occasions , I think we all agree , alright we have to have notes , but you must unwind a little bit to get near to the people .
354044:66	And there are occasions , I think we all agree , alright we have to have notes , but you must unwind a little bit to get near to the people .
354055:12	We have n't had to make a demand upon our congregation to make such a decision for twenty two or twenty five years you see ?
354057:14	Whereas you 've had to do that at Salisbury Park you see ?
354119:12	Yeah but you must , that , that , that your congregation , that all the people in the pastorate must know that they can go to you and that you will listen .
354119:57	Yeah but you must , that , that , that your congregation , that all the people in the pastorate must know that they can go to you and that you will listen .
354175:10	We just had to stop half way .
354192:146	I do n't know , they 've sold out a dozen at Broadway this week , well int last fortnight , so White Gates were telling me , so , well if we do , we do , if the bungalow goes before we sell well , we 'll have to come and live with me mum until we find another one .
354199:15	No , I 'll have to ring our Carl then , see if he can shift it , I mean she might as well be laid down here watching telly as upstairs laid in bed uncomfortable , you know yeah
354212:18	started school when Sasha have to ring him later .
354219:122	No it were Monday when in here cos I was oh I were , Gavin were wanting some toast with jam on and I 'd only got a little bit like that , I says oh you 'll have to wait while your Aunty Margaret brings some more tomorrow .
354282:15	Well I do n't have to do that , that 's the er
354304:7	They must of been mad .
354361:133	This is a painless examination which would take bet er , hang on , this is a painless examination which will take between thirty and sixty minutes , there may be some waiting time at the start of the examination depending on whether we have to fit in an emergency , be prepared for this .
354364:68	If you are it 's , it 's a chest scan , you 'd better ring and see what they have to say , I know .
354383:152	Hello er , I 'm phoning on behalf of Mrs Ada er she 's got to come in for a scan on the fourth of February , nine o' clock , now we 've only just got back from the hospital today , cos she oh , she had to go today for one , yeah , and we 've just
354412:10	Do n't have to drop me , you 're not me taxi , do n't matter how many times you have to take me , here .
354412:63	Do n't have to drop me , you 're not me taxi , do n't matter how many times you have to take me , here .
354441:21	There 's a draught , it must of come from that window there I think .
354453:9	So they must n't put , you know , their full name or whatever
354475:19	I wonder if Margaret 's had to work she 'd come home Friday dinner , with that sickness and diarrhoea .
354489:53	Oh he goes on at five , he leaves house at five Al , and he must be in at one
354495:16	No , I 'll have to get that bed up , put this across here and that chair beside that window .
354515:86	Or why did Stef kidnap well I , you know I ca n't understand this girl , because she 's been in er , I mean she must of seen him when , when he 's approached her to buy the house
354517:12	so surely she must be able to give him
354527:19	But the thing is she must 've seen him .
354529:61	Yeah , but I mean even , even so , she , she has met him once before and she must of seen him when she 's gone to the house for him to kidnap her .
354530:10	Yeah he must 've been following her about .
354534:10	Oh Thomas must be still be Tottenham
354536:10	No they must of took it er , at , his son must of took it because they 've put that girder back in .
354536:37	No they must of took it er , at , his son must of took it because they 've put that girder back in .
354539:30	Yeah they took key with ' em our Thomas must of .
354545:10	I 'll have to tell him when he comes .
354752:114	And that she she looked shocked , you know , she did n't did n't know me like , and er , well she was shocked , and then I said I said , right well we 'll have to get together and sort something out about stopping with her , and Pete said straight away .
354959:20	You know , I he must n't pushed me , that man , who that keeps asking me out .
355030:31	Er , you know when they said we had to pay two hundred and fifty one for er , administration and search and survey .
355132:77	But if you borrow it from a in er mortgage company , you 're gonna , you 're gonna borrow twice that , you gonna have to pay twice that much back .
355151:55	Yeah , because he was in , paper , waste paper , and the fire insurance on that must have been colossal .
355194:7	I must have sensitive eyes
355316:79	I think it 's covered for like , like you say , like for some reason , say you had a fire , and you had to stop work .
355415:66	They make me laugh , when they sit in ' ouse with blanket round them , so they do n't have to turn ' eating up .
355465:28	I said , well , I , there must be summat there , out there , she said no , he said , she said it goes back a long time .
355483:30	Every time we have any spare money , it has to go on pigging coal .
355493:30	Every time we have any spare money , it has to go on pigging coal .
355553:72	Anyway he says he 'd pay him the same money as what he 's on there , ' cos he 'd have to really , would n't just say , say
355558:12	Well , it have to come out of capital , at first .
355569:105	Well , Colin 's gotta be able to do a lot of office work , he 's gonna be out doing quotes , you know what I mean , so he 's going have to have somebody there .
355610:50	The same as , I , them that buys our ' ouse , they 'll have to pay whatever it cost for ' em to value our ' ouse , see if it 's worth lending money , we 'll have the same thing with er bungalow , down there .
355624:47	They sent they sent ' em out from er , Abbey National and we had to pay , well we did pay ' im fifty pound , people that put the building on paid .
355744:15	Well , you 'll have to wait while
355766:7	It must be the summer what does it .
355791:7	You have to lose a race now and again .
355869:34	We 'll he had his money he wo n't have to touch , he could live on that hundred and twenty pound a week .
355884:76	and she said something about , oh we 've been to that new pub , she said , mind , she said , we had to come home at half past nine , she said , he 'd had enough , she said , he were ready for bed , God , she said he 's turning into a right old man , and you know what I mean , she did n't , she would n't ,
355913:41	And that , I 'm changing that way , but , if our kids have to be home with the , a group , when I went to see Squeeze .
355977:7	it must be costing them a fortune , when every time they move , they alter ' ouse , they decorate and put new carpets down and furniture
355978:17	My God , we 'll have to
355991:15	Oh no , she must be older because er , Vicky 's twenty she must be about eighteen .

356013:28	I 'm forty-eight this year , me mum must have been in there nearly fifty year .
356055:8	it must have been about four or five o' clock in morning , and now we never hear any traffic .
356084:18	Well , we do n't have to have a problem , do we ?
356155:21	I mean , you only have to look at top of that cupboard , and it were do n't yesterday .

356582:48	Well I thought there must be something , because I thought oh , she must have had to go in early with her not coming in .
356582:54	Well I thought there must be something , because I thought oh , she must have had to go in early with her not coming in .
356732:17	Then I 'll , probably have to end up and wash up .

366256:49	And when I came back , Bobby I gave Grant they and erm he must 've been pretty desperate because he did a wee wee before we left and he did a wee wee before
366275:10	I 'll have to try and get number one as well .
366351:10	She 'll have to read these books
366367:12	You , you have to stay there so you , it , it 's actually a disk
366448:10	We 'll have to ask Mrs if she 'll go and see the main
366629:7	You must miss him terribly , Bobby ?
366644:15	Besides , I 'll have to oh that er garden party I was telling you about
366655:12	So , just have to wait and see whether we get an invitation or not .
366660:17	I told him it must 've been about the Royal Garden Party .
366724:7	You must n't put on Oliver 's lead .
366832:9	I had to phone Mrs erm , erm Reverend ' s wife and she said , she said I could n't tell you , Mrs but she said erm phone Mrs .
366833:41	So I phoned Mrs I eventually got through to her then I had to phone the prison to tell daddy because he was going to go in and erm I mean I , and then I go back to work , Grant .
366850:159	She said well , tell Grant , she said he can have a reprieve , she said it 's May the eighth and , and she says , she probably heard me say it was Friday and that 's when I thought it was this Friday , so I had to phone erm the receptionist at daddy 's works , so she was going to pass on the message to daddy just to tell him just to work late as usual , Grant , rather than come in at teatime and then go back to work again .
366863:11	Cos the car had to get fixed up .
367027:7	They must rent the other one so that 's what he 's complaining about the charges .
367049:9	So you have to go through them .

367550:9	Oh , must record that .
367810:11	You 'd have to be really lucky would n't you ?
367927:13	Yeah it 'll have to be count .
367975:19	and , and you , you have to say another word that sounds like it .
367984:7	You has to come down .
368048:17	Would n't say he had to buy a pair , track bike , he 's make their own up .
368141:13	He 's always had to keep that bloody thing .
368153:8	I must say , is the heavy way .
368247:19	working out a modules you have to find the
368293:72	, well we have got complex numbers , but we ca n't have B itself in the complex number , right , so B square must be nine , so either B is plus three or B is minus three , one or the two
368331:7	That must be two foot he must mean .
368331:24	That must be two foot he must mean .
368366:10	You 'll have to come with me Chris .
368430:17	But they say you must leave it running for two days .
368640:28	It 's per foot then so you 'd have to what do you want ?
368656:10	I 'd have to go to that one would n't I ?
368657:13	Yeah you 'd have to have the
368699:12	No I 'll have to go to Great Mills then .
368715:21	That 's two you 'd have to have more of that .
368848:13	Though I shall have to keep it on in the summer to keep er
368877:42	And I want it like yours but like you said I 'd have to buy erm Artex and get Chris to do it .
368915:7	we had to plaster it underneath because erm he had to , we just had wires like this down the end ?
368915:36	we had to plaster it underneath because erm he had to , we just had wires like this down the end ?
368919:9	So Steve had to chisel all the wall out .
369017:10	You 'll have to give it a
369021:28	And I said to her well I 'll have to go on a eating binge .
369083:19	And somebody , this other boy had to do his own work .
369133:9	All you have to do is ta ra earn top commission .
369142:7	This must be it then .
369222:46	Once you 've recommended someone do they only send me , I do n't have to order it do I ?
369226:12	Yeah , you have to start it .
369286:32	You do n't want people you 're gonna have to keep
369310:7	I have to buy
369321:12	But mine I have to use bleach in it .
369340:10	I 'll have to use I 've got Surf and I 've got bleach and that 'll do them .
369374:28	that 's all , but then I 'd have to keep blow drying and it every day .
369589:7	I had to think what 's her name ?
369647:7	She must have stretched them .
369656:7	She must of Ange cos they were slopping .
369698:12	heavy so it must be a big one .
369725:13	Oh I 'll have to get her a box of chocolates .
369843:13	Otherwise I 'd have to cancel altogether .
370212:7	He had to grab the wheel twice I think he smashed two cars coming down the road .
370355:9	So it must be Wendy or something .
370417:17	All down there and I had to get a it was that much I had to get a bucket of water , soapy water to scrub it down .
370417:48	All down there and I had to get a it was that much I had to get a bucket of water , soapy water to scrub it down .
370443:12	It do n't have to be wound wet does it ?
370476:10	Well they must have done .
370477:7	They must have done .
370573:25	She does stare quite a bit I must admit .
370585:12	Well you 'll have to go in the office .
370704:13	We 'll just have to put it down there some time and just put it on .
370708:7	Just have to try and , take a little while to get used to it .
370781:7	You have to realize that we 're never gonna get away from work .
370791:61	handy to live on the on your right next to work in a way cos you do n't have to worry about
370806:37	I said if you go for a drink you do n't have to worry about getting home .
370808:50	Yeah I know we 'd still go up the Clickers sometimes but we do n't have to go all the time do we ?
370833:15	Think we 'll have to put down yes though when we talk to mum .
370837:7	You have to put the the regional accents acc accent if they have one .
370997:12	if you had to go and try a garment on , you deliberately did n't wear underwear or
371057:75	If my children came home and said to me that they got the cane at school I 'd have just said well you must have deserved it .
371059:18	I said well he must have done something to deserve it .
371087:54	Oh I was playing up and they chucked me out the class or something and I had to stay in at dinner time .
371139:18	But next time I shall have to run , take the cash in there .
371162:8	I must do them now and then it 's out of the way cos you and I want to see Emmerdale at seven .
371170:48	And then when we finished er finished the game about , I do n't know must have been about twenty to eleven when we finished the game there was sandwiches and chips coming out .
371309:7	she must weight fourteen , fifteen stone I should think .
371312:7	I must admit .
371387:21	He 's been reckon she must have locked herself up in the dark .
371403:25	and this that and the other but people must have heard what went on and and you know the next morning they 'd see a black eye and just carry out a normal conversation as though
371407:26	Then you know I mean they must have what was going on oh aye they just completely ignore it .
371424:21	is the bathroom , so she must have been in there cos he 's hammering on the door and bashing it and kicking it .
371440:22	Sally ca n't drive so it must be some
371584:32	if a lot of others were off we 'd have to cope somehow would n't we ?
371587:35	And possibly Tina and that is off so they 'll just have to struggle on as if we were there and a lot of others were off .
371608:12	But I 'll have to go into town first .
371705:14	Oh we 'd have to go and have a look in the light .
371732:12	He do n't have to keep calling and wandering around after us .
371735:87	As you say three thousand pound a year that could be paid off a place of our own is is just I mean if I have to rent it well I 'll have to rent one .
371735:108	As you say three thousand pound a year that could be paid off a place of our own is is just I mean if I have to rent it well I 'll have to rent one .
371831:43	People are desperate to buy and they 'll have whatever and they have to pay .
371855:101	That 's why it 's best to go through an agency or er something like White and Eddies because they have people that collect them and they have people who have to take up references and
371886:35	Otherwise probably that 's why they are dear because they have to do things like that .
371977:10	They 'll have to pay another mortgage as well .
371979:10	Well she must have paid a bit off .
371988:32	Well I do n't know , I mean Steve must pay about eighty pounds a bloody week .
372072:10	Thought somebody must have kicked him out of bed this morning .
372094:34	well I would n't be absolutely if , if I had to go out then I 'd have to go out .
372094:55	well I would n't be absolutely if , if I had to go out then I 'd have to go out .
372164:7	Just have to ask .
372329:13	Well you 'd have to have it sticking out round .
372336:21	I 'm afraid it would have to be sticking out .
372663:21	Never mind we 'll just have to stay here the night .
372766:10	you 'd have to negotiate on that one with Mr and Mr .
372789:26	That 's what he said he had to
372865:55	As I say I mean well because I do feel the cold I suppose I have to have more heat than
372942:7	I must admit I like a shower but then again I do like the chance to have a bath now and again
372956:15	I mean I must admit I 've looked at some other flats .
372959:20	And so I mean you had to sort of go up several flights of stairs and you walked in and it , it looked lovely .
372974:44	You 'd got the toilet there and behind the door , I mean you had to sort of squeeze yourself and shut the door , and behind the door was a shower .
373019:21	So how much notice do you have to give ?
373044:40	Yeah I mean that 's the same as I di I must admit I did have sort of an argument with him once over his music .
373132:12	You do n't have to have
373183:12	We did n't have to come .
373198:18	Well th er you have to wait till you hear from them really before you do can you ?
373606:12	You do n't have to come too early only I 've got to go at quarter to seven .
373730:12	Then you 'll have to be careful
373789:7	I must n't forget my keys .
373972:15	And would you still have to have an insurance on top of that ?
373973:7	You have to have term assurance .
373974:15	So you 'd still have to have
373985:9	And he must have known that they 're gonna be cheaper so why does n't he advise people who are starting out to take one of them ?
374006:118	You see the thing is you see I mean wh wh when this law came out , LAUTRO and all that business came out that , and best advice and all this sort of thing you had to go through all the finances and what people earned and all that sort of thing .
374166:98	No well that 's what he said , it does n't but I mean he went through all these and insurance companies and because of my kidney being removed I had to pay , I had to pay higher even though I did n't have to have a bloody medical but I had to pay high because of my
374166:113	No well that 's what he said , it does n't but I mean he went through all these and insurance companies and because of my kidney being removed I had to pay , I had to pay higher even though I did n't have to have a bloody medical but I had to pay high because of my

427261:10	You might have to do it later .
427312:141	You 've got , you 've got like water rate , twelve hundred , er , rates , twelve but er , what we could try to do is approach them and see if we can lump it in with this year and that , obviously have to pay higher
427337:138	if we can resolve it with cos then you 're getting summat on a different style of thinking to that , you know , I know Fred does n't wanna be involved but then you 've always got somebody , well we 'll have to go and see Fred first .

427811:29	I mean I I think you just have to but
427813:10	You 'd have to play it by ear I think .
427836:39	Yeah , I mean , what you , what you 'd have to be careful of is , is sooner or later people 'll catch on to
428081:7	You must be one of the few people
428133:105	I mean , it 's unbelievable , you know th er , he 's done so many breweries and yet why they do n't talk to wo well I mean they must talk to one another .
428141:9	or someone has to take a , a bi a co company has to take a big lot off .
428141:41	or someone has to take a , a bi a co company has to take a big lot off .

429135:10	we 'll have to take it off this .
429178:8	They must be all done or they would n't be down in the first place would they ?
429210:12	We 're gonna have to walk some of this down are n't we ?
429349:19	I think we 'll have to , I think we 've got to keep it cos I think it 's part of the fixtures and fittings unfortunately .
429354:63	We well what I think I 'm gonna do is next Thur not this Thursday , we 'll just have to live through this Thursday , but next Thursday , erm I 'm gonna get get Stella back on , and I 'm just gonna sell it as cost , whatever it is , sixty P a pint or whatever .

430245:16	It must , it must have been absolute arm and a leg .
430283:14	So you would n't have to spend a fortune on , on , on I mean it 's only a matter of most of it 's a matter of paint , and then hanging a few things up is n't it ?
430605:25	Right down , and how , do you have to go outside to get to it ?
430637:12	Cos you 'll have to keep your beer down there wo n't you ?
430681:31	It 's just happened to er you 're gonna have to get some what they call it ?
430761:24	Oh so you could n't you 'd have to leave them

431144:111	for the sake of , for the sake of a few bands that we do , I mean most of the bands on the local level are used to playing in pubs so they just had to play on the floor anyway and the rest of it
431176:78	But once he 's , once he 's resigned himself to that , he 's then gotta look at that operation next door and he must be losing money hand over fist for the amount of space it is .

443399:24	Yeah , but then do n't they have to get permission ?
443459:49	from Liverpool Street I wanted to get to Oxford Circus which meant that I had to change at , I forget where now , because I 'm in such a , a muddle now after all this ,
443460:37	where ever it was , whatever it was I had to do , I got stuck , there were , there were just no underground trains in either direction on that line at all and a , a great tanner went
443496:15	How many did you have to do for that test then ?
443558:57	do n't know , no I wo n't ask you that cos I ca n't remember what I have to ask the teacher 's , , erm .
443603:28	In the next house you see I shall have to have different seating , they , they , I 'm going to , I 'm going to get somewhere smaller , so that three piece suite , it owes me nothing it only cost me what seven hundred pounds
443642:63	we have , you 've got to make a model , yeah and that 's mine , you have to get two men and two children across the river , you 've got one and they ca n't swim , this is my one , two boys go across , one boy comes back , one man goes across , the other boy comes back , two boys go across , one boy comes back , one man goes across the other boy comes back two boys go across , I need to show that on , on .
443666:105	This stupid Lee at the moment for his exam , he 's meant to have done it by Christmas and he has n't done it for C D T , and he , they had to just choose something erm to make that actually sort of works , so Lee could n't , I mean they did crane 's and things like that and he could n't , the thing he came up with and he 's teacher was a , a go erm , what was it Dave , a goalie stand in his goal
443737:87	He wanted to stay in his own place but Jackie and Neville were nearly driven mad running up and down to Letchworth when all that they had to do , Jackie 's full time teaching and Nev is trying to build as many kitchens or build as many doors for millionaires as he possibly can .
443749:76	I said look Neil you can drive , but let 's not let 's not take it that I 'm saying that you must drive let 's go into the question of why you 're making a mess of it at this time and we , oh honestly Brenda if I 've got black circles under my eyes do not be surprised because , of course , this all goes back to his absolutely , appallingly , stupid mother !
443755:27	all mothers are sacred but I just had to put the boot in on her , I 'm afraid , I said stuff !
443767:23	and and he says too he had to admit that he 's lazy .
443809:28	But er that 's from now on Neil has got to carry th the responsibility for his own actions .
443882:130	just for fun , you know but I 'm not a believer in using your fists , you ought to be using your brain to teach with but there were no there are no sanctions , if you say you must stay behind after school , you have to send a letter home and half the parents will write back and say my son or daughter is not staying after school and that is that !
443882:152	just for fun , you know but I 'm not a believer in using your fists , you ought to be using your brain to teach with but there were no there are no sanctions , if you say you must stay behind after school , you have to send a letter home and half the parents will write back and say my son or daughter is not staying after school and that is that !
443910:101	And he said no and I said okay , fair enough but then , you know you can say to Lee , well if you want something now you 're gonna have to work
443934:52	and have a decent life to get a first or either a two one in economics you have got to read a very great deal , you 've got to be a reader , a student a taker of notes , a writer of essays and we said that is not you so within two
443992:124	well we ca n't go into the reasons for that but I said let 's respect the reasons I said if that 's how you feel I said , you 're a man you you must make your own decisions I said probably in a few months time you 'll come
444047:110	If you get a a pension based on the fact that you 're your late husband 's widow when you are no longer your late husband 's widow , but somebody 's wife they do n't have to pay you that pension .
444060:12	Oh oh you must !
444221:28	Erm if I 'm sixty five she must be sixty seven two years .
444268:118	Oh my dear some of them are comparing you with Racquel Welsh or whatever , you know you get the impression they 're looking down their nose , as much to say oh how dreadful for me to have to be seen with this old person !
444357:20	Re remind me tomorrow I must take those twenty vouchers
444375:175	and they would actually send and I know why because erm John Lewis in London erm Jackie wanted some fabric and she 'd seen it up there and Harrods and erm she found out she did n't have her card with her , just her Barclaycard said would you post this we wou we 'll have to charge you , like , two pound
444401:10	and he has to get , like Woking to Surbiton Surbiton to Clapham Junction
444422:36	sort of , quarter past seven he 's had to leave in the morning to get there and then not getting home to , sort of , seven o' clock Dave picks up from the station and I think
444489:109	No , no I ca n't I just ca n't eat so I 'm not forcing myself to eat , what I 'm trying to do is only to eat the right things and I must start vitamin supplements I think I 've got the age when I probably need that , I mean , this cold is a warning to me that my immune system is not as strong as it ought to be , I should n't have had another cold so soon after getting rid of one !
444511:54	I think I 'm not she will then come in and let herself in , I have to be in at three
444572:123	He said I could never replace her he said e nobody is to she is he said I just could n't , he said I 'd you know , I 'd pay what I 'd have to
444624:67	and your instrument panel started showing that the wheels had fallen off and one wheel was on fire first thing we had to think was are the reading correct !
444629:45	And you had get the two people who were at the back , you have to get them out before you landed because when you when you brought the flaps up if they were still in this little bay you would squash them to death and one day his dials showed that he had , in fact , squashed them to death !
444679:65	Yeah , if I sell at a time when there 's still a recession on and you see somebody has to get my they had a visit perhaps that was somebody that actually bought a house , not she not
444766:32	took it in and they said well they have to send it away and Dave said , yeah okay , he said well it 's forty nine pound before you start
444820:208	Yes well it 's possible that er Alan may see a way to using that but he is quite ni , I mean he he 's got no doubts he wants to come to me he 's in a divorce at the moment and the moment that the final papers are signed , he 's got to get out of the house he has to stay there till the last minute and then the moment that the papers are signed , he must go .
444820:261	Yes well it 's possible that er Alan may see a way to using that but he is quite ni , I mean he he 's got no doubts he wants to come to me he 's in a divorce at the moment and the moment that the final papers are signed , he 's got to get out of the house he has to stay there till the last minute and then the moment that the papers are signed , he must go .
444843:9	And he has to week before he gets any money he has to work a week in arrears , you know , they they
444843:40	And he has to week before he gets any money he has to work a week in arrears , you know , they they
444854:8	He must n't ! .
444873:39	Cos I thought that was a with a utmost difficulty and he has to get his little daughter on Sunday to help him to clean the place .
444880:122	But if you 'd said oh well I 'll prepare , what about if I prepare you , oh yes well I 'll have that probably if you 'd got done it he 'd have it because he had to help himself .
444893:28	winter and then , you know , you have to sort of use a plate to
444941:103	For someone like Nigel who 's got all the tools it it 'd be a a it 's not a job you can come in and just do it cos you have to take a bit off clean it
444956:10	Well it must have had a split in or something .
444965:34	We did n't , we have n't cos Les has to go through the books and charge
445033:15	So what did Jim have to say much ?
445076:23	All it is , he had to help , there were fifteen and seventeen year olds , were n't they ?
445097:16	Mm you 'll have to be careful cos that could affect the heating too , wo n't it ?
445417:42	and er anyway he got home about half past three so we had to go down to Marks went down to Marks , came back and he bought me a sandwich , I said I 've eaten nothing all day , bought me this sandwich , I was hoping to go away at six
445476:57	this is the story of my life now in the bathroom I have had , I have had to pay a hundred pounds to Mr Butcher the plumber to put in a new shower thing because that was cheap and rough and eventually wore out should never have been put in .
445484:12	all that has had to be replaced because that was starting to drip down into the hall , again !
445485:11	And then I had to th the shower just came , you know came to pieces in our hand , as it were it was not working as a shower so a plumber had to come Mr Butcher came into me
445485:104	And then I had to th the shower just came , you know came to pieces in our hand , as it were it was not working as a shower so a plumber had to come Mr Butcher came into me
445490:53	And the next thing that 's going wrong in the bathroom will be that I 'll have to replace that central heating pump .
445531:177	I hate to think how much money I have paid over to Anglia Gas if I 'd known what I was into I could have walked into that house then and I could , while I had all that money before I gave any away I could have said , right , I 'm going to have to spend that , that , that , that and that and I would have done it and it would have I would 've been alright because I would n't have had things going wrong !
445553:24	Because another way in which I had to throw good money after bad was that after he died once I started having things done in the house they kept on turning up things that he had done that were absolutely N B G
445625:12	Well yes I had to spend quite a lot of time on the line to her because er her husband 's been quite ill with bladder trouble .
445712:10	they 'd have to put
445716:9	No they must have had a cylinder there already .
445748:28	You do n't we were u we had to use the immersion did n't we cos w we moved in in the June and Lofty and Brian said well do n't have it done cos you 're not gonna use until August so we they did it August time for us so but we did n't use Servowarm cos it had blown up , they just disconnected it for us , so we used the ho the immersion heater
445773:10	Oh I must s sort your your watch
445863:17	Every three weeks she has to ?
445869:15	How often does he have to change the suits you know , how long do they last ?
445870:15	I mu I must ask her how how long they do .
445871:11	Because they must , I mean even though Mark 's are good suits , I mean they must get a lot of wear .
445871:57	Because they must , I mean even though Mark 's are good suits , I mean they must get a lot of wear .
445873:7	He must get
445875:9	He must have to have about half a dozen though , must n't he ?
445875:12	He must have to have about half a dozen though , must n't he ?
445875:35	He must have to have about half a dozen though , must n't he ?
445882:14	Not sure , I must ask her where he does he goes to a Marks where they always have every possible man 's suit that Marks make and and he takes the time to buy two or even three because he does n't get that much time for shopping .
446069:9	Do I have to take that ?
446075:15	Yes you do n't have to paint it .
446089:12	I do n't have to do it .
446161:47	what he can say that he 'd go with her but he 'd had to be back , sort of , by four cos he 's going out with you he says that , that 'll get him out of it then wo n't he ?
446193:13	I might actually have to take some Gaviscon tonight .
446232:25	Oh between the lot of us we must have some intellect .
446247:23	but you know , you do n't have to do it .
446274:18	You said you had to model it but make it , squeeze it in the middle so it 's fatter at the ends that 's it , so it looks like a canoe
446756:28	Cat er one of the cat 's fleas must have bitten me last night .
446941:12	But you 'll have to get your moonboots and things like that .
446942:10	You 'll have to buy them for your skiing trip .
446991:38	Yeah well if we do n't get it tomorrow we 'll have to go one night , it 's late night shopping till nine o' clock .
447033:10	We 've had to sponge off him all week .
447038:28	Mind you he went out and he had to have er erm mind you he 's had that , when you think of it you 've had half of that back .
447047:9	And we had to pay fifteen quid for the train ticket .
447150:8	I must say , it does look gigantic .
447395:7	Might have to rewrite it .
447507:65	Well I have in the past given them fifty each for Christmas but this year they 're going to have to make do with twenty .
448132:32	Well I think that probably Neil 's clothes will have to go back in a Marks and Spencers
448340:13	Even if you had to after Christmas take it back they wo n't know .
448509:15	But I shall still have to draw on some capital Brenda , nevertheless .
448511:15	I mean you have to Christmas time though do n't you ?
448622:7	I must .
448624:12	No and we must .
448635:31	I was deter , you see I , I have to set a good example to Neil .
448684:19	Well I think there must , this must be a very common feeling for a lot of people that they feel that they 're balanced on a knife edge .
448684:27	Well I think there must , this must be a very common feeling for a lot of people that they feel that they 're balanced on a knife edge .
448685:22	There 's so much we 've had to pay out so much erm you 've had to pay out so much on , on more mortgage than you expected .
448685:51	There 's so much we 've had to pay out so much erm you 've had to pay out so much on , on more mortgage than you expected .
448771:64	Erm what you , er what you could manage in the way of repayments what , er er you had to put one third of the full price down .
448774:10	Yeah you had to put one third of the full price .
448775:46	So if a three piece suite cost say a hundred and fifty pounds , you had to put fifty pounds down .
448859:7	She must have a colossal debt .
448880:32	I did n't know that I was going to have to sell my house for twenty five thousand less than all my neighbours were selling at .
449017:31	Where you walk in and think oh these must be council houses as you 're driving through .
449052:7	I have to Brenda .
449076:19	And they said no they had to write it off .
449146:60	Yes er somehow they , they 'd , they 'd got it , or was it or did I have to fill in a a census form just at the time when Paul was with me ?
449153:75	Well that 's what they say if there 's , even people that come over here for a holiday for three months have to pay it do n't they ?
449157:9	Did Neil have to pay it ?
449166:23	He was paying it and I must make sure that he is paying it .
449168:35	Oh yes if it , it will be moi who has to foot the bill .
449203:30	No question of a divorce and marriage , she just had to get on with it .
449351:51	Now I do n't know what they were worth and she was saying they must have been worth quite a bit cos they 're big detached solid houses are n't they ?
449389:11	I I must say Brenda , all this knocks years off my age .
449489:23	No I er we , we 'll have to start by asking as you say .
449506:29	Brekkypoos still got ten more I 'll have to be careful this does n't oh it 's hot in here Jean is n't it ?
449584:9	But I must say the carpet looks better in the sitting room since
449804:10	No I must n't , I must n't buy any anyway .
449804:20	No I must n't , I must n't buy any anyway .
449835:10	You 'll have to keep talking Carla .
449848:36	which balloon has the mouse let go off and you have to follow them .
450106:10	Well they have to have lots of pretends cos there 's so many children .
450129:7	It must have been a lovely sight .
450214:15	in my book we have to make a bit like that look .
450216:7	You have to put large there and little there .
450369:24	And er she said , and he must of noticed me .
450395:17	Cos I mean he must have had thousand kids in that sort of
450423:7	I must give Kim a ring .
450430:12	Erm she had to erm she 's got the social worker in now , involved in it
450702:57	Well it is but I mus n't let it annoy me Brenda because in a way he must know what he 's doing .
450718:39	And she said er Angela said to her oh poor Neil has to stays in bed until one o' clock every Saturday and then on Sunday he has a he gets up late and then he has a long rest in the afternoon and Pam said to me he 's copping out .
450802:48	and all that I mean you know they 're not hav they do n't have to be as committed
450822:10	Mm she must be at this stage .
450956:32	Unless those mind you those lights to change there must be an empty space .
451076:32	Department numbers and how you spend it so you must have to fill this card in I should think The only the only department is the cosmetics that 's not we 'll ask when we get there .
451076:35	Department numbers and how you spend it so you must have to fill this card in I should think The only the only department is the cosmetics that 's not we 'll ask when we get there .
451083:49	I arrived at the station in good time for the train but I did n't have to wait more than three or four minutes and I was in London at ten to eleven .
451113:11	That they have to .
451197:90	But you do n't like to because of the fact you know he 'll be erm sort of lugging it around and you 'd feel you 'd actually have to sort of hurry him up would n't you ?
451322:9	And I must make a real effort to find one of these machines that 's working .
451391:10	I 'll have to go to the loo or something to get some paper I sha n't worry about .
451505:11	If you had to buy a box then the tissue paper then the bow
451515:31	I 've got to get some petrol I have to get at When did you ask me in Guildford B H S now ?
451585:72	I 've had this twice and each time it 's been upheaval because he 's got a lot of goods which had to moved in shoe horned in moved peoples belongings out of one cupboard into another .
451629:19	Oh you had did you have to pay the money ?
451758:7	I must admit this town short of cafe 's for reason .
451765:20	Right , and I , I must get to the Nationwide .

456649:12	Yeah , you have to .
456653:18	And that she 'll just have to take a chance tonight .
456693:75	But it 's just been too wet and too nasty to do anything about it so when we 've got a chance we 'll have to really do .
456699:18	I think I 'll have to put her down again then .
456715:8	and not have to worry that they 're er gonna be a problem for mum

460657:7	You have to make
460670:26	Wait till daddy lights , we 'll all have to sing again !
461122:23	But he 's , he just really has to get in touch with one of them and tell them the prices .
461129:39	If he , if he says anything to me I 'll just have to tell him .
461139:73	And also , it 's cos that , you know after we had that row about Terry , after Bank Holiday expecting not to have to do a day in the shop , and er he 's already owing Brian a day ?
461198:23	That 's not your regulations you have to read is it ?
461244:30	I thought you said , one , you had to have somebody involved who is ? .
461249:46	Well not the organizer surely oh I know I would have thought you 'd have to , shoot it
461254:32	But I would have expected that the whole thing would have to be operated by , somebody who was qualified .
461257:86	If you 're just somebody who 's on the outside providing services , to keep the smooth running of it then you do n't really have to know anything about it .
461259:73	But if you 're actually involved in it , and you want to be involved in the people , then I think you have to know something about it .
461282:10	We 'd have to buy two adjoining .
461294:13	You may even have to count two .
461300:14	But I do n't have to do it every day all day .
461319:26	If we moved in then we 'd have to spend fifty thousand pound to get it up to scratch .
461370:10	You really must think we 're daft .
461373:207	I 've been going to bed at half past one and I was doing the T M A for two nights , then I 've been doing his V A T for two nights so I 've got to bed really really late and I just and , the thing is , the T M A were all on about my then I just start to relax I had to resort to herbal knockout drops .

461507:10	I 'll have to put you down some time .
461512:31	Just a bit left on her legs so the baby must have used up all if the baby carries on like this she 'll be anaemic I think .

467340:7	We must make a cake
467343:13	We do n't have to but I 'd like to want to get rid of some of this flour
467393:12	Well you 'll have to because she ca n't swim yet .
467442:16	To where we must go ?
467443:7	Where must we go ?
467444:7	We must go in the shop in the Pinge to buy something for my bunny .
467445:8	We must go to Penge you mean .
467469:13	Hmm I must go to Croydon must n't I to change that bra .
467469:25	Hmm I must go to Croydon must n't I to change that bra .
467553:15	I think I must do something .
467592:21	It 's even worse You have to climb up steps to get out of that station .
467595:26	Any way it would mean we 'd have to walk from Thornton Heath .
467875:95	But we and there was erm , and there was another one and you 'd got to do about erm some , someone gets kidnapped and erm you have to do it , and they ha some somebody finds out and they erm rescue the
467978:7	You must n't .
468135:10	Yes he must be .
468411:10	Well I have to wear them do n't I ?
468431:33	Got to get you that erm leotard today , I must do that .
468479:18	I think it just has to .
468493:13	You do n't have to walk with me , you know , you can walk twenty yards in front if you want then well I 'll get the car 's right up there , right up top end .
468650:7	They must be further down .
468654:9	And I had to go to Boots and get these batteries the erm what 's it called ?
468655:15	Smoke detector 's batteries must be going down cos it 's making a funny noise .
468708:11	But , they had to do monitor today .
468711:57	I mean he 's alright but he 's rude to the little ones and after you have to take the plates away and scrape all the food off in the bins .
468756:8	You have to pour the custard on , and the they ask for more custard so you pour more custard on and you could just leave it .
468761:30	Now stop here and you 're going to have to cross the road .
468982:10	Well it must have been in the evening cos it was shut .
469002:7	I must remember to tape that er wa Waller Birds is it ?
469047:7	Somebody must have been overtaking .
469122:7	Probably have to do the them drills anyway .
469133:19	Every watch that comes on has to do a drill .
469164:19	I went there , I had to go there this week for work .
469165:36	You know when you go in the car park you have to get a token to get out .
469171:32	Anyway , when I went to go I had to go to the desk give you a token , this token lifts the barrier up .
469189:46	Erm I know you brought it with you Chris , so it must
469222:7	We must get the far better weather .
469262:21	Is it one where you have to keep it with you ?
469267:36	I know there 's one where you used to have to keep it .
469457:28	But I still do n't get what you have to write !
469459:31	No , but I do n't know what I have to , I have to write !
469459:43	No , but I do n't know what I have to , I have to write !
469506:17	Shared by nine is have to work out what it is .
469529:17	It means that I have to do it !
469732:15	Oh well I 'll have to give you another one .
469764:10	I 'll have to have a look at it later .
469840:14	I imagine that must be the reference there .
469869:9	Do you have to put that ?
470103:9	So it must be missing it bad then ?
470164:45	I think he is off of it now but I think he must be quite a leading light
470183:10	You 'll have to warn her about it .
470221:7	I must say I do n't think twice now about opening that window whereas before I only did it reluctantly because of all the dust .
470250:20	I do n't think you have to take it back , I did n't take that chicken back to Safeway 's if you remember .
470264:25	And then went and bought another fresh chicken had to pay even more money for it .
470304:9	No they have to be in by the twenty sixth of June .
470374:7	I must say I like it .
470539:7	I must say I wondered .
470585:103	Well that , it speak the truth they were given to me by June , who 's very into that sort of thing and prescribed them for Simon and in fact has had to give him a few more now because he 's had his driving test cancelled .
470615:9	And you have to take three the day before
470616:26	Yes they 're not very strong , you have to build it up gradually .
470671:9	So she has to have her spayed .
470672:46	I did n't know she planned to breed from her but er she must .
470744:13	We will probably have to prove that we have not been paid for the consignment .
470846:24	But they could possibly , they surely must be able to do it through natural wastage to some extent .
470876:61	I mean with something like British Gas erm to make the enormous profit they 've made surely it must be possible to reduce the price to the consumer .
470879:19	Erm I I I must say I have n't read or heard anything about the British Gas thing .
470886:30	But the guy said well ninety percent of this has got to be spent on a small proportion of the works which we are required to do over the next decade .
470914:12	You , you have got to have a waiting list to use the facilities reasonably fully .
470991:12	So presumably you have to do it
471029:30	I think fifty pounds you know before they have to no it is n't my credit limit
471047:10	So that had to go back and I had to find my Visa card much to the annoyance of people queuing behind me .
471047:29	So that had to go back and I had to find my Visa card much to the annoyance of people queuing behind me .
471111:15	Well you do n't have to .
471257:53	I wonder if she 'll change her time because of half term and she wo n't have to be taking her daughter to nursery school today , half past one .
471264:10	I 'll have to go into that little Auntie Pat 's Textiles or whatever it 's called in the afternoon .
471377:33	No , so , when it 's full you have to put another tape in , does it
471763:21	Erm , so that you would have to allow for those ideal circumstances in maximum temperature .
471797:46	Oh , well I do n't to ask him cos I know he must be his A levels .
471846:7	He must need to know it for other reasons .
471887:16	All that in there must have been that thick .
471925:5	must be advantage of getting ready and being prepared for her and
471946:33	Well we had one or two earlier this week , I must say .
472054:43	Educational is not seen as a vital part of national right , that must be somebody The wages earned by unskilled workers in Germany are twice as high as those earned by teachers here
472067:7	You must have control of your class , sometimes if you do n't , under , when I say he 's a weak teacher I do n't mean he 's a bad teacher .
472195:51	Lynda seems to be staying on a bit , oh no , no , she does have to stay till two sometimes .
472206:29	In Belgium , Netherlands and Luxembourg , drivers will have to use dipped headlights in daylight from nineteen ninety two .
472357:31	If you do n't want that black bit , you have to prune that .
472478:57	Ooh ah The trouble is the figures keep changing , all the rest of it , you have to stay rather more alert than you choose .
472546:12	Then we 'll have to tip someone on the floor .
472907:7	You have to clear up behind the tree bit .
472972:16	E even so she has to pay the first something or other you , as one does in a claim
473033:7	We have to then drive round again to get home .
473039:39	bring a , I knew there was something else I had to bring fabric .
473204:31	Well there 's no point , I , I had to stand there choosing in all that .
473216:21	No , no , look I must ring here , we have a bit on to that behind the tree , you can let that happen .
473241:11	Like they have to take time to establish .
473255:10	Well I must say I much prefer it like that cos it covers up the ugly fence .
473417:46	Yes , the , the lady in question was saying what , she had to have , I think , I think what she was saying was , that for every person over forty five she had to have somebody under forty five .
473417:118	Yes , the , the lady in question was saying what , she had to have , I think , I think what she was saying was , that for every person over forty five she had to have somebody under forty five .
473420:15	What , do you have to stand there when you walk down the street , and when you go to
473429:20	Probably their dad said you must n't go in there too often .
473451:18	I think not liking must come into it partly .
473500:7	You must of done it , for the six , for the within the school , not for the .
473539:38	We 've made some water bridges in a clay which I have to put in the kiln on Monday , .
473703:7	She must be very poor .
473734:30	It seems to me this student bar , does have to make a vast profit .
473739:39	Might be a man in charge , but they probably do n't have to pay lots of wages .
473745:34	Whereas pubs are different , they are out , they have to pay a lot of people and their rent and everything else and they are ours to make a profit .
473764:13	What do you have to say to that ?
473833:27	liquid , no diffusion can anywhere , does n't have to pass membrane at all .
473858:7	There must be .
474028:24	It 's alright , we do n't have to do anything
474151:42	That 's that , You ca n't freeze that one , I 'll have to make the sandwiches with these because if I freeze the bread
474155:13	Yes , you must n't re-freeze things , so I try to make the sandwiches
474375:33	And I forgot to wash the cats so , I had to .
474412:10	The lavatera has to be put in a sunny spot , I think it 'll have to go
474412:49	The lavatera has to be put in a sunny spot , I think it 'll have to go
474454:19	You 'll , you 'll have to say sit .
474501:40	And then when I get to school , I do , I have to pour all the water into the tank , and leave it for a couple of hours and at break time put the fish into the into the mix water
474616:142	together with a representative of British Rail , and he was saying that , I , forget how many car transporters they 've got that erm , they built , bought specially to go on British Rail , he said , but they said he just had to give them up for many reasons and one of them was the problems that they have with new cars when they take them on British Rail and the brake dust from the trains apparently causes immediate rust .
474712:26	I , I pity the poor typist has to transcribe this as and when if it happens , ha , ha she 's going to get some very strange noises , including me having a pee and flushing the loo before lunch , what have you , I forgot to switch it off .
474771:10	You virtually have to read that and register it .
474824:20	I , I think people must do because the number of them that are sold .
474827:30	Five or ten pounds is the price that has to be paid for them and they last six months and they move on to the next , extraordinary approach .
474831:47	When Stephanie 's mother died we found in the bungalow a watch , it must of been given I would of thought to her father probably for his twenty first and I took it to a jewellers in Elton , well that 's all he does is watches actually apart from jewellery .
474868:56	That 's , that 's true , eh , I mean the alloy in the other ones have to be quite crafty when you get up to twenty two carat for example and eh , very eh , eh , large chunk of gold in it , and it can indeed be very soft , but then you see that 's an eighteen carat ring that I 've had for , worn , all the time for twenty four years
474876:184	I had one repaired for Susannah , it had been left to her by an aunt and she had managed to smash it against a post or something and broke the shank and knocked out one of the erm , stones , so on and so forth , and eh , together with some repairs on a charm bracelet I had to pay thirty seven pounds for the whole jolly lot .
474887:22	and erm , eh , they have must be absolutely horrific , you have to pay for all that sort of thing do n't you ?
474887:40	and erm , eh , they have must be absolutely horrific , you have to pay for all that sort of thing do n't you ?
474898:40	I suspect that more people use it cos you do n't have to pay .
474905:19	There 's something I must do over here is go Govidge Gallery .
474916:12	Yes , it must be .
474989:12	Well I 've had to have it faced with nine on , because in the end , it , even with it gets erm , damaged .
475113:10	Oh you have to got there in a minute .
475159:77	they say to me , yes that 's through , it 's O K , so that 's it you do n't have to
475169:13	then you would have to accept it , cos it 's really the person who 's in play who 's the referee .
475299:16	The other ball contact , must be a contact there .
475302:22	Now that yellow , that blue ball must move
475407:18	Probably somewhere round here , must be .
475512:9	Do n't have to say
475741:45	I think he is off of it now but I think he must be quite a leading light
475814:86	You ca n't for real you ca n't really move blue ball you can move the red ball as much as you like but not What you have to do is to so just try a normally conventional just sling straight through here
475846:7	You must you must get at least a ball a pioneer ball near your next two
475846:14	You must you must get at least a ball a pioneer ball near your next two
476124:7	they must have somewhere where we can play , but erm perhaps I ought to trouble is that you get fobbed off you know .
476211:45	for a period of five or ten years and lease it off them and then have to maintain it .
476222:7	I must admit that I got fed up with pursuing it and I think it 's like banging your head against a brick wall in the end .
476481:10	Yes you have to do that I believe these days too .
476590:10	Oh we have to share a finger bowl .
476607:7	I must tape number ten no it takes an hour and a half on tape number ten .
476632:9	And she had to come in the car while I
476643:18	I think they really must .
476665:9	But he must be quite good unusual to start by playing a whole game ?
476712:36	Did you notice in the front of the back so you must remember to take back .
476794:7	I must finish on the tenth
477184:15	I think he must be because of sounds like it .
477205:7	He must have been shattered .
477288:10	There would have to be some people w we would n't invite as well as the people who are no longer here .
477302:10	We 'll have to get them out and have a look at them .
477365:23	And the year before so you will have to pay tax .
477371:70	But it 's the year that you have n't , but yo the year before that you have n't yet paid for you have to pay for it in the year that it you do n't make any profit .
477393:12	Ah the ramblers must do a roaring trade .

501205:46	He said they had the wires all streaming down the platform so they had to wire up , close off the platform .

512693:56	look who 's doing the whole lot apparently he just had to do , he just had to model that , he did n't get a chance to do it properly
512696:53	He 's been to the toilet , he did n't say come to the toilet , I had to go and
512775:71	Right , can we just move it a bit , cos we 've got to make the mixture we sort of have to do
512814:7	gonna have to use brown sugar , that 's all we got
512847:52	change of plan , we have n't got erm bicarbonate of soda , so we 'll have to self raising flour instead

513017:12	what you have to do is , Tim have the first go , we have to stir it round like that with a , with a fork , OK
513017:49	what you have to do is , Tim have the first go , we have to stir it round like that with a , with a fork , OK

513290:43	Started to make some biscuits and then read the recipe afterwards and she had to put it in the fridge for twenty four hours in the , the pastry in the fridge so they could n't make the biscuits , there I 'm sitting here expecting erm , a biscuit and nothing came , dear , it was n't one of those recipes that you could make it straight away was it ?
513346:7	You have to sit down properly
513391:39	Was happily pottering about there , did my own thing , I had to open about nine cards when I got home , I did n't think at all
513440:17	At least I did n't have to send mine back , the chap sitting next to me had

513961:186	But it strikes on particular things , it strikes on something rough , but you never quite know , know what , not , no good trying it out because you never quite know whether it 's going to strike or not , when you get to be older , we 'll allow you to strike a match , but you have to be quite older to do that

516211:27	Yeah I did that at school we had to stay in most break times as a child cos I could n't remember , and I , I know that my mum bought me a books so I used to sit for days and days , then my mum going over and then my nan going over and I could n't remember if I wanted to
516215:12	Yeah I have to do it , you know , four , fours , five , fives erm providing I remember those middles then I can carry on , anything over
516245:12	You do n't have to have English ?
516332:70	and I did n't change them all day cos I have n't got any money to buy any more so I have to wear them
516503:15	Mind you they must go somewhere I do n't know where , cos we never pick them up
516508:23	Oh I know , well we have to do some because if we did n't we 'd be under thick feet
516554:17	I 'm sorry mummy had to rush us so much this morning it 's just when we 're in a rush we have to get to school on time you see , it 's a bit rotten when you 're only three is n't it ?
516554:76	I 'm sorry mummy had to rush us so much this morning it 's just when we 're in a rush we have to get to school on time you see , it 's a bit rotten when you 're only three is n't it ?
516579:25	can rewind it , in fact it has to
516615:40	you 're shoe was size twelve and a half but we have to buy thirteens for trainers
516728:7	He must be
516950:10	You 'll have to watch that
516996:11	We 'll have to watch it together , is , is the horse one
517064:30	Well I 've got no money , you 'll have to pay the dentist
517096:128	and we can just poddle him along to everything we do , just , I mean it 's , you know we can do things in the garden , we can do things round the house we do n't have to lay out anything special do we ?
517168:14	No , so you had to sit and work it out .
517169:16	We had , we had to work it out .
517200:7	Somebody must have sat on the loaf or something .
517207:7	Somebody must have sat on it , or pulled it or
517224:9	And I had to spend a whole hour in a meeting not not an hour , two and a half hours in a
517296:32	It 's the ones that come along and just have to do things in the middle of the garden .
517393:7	He must have got a spring .
517453:7	We had to run quick .
517460:7	We had to run quick to get on it .
517465:10	We 'd have to catch the next one .
517471:10	We 'd have to wait for the next one then .
517509:17	Well because you 'd have to pay even more if you did it privately .
517555:10	Daddy 'll have to come home a bit early to have it done .
517568:10	You 'd have to clean them out very did that .
517656:7	Mummy has to get those .
517806:41	Sometimes he does , just before he goes to bed but you have to put them in just the right place .
517967:31	Well there 's lots for grandma so we 'll have to sort out what 's what .
518009:15	You , you 'll have to bring Timothy here .
518015:15	So , you 'll have to bring
518017:10	We 'll have to see whether we go swimming .
518027:10	You 'll have to decide what you want .
518037:10	We 'll have to look .
518047:27	I 'll have a l we 'll have to look inside and see what 's in .
518126:10	You 'll have to just look .
518163:14	Well we shall have to stick to the occasional I bought some of that cheese .
518213:15	I think you have to keep up .
518291:41	Somebody who used to live next door to you , so it must have been Hartsett Close then .
518384:16	you have , you have to choose
518393:10	You already have to choose what we have .
518394:22	Think you , you two will have to have apples .
518395:12	Think you have to have a nana .
518397:10	Mummy will have to have a
518449:20	No , I think I have to choose first cos think you need a nana .
518470:24	I think I 'm going to have to eat it with my fingers .
518484:30	Just wait and see what if not he 'll have to have something else .
518530:4	have to have with my nana .
518531:13	What am I have to do with my nana ?
518656:15	I think I must have watched it or listened to it or something like that .
518689:12	Well you 'll have to scrub it hard .
518753:25	She gives us our lunch and we have to wash up for her then .
518816:12	Well I 'll have to find out where they go .
518830:13	I 'll just have to find the box .
518836:10	They 'll have to go in here .
518994:15	I think there must be another box of these and they 've sort of got in and that seems to have got in the wrong box .
519013:13	Shoes , it must have been on your shoes .
519014:39	No it 's , he he was sitting he had , it must be on your shoes .
519132:12	So I 'll have to go and change it now .
519167:10	You 'll have to swap with
519516:9	They have to make names for themselves , so it mentions about , it says Jehovah verses
519528:113	I have nothing here , but I mean you said Ukraine already to buy it , they 're not allowed calls , telephone calls , not out , not in , closed postage as well so it must be something stuck in there
519605:35	and he probably had n't paid that much anyway so he has to go out the house
519650:16	oh Barbados , but we have to seen if their teletext if they let us do , but I 've just talked to Jamaican people and they said their , their friend he got some contact wanting some order , then later on this lady says no it 's best thing to do go to
519734:27	you know , but she , er I had to leave her my cardigan and she 's gonna phone me when I go back
519940:32	but if I come back in night time I have to put that light on and it 's empty
520004:39	So in everything that we do and staying spiritually awake , we have to do something , it all comes back to you and I at the end of the day , no one else can do it for us we sometimes think well , well , so and so can help , I mean this is true to a degree , but at the end of the day it all comes back to us does n't it ?
520058:63	And they 're , they could cope with any situation , but is n't that a little part we all have to play ?
520071:4	have to leave about half past six in the morning
520158:27	there 's some brain in them , there must be , they 're programmed in some way are n't they ?
520201:12	Yeah , there must be a million Marks about
520217:9	Mhm it must be talking erm some other kingdom , that 's all I can suggest , maybe
520225:7	they must of done
520272:11	of the kingdom must go from door to door , from city to city from village to village , they do n't know about it , but once we do know about it then we 're sort of accountable are n't we ?
520290:36	it 's sort of in relation to it , there must of been some reason why he said that to take them to , hear more to other people
520292:4	must of had a bearing on him saying that
520303:26	but what , but what marvellous faith he must of had
520328:7	There must of been some particular reason why , why , why he mentioned that , which maybe might be difficult to try and realize
520330:79	you know in other words it might take a bit of time to work it out , there is some reason why he must of said that must n't did n't he ?
520330:92	you know in other words it might take a bit of time to work it out , there is some reason why he must of said that must n't did n't he ?
520334:7	there must of been some relation problem with each other , the earlier erm thing
520364:37	Mm , you see at the end of the day one has to work out if this is gonna be an earthly er point towards the kingdom , that 's the different between this faith and any other faith is n't it ?
520419:54	Mm , and that , and that , at the end of the day I suppose there has to be a point for the kingdom and it was n't easy to get into that because all the , the , the accounts are all about how big a struggle it is , to get into the kingdom
520423:37	it is n't granted automatically , it 's something that has to be worked out because it 's not easy to get there it 's a narrow gate
520429:7	you have to have faith do n't you ?
520466:55	And then he replied that well just because you think you 're not blind , then you must be
520468:58	you know like it 's reversed they thought they , they , the words , so they must of been if that 's how it is
520489:13	People have , have got to have this opportunity to listen to the good news erm
520492:52	Mm , see one of the dangers of just reading the bible is that you have to be careful you do n't fall into the pitfall of just reading it when if you do then it 'll all look as if it 's pointing towards the only way out is heaven
520498:29	but er at the end of the day there has to be a purpose for it so unless you , you , you put it into action , then you , if you just read , then you 're in danger of having a bigger judgment than somebody that was ignorant
520505:46	Most of the scriptures are all out , out to achieve that because they had to acha achieve perfection at the end of the day did n't they ?
520531:45	they 'll be made up of faithful ones , that er will , will have to die , they 'll have to shove their flesh with
520531:63	they 'll be made up of faithful ones , that er will , will have to die , they 'll have to shove their flesh with
520562:37	Mm , see that 's that 's the difference which have to click in your mind
520567:41	to the congregation of , of wherever send this letter and John has to send these letters , but the letters were the spirits talking
520579:35	so you know the , these one thing you 'll have to work out in a logical side of revelation
520583:46	it 's all symbolism , and this is one of the things you have to work out , to , to find out whether there is er
520616:32	what , he must of lost God 's spirit must n't he Adam ?
520630:35	Well getting back to these fallen angels in what way must try and lead mankind today ?
520660:9	Well there must be another force that makes them see them things must n't there ?
520660:46	Well there must be another force that makes them see them things must n't there ?
520672:103	You 've got to bear in mind though that , that , that the scriptures which you can use in the Hebrew context were before the resurrection was possible , so you had to be careful that er , that you do n't bounce because when Jesus came to the earth he changed that though did n't he ?
520777:43	those that have n't , are less fortunate than that , there must be something either for them or that they were going to heaven was n't they ?
520787:9	He must of done , cos that 's what they were using , they were using the Hebrew scriptures to , to quote on were n't they ?
520818:57	Yeah but , like you say that the to find , to find out the real truth you have to refer to Hebrew anyway because they found out the sacred secret of God did n't they ?
520821:7	It must of enlightened them on what the scriptures meant , by the sacred secret , cos before it must of been some kind of weird mystery to them
520821:61	It must of enlightened them on what the scriptures meant , by the sacred secret , cos before it must of been some kind of weird mystery to them
520823:15	all of it must , but all of a sudden Jesus came along and then enlightened their minds to the scriptures so they are inspired again to write the Christian
520838:72	in other words I 'm trying to work out why this is spiritual lives and not spiritual lives you know there must be some reason why
520985:59	yes make it possible first to gain everlasting life under the rule of God 's kingdom , Jesus had to pour out his
520998:15	And what would Jesus have to do for that ?
521000:39	Er can explain er why , you know , why would he have to die ?
521012:15	so why did he have to die ?
521072:105	all well and good , but for twenty year , we should n't be talking about this , when I was in Ireland a couple of years ago the skew over overseer said he had to get rid of his television for the same reason , he er could n't turn it up
521209:15	Good grief it must cost them a fortune to erm you know , pay for all these then , so they give you the Walkman to , while you 're doing this and they give you the batteries , tt
521245:10	I 'll have to take my coat before I go in because if it 's a bit smoky or what have you
521271:42	while we 're all waiting with a cooked dinner he 's going to have to go up Gerald 's .
521299:54	Yeah , she 'd been to college but she could n't get her car started , she had to get her dad to drive her in and pick her up .
521368:18	I think we shall have to start .
521417:7	They must have been about .
521430:11	I shall have to go into the garage tomorrow and get a I 've got , I was gonna put it up there actually .
521437:121	No I 'm just thinking about erm next Tuesday , I 'm supposed to working , it turns out but I shall try and work it so that I can still come shopping with you , but I shall have to leave
521454:15	I think they must be getting .
521623:7	You have to into the potatoes .
521661:8	Still have to be considered , you know .
521670:14	Because we 've had to wait for them
521909:29	Too tight across the shoulders so I 'm gonna have to
522014:12	So I actually had to buy the , the cheese .
522033:34	Well I 'm just trying , co cos the cheese has got to go in there as well .
522036:33	Well if that 's gone off then you just have to
522091:32	We have n't got a proper salad , I shall have to start ju , shall I leave salad ?
522110:5	has to be set , cos your dad was using the table .
522226:21	That 's probably why you have to add the extra butter .
522281:4	must n't leave it there too long .
522343:30	Well that 's the thing I have I had to give up years ago .
522355:24	I mean the erm I still had to have completely new guttering in the summer because you cannot get anything to mend the other walls because it 's the wrong side !
522379:7	I had to clear it all off though the the original , what they sort of call , what the dog there
522381:9	Well they had to come out to
522866:9	So we had to get used to the ending up in
522915:7	I must ring erm r Eddy and ask him if you get them ?
522938:86	And the wo mind you , he 's much too heavy for me but of course , well my father was and they 're arm things but I must get some fresh .
522983:37	I hope you 're never looking at me but I have to dinner .
523010:10	Well there must be something in it because I feel so relaxed these days I ca n't get
523081:10	Oh it must have been .
523123:85	And I went up and down the road and miles away then came back and I could n't stop because this bike was very old fashioned and you had to stop it by pedalling back
523154:13	Back pedalling , must n't you ?
523408:4	have to have happened in fact .
523441:20	I do n't think one has to worry too much .
523507:8	I must say , David worshipped rather well .
523538:26	No , when people are dead you must
523960:7	I must say !
524237:107	I do n't know , he come , he said to me er we we well he come over , you see when I come home from hospital he sa , he had to report to come and see me he was a long while before he did come !
524243:7	I had to ring !
524278:45	But they , th th th they just walk on , they do n't have to pay anything
524960:5	had to work so hard for it perhaps , you see .
524968:46	They do n't pay the rent , no , ah ra , the tax payers have to make that up !
524981:12	well , he had to scrape to pay the rent at all !
524982:22	Then , on the other hand he had to go short indoors , well then when the I er th th , th er the interest went up , cos he !
525113:30	Let me see it before , ooh I must n't open it because it 'll be ste
525129:12	And so it must be for your test , you see ?
525377:43	And that 's alright if you 've got a Rayburn but otherwise you have to start
525409:7	He had to explain it to this man .
525411:29	Where did he fund this committee from one has to ask immediately .
525415:32	But I , I had no idea that he then had to be that , being given his own funding , he then had to be organized by a committee .
525415:70	But I , I had no idea that he then had to be that , being given his own funding , he then had to be organized by a committee .
525418:15	I think it must have been some sort of
525431:15	Mm why do they have to have a green field site and start again ?
525615:10	Oh it must be .
525792:36	And all you needed was the brief message that you had to send .
525804:115	wh I remember that when I was at home it was a mixed sort of meeting in which some of the people from the village were coming who you did n't really know but they had to be asked
525822:8	I must go and get some made .
525911:7	You have to come to it
525963:4	had to live so long .
525973:7	There must be something though Enid .
525974:10	Mm there must be .
526098:7	there has to be space for these people though somehow I always feel that they cream it all the same .
526206:28	I feel very sorry for people who have to work for their living now , I really do .
526238:7	That must be worrying , a lot of people feel like that do n't they ?
526369:31	Oh I see certainly feel that er we must be mad .
526370:7	We must be mad .
526373:14	Although we 'll have to sell that house .
526378:15	So er we 'll have to wait we 're , we 're er we 've put an offer in , in on a house in Weybridge
526414:12	So we 'll have to put them
526603:11	although he must be sixty odd erm and it 's obviously a very difficult time for him .
526611:12	so er we have to be decided either way
526620:15	And you might even have to do this er for an interim period or something
526728:60	Oh , oh she adores her , and of course she said it 's wonderful , I do n't have to keep struggling to get boys out of their trousers .
526953:88	And yet you 've got people who run restaurants , small businesses of that sort erm just general businessmen who want , you know , know they have to speak English .
526972:9	And I have to say that er I do n't .
526973:48	But I , I , I I ou really I , I know I 'll have to be thrown into the situation of having to do it
527042:10	I 'll have to give up my art classes then which is
527048:40	Well A Alison goes out for one evening so that means I have to get back early for that evening
527075:7	You must be pretty good at that by now .
527248:8	I must say it 's , it must be good to have somebody like that er
527248:27	I must say it 's , it must be good to have somebody like that er
527250:26	o over there cos it , it must be must have felt quite isolated
527250:32	o over there cos it , it must be must have felt quite isolated
527291:10	Yes Dan must be I would have thought it 's only months probably , but it might be quite a few months .
527354:7	You must have enjoyed it .
527380:7	I must write to him myself actually .
527475:17	And what qualifications mus must you have for that ?
527601:29	but if I 'd have give it , had to give them some water they 'd have done much better but I , like everybody else we kept hoping it were gonna rain , but !
527609:21	No , I mean we have to tops this time of year , we ai n't got any in this year .
527879:25	The first one was so quick they had to get him to do it again !
527937:10	And we had to move all them , there were a lot of hooha about it in the paper about what , a year ago ?
528059:62	job to get out the house for a little while and she usually gets granny up , cos granny have to come down on one of those chairs .
528065:56	And then when Suzanne was she had a lot of trouble carrying her about and she had to be in hospital quite a bit
528178:7	I have to put his shoes and socks on .
528605:12	So , you have to erm pull this erm , little lever at the side and that that 'll turn the snare bit off they can play on there erm there 's the choir , erm
528722:34	We had potatoes in there for a time but we had to keep hoeing all the weeds out .
528735:35	I done that on my wheat this afternoon erm but we have to use fertiliser on ours cos
528737:13	we do n't have to sort of , ai n't gotta take really too much muck
528897:7	You must of learned a lot from your father by now ?

528970:40	Erm so when you sort of dig the ground up you have to chuck them out the way .
528991:38	Dad used to put erm a lot on it but we had to have erm the chimney sweep at ours for quite a long time
528994:10	You 'll have to get some more soot .
528995:11	You 'll have to get him along and you can have some more soot .
529008:106	Yes , erm I read up quite a lot of things about keeping pests away , but I do n't dad reads them and tells me about them , but I forget cos they have to go back
529045:43	Erm , yes , erm if you have n't got a tractor you have to , but if you 've got you do n't have to so much .
529045:76	Erm , yes , erm if you have n't got a tractor you have to , but if you 've got you do n't have to so much .
529473:17	would see that you had to work a bit
529567:33	when they wore thin on the end and we had to put a new link in we never threw the two halves of the link away , we pointed them and made them into staples .
529592:110	And I am if at five minutes to five , or five minutes to leaving off time whatever it was and you would n't say well we 'll get ready to go home you had to pick a half a link up make it into a staple and throw it in the box .
529673:11	And did you have to repair things , well you probably did , er farm instruments , I do n't mean the big implements but things like their scythes and what
529841:9	So I had to

538091:145	like that , no one knew , I was driving the car and I recorded everything that was in the car all night no one knew until the end of the night , I got the tape home , I go this is gonna be interesting I had to do it on one of my tapes though
538095:4	must be when I looked at it they 'd been grown in the field , because it 's burnt , you can see it 's got this reddish muck where all the mud down
538320:7	You must be joking
538475:20	You , you know it must be just like er the Mexican manyana , you know .
538791:15	She says it must be one of them along there .
538945:4	have to make cars with the steering wheel one side or the other .
538978:10	You 'll have to come longer .
538981:10	You 'll have to come longer .
539060:9	so he must be doing good work .
539129:12	Well you 'll have to come over ours .
539262:23	They 've got three now they have to queue up .
539265:64	and Marion 's and if the one that 's nearest the house wants to get out first everybody else has to move .
539275:12	Do you ever have to er
539469:24	you do n't , you do n't have to buy furniture .
539573:9	And they had to park it in a a , an alley on the side .
540103:53	Oh you , cos they just dig through the mountains you see , so you do n't have to
540218:24	It was bloody we well I had to stop because I could n't see my way at all .
540740:10	You now have to get , in er er , because there was a sort of erm gradation from being off ill , which was n't familiar , to being off long term sick which you ca n't have any experience of to erm early retirement on health grounds and you just ca n't have any experience of that either erm to being retired and it 's , i i it 's , it 's quite interesting
540765:142	you know that s some do n't really have a great deal of problem , others really do have a sort of off work for two or three days every month and it 's not a bundle of laughs because , you know , that really must be difficult , but they , they get a rough idea of how it for them
540771:82	i it 's , it 's obviously a thing which , if one can possibly avoid it 's a good idea to and erm I must say it helped but it you do n't know what is helping because you know we do n't know what her symptoms are going to be .
540842:7	That must be the best part of the year ago I should think though now .
540899:11	But then they have to er raise money to go .
540930:10	it really must .
540950:91	he 's not , he 's not , he 's not a , he 's not stupid , Christopher , he , he 's certainly not stupid , and er he must have seen , I mean I assume he keeps his bank statements , I mean I 'm afraid we have one or two bank statements which show thousands of pounds that he 's received from us over the last year erm and , you know , he ca n't blind because they 've all gone through his bank account , you know , he must
540950:287	he 's not , he 's not , he 's not a , he 's not stupid , Christopher , he , he 's certainly not stupid , and er he must have seen , I mean I assume he keeps his bank statements , I mean I 'm afraid we have one or two bank statements which show thousands of pounds that he 's received from us over the last year erm and , you know , he ca n't blind because they 've all gone through his bank account , you know , he must
540956:18	I 'm sure he must be
541020:27	Yeah , yes er erm that 's oh you must because then you have the memories .
541040:27	Because of the , the tinkering around it must do a bit of
541058:35	Cos I I got one off teletext erm er it must have been nineteen ninety now for Tenerife four star hotel , seven days , East Midlands Airport for one hundred and fifteen pounds half board er er the following day which was fantastic .
541076:165	Well they , they , they scroll through themselves , I mean you have no control er they are on three five two is one of the n the numbers and er there , there 's probably be about four to six pages which , you know , go er er er you have to wait , I mean they just go through I do n't know about twenty seconds perhaps each
541085:28	You 'd be interested in teletext , you must have a teletext set next time you have a set .
541119:7	It must be transmitted
541121:9	and it must be transmitted on
541430:44	Oh that 's alright , your shoes are clean , you do n't have to
541633:28	If you do n't want it I will have to cancel it tomorrow .
541716:11	Where it had to be the right name .
542090:41	Yes I , I know that bit I did n't know you had to do something to stop the
542101:19	The thing that you you have to remember , which you tend not to at the beginning is that Ceefax is B B C for instance , so on one and two now if you change channel if you 're on teletext and you want to go onto Oracle which is on three
542123:25	But sometimes like in the Proms , I had to keep lowering the sound
542131:13	Yes I 'll have to erm
542176:18	Not the video , you must n't use the video bit
542180:9	No you must use the video remote control that goes with the video .
542188:7	you must have the two separate ones .
542203:18	You mean I 'll have to wait a very long time .
542275:7	I had to give Fay a piggyback up to the park .
542293:12	Mm I 'll have to watch those .
542294:13	What will you have to watch ?
542333:26	Because there were n't any tubes they had to walk along
542414:53	But I 'm thinking , I 'm think I 've got this terrible feeling I 'd have to come on with the princess , if we 've just got married
542448:17	Well we 'll just have to get the music and
542452:17	Yes but you , you have to buy the whole album and they had n't got that in , they 'd just sold out .
542749:11	Does everybody have to take maths now ?
542985:88	not painful er but it when you er it is when they 're doing physio and when I do , you know , I have , have to do it myself , I should be doing it every hour .
543002:14	Erm I shall have to sit one afternoon and go through it all .
543014:12	Well you 'll have to have yours glued erm tt to the side of the television set when Ernie 's numbers comes up you can
543104:58	But you 've got to , Terence said it 's so dear to be a member you have got to keep going to get your , your money back .
543131:15	I think he must have a bit of cold in it or something .
543214:55	Think there are a lot of children that just have , well I think they must just live on snacks , they just
543288:9	So somebody had to tell him he 'd left them at the
543330:105	Yes er and of course i if er rather like it seems as happened last week , if he seems to have got a bit of time he seems to need to have to extend it
543448:10	Well we must have had this cos when did this come , August ?
543460:20	Oh and , well it must 've been since we were at Malton so we 'd 've had it , what , about four three or four years when we went to Malton ?
543466:14	Erm and it must have been oh I do n't know , two or three years ago must be at least two or three years ago when we were talking about , umm-ing and ah-ing , and she said well do n't forget if ever you want to lose this just let me know .
543466:55	Erm and it must have been oh I do n't know , two or three years ago must be at least two or three years ago when we were talking about , umm-ing and ah-ing , and she said well do n't forget if ever you want to lose this just let me know .
543491:24	We tried one yesterday in and Vicki had to pull me out did n't you ?
543570:15	I think they must have over catered at Christmas time .
543685:69	Well the , all the others go on a Saturday but Heidi said she would be in it if she did n't have to go on Saturday , every Saturday , because she goes riding you see at nine o' clock nine till four so er Wendy said oh she 'll have her up on a Sunday afternoon the two or three principals .
543782:33	But they , they er I mean you do n't have to be too bright to realize that the questions have been given them and the answers have g been given them .
543885:55	Well I heard , I , I wondered about that , and erm I think they must have contact because erm one of them who came back bearing in mind there must be a , a , a , about a three month gap , had had a proposal from one of the persons
543885:106	Well I heard , I , I wondered about that , and erm I think they must have contact because erm one of them who came back bearing in mind there must be a , a , a , about a three month gap , had had a proposal from one of the persons
543901:42	I of er , was it last week erm , yeah it must have been where the the coloured lad
543905:22	Oh I think so because it must be an awful shock for the girl to go round the screen and they 're faced with a coloured although they do n't bother so much these days do they ?
543980:18	Oh well yeah I 'd have to bring it home to have it done .
544019:35	Well that one was the most restrictive because that you had to go , you could go any time between was it eight and eleven in the morning , but you could only come back either something like quarter to five , quarter to , no quarter to six was it ?
544117:12	Well I 'll have to keep doing these pools .
544205:32	No I 'd just be , I mean I must admit I 've , I 've not really seen one for years and years and years .
544241:33	Sorry I ca n't really sort of say I must admit I could n't really see why they should be like that really cos I mean it is a bit puzzling cos if they 've only just done anything , they 've only been tampering with this finger so
544245:9	But I must admit I have n't seen an I have n't seen , you know it 's years well it 'll be years
544324:21	And th th th the tendons had to be brought together somehow is it ?
544487:4	have to wait twenty five to eight before he 'd come in , how he was coming here at that time I do n't know .
544496:42	You do n't , no , I do n't suppose you would , have to ask Martin .
544754:81	No , you 've got Bovril , you 've got , erm , Oxo 's . some garlic and pepper and some cornflour and then your mother had to lob in some , something else .
544880:15	What time do you have to go back to school Alexander ?
544903:12	then I 'll have to wash a saucepan .
544907:12	You do n't have to tell them .
544997:10	Oh that must have been when I smacked my nose on my Walkman .
545106:9	Do you have to dip it in hot water or something ?
545256:9	Young people have got to stand up for their rights Alexander .

545711:45	Well I , I ca n't , I do n't bowl them out I have to bowl them about that far away from the wickets .
545829:9	Do they have to do all your bidding and fetching and carrying and things ?
545872:45	It was the form twos , the only thing that I , that they had to , they had to look forward to in the whole time they were there .
545872:57	It was the form twos , the only thing that I , that they had to , they had to look forward to in the whole time they were there .
545920:12	You should n't have to .
545986:12	No no they had to play .
546056:22	behind the hall stand but mummy must have shifted it cos , shifted it with that er that bag of hers so I should ask mummy where it is .
546059:125	But they had a new headmaster oh he 's just retired , he 's been there been there since Lynn was there when since she was since the er she 's twice that age so I mean he must have been there eighteen years but when he went there he 's er totally the school from the word go

546165:13	You 'd only have to take two boards up out of the lot .
546421:25	I went there about June , I had to go to about June nineteen thirty one .
546472:104	And then , after I 've been in the workshops about a month , a foreman , a foreman of Signals came and they said oh we can get you regraded , you have to go to the Ordnance see , had to go to the Ordnance get reclassified .
546472:127	And then , after I 've been in the workshops about a month , a foreman , a foreman of Signals came and they said oh we can get you regraded , you have to go to the Ordnance see , had to go to the Ordnance get reclassified .

546541:162	And I knew I know this bloke eh , when he was a sergeant I think , anyway he was an officer , and eh , said we go to Sheppeards , I said you silly devil I ca n't get into Sheppeards Hotel I 'm a signal man I had to laugh he said , shame , he said cor , you 're about my size , get stuck into one of my uniforms we had a couple of weekends at Sheppeards Hotel , we had a great time .
546555:24	cos I we use to have to go down there and well at least our blokes use to go down there and do a picket
546702:28	and I got back home , and somebody must have told him where we lived , he got my address from somewhere and he came up to see Irene and I .
546729:69	I went to Tidworth hospital , but he told me , all the time he said , he said they 'll have to discharge you , you ca n't .
546735:38	And then gradually and then when I got to Donnington I had to go , I use to go to Litchfield you see , to examination , then when I got to Donnington they sent me to Shrewsbury .
546750:12	I do n't have to go for examinations at all now , I come under , what 's it , you know my bloody pension it marvels me , I 've been under every ruddy regimental paymaster and , in the , and Scotland I think , I , I at present I 'm with one in Scotland , but eh , mucking about with

546774:10	It 's had to go away to the makers .
546810:87	I was thinking of going to Austria about the end of September October but , if Alexander 's not going abroad I do n't know , I shall have to change me mind probably , I 'll have to have a word with Sue .
546810:116	I was thinking of going to Austria about the end of September October but , if Alexander 's not going abroad I do n't know , I shall have to change me mind probably , I 'll have to have a word with Sue .

548275:31	Hey , this is my lavatory here , they have to believe work .
548281:37	I feel like I can be contributed towards for I must admit that , I do feel as though I could be pulling my weight a bit , especially when Chris worries about money .
548285:16	you know , I have got to get , I mean we 've got to be ready at four ai n't we , which means we 'll have to be ready before we get there ,
548285:96	you know , I have got to get , I mean we 've got to be ready at four ai n't we , which means we 'll have to be ready before we get there ,
548384:86	this year she chose a big one like I got for Arf last year , cos I ai n't got a double of that so I 'm going to have to tape it off , fill it up and then put it back on cos in case she opens mine .
548681:220	I mean Adam 's lucky in that respect , I could n't smoke when I was pregnant , I , it made me feel sick , I could n't stand the smell of it , I had no urge to smoke at all , I went right off smoking , I respect , I was lucky , but I do feel sorry for these people that smoking at present cos it must be ever so hard .
548698:20	Yeah , I think it must have some effect there
548699:37	And seeing you 've got another life inside you , it must be doing something to them must n't it ?
548699:55	And seeing you 've got another life inside you , it must be doing something to them must n't it ?
548707:7	It must be difficult , like I said I was lucky in the respect that I had , it never ever appealed to , to the minute I got pregnant , from the minute .
548709:12	I , I had to really stop meself .
548782:18	I mean to we had to literally eat in the one day
548789:24	do they , I thought they had to
548902:13	Oh we never had to do it before have we ?
549016:7	Right must remember that .
549065:35	I 'm not particularly interested in going round there I must admit .
549122:11	Well he must have been doing that with the saucepan , he 's pulled all the carpet up .
549126:10	Course I had to rush to come up here have n't had time to sort it out .
549197:12	I ai n't had to use that stuff in my hair again .
549199:10	Have n't had to use that stuff in my hair again and I have n't had dandruff since .
549287:44	Cos we 've got television and video and satellites and that , so it 'll have to be hol holograms wo n't it next ?
549346:28	I do n't , I do n't I must admit I do n't like going anywhere without Arf .

549569:21	Oh I know what I must do as well .
550071:21	But I I thought I had to sort of do something .
550256:14	So we do n't have to buy that .
550257:72	Er he 's bought , he 's bought her two other things which we were gonna get her so we do n't have to buy her those either .
550414:17	Suppose I 'm gonna have to ring up again .
550427:12	You 're gonna have to go back .
550459:31	I 've been saying to her well you 'll have to wait she 's been saying her feet hurt , right ?
550496:12	And I 'll have to get a two look , cos she was a thirteen and a half so I bought a one .
550511:32	narrow foot yeah it 's like you do n't have to sort of ones our Adie got is the best
550581:39	but her do 's moved forward so she said I 'll have to borrow it before you

550985:24	I gotta , I gotta do I must make a bed .
551070:8	Oh must be , yeah .
551071:7	That must be it .
551123:36	I do n't really like asking people that , you have to ask them and I do n't know , I 'd tell people it does n't really bother me ,
551236:28	Well we still can but we do n't have to have like a big posh meal do we ?
551257:17	This prat , silly cow has to sneak up her , it 's one lane love .
551435:8	They must , they must start the advert from the end .

551465:8	That must be what Jemima is , a British bi-coloured short hair , must n't she ?
551465:43	That must be what Jemima is , a British bi-coloured short hair , must n't she ?
551489:12	The viewing figure must go down by a half now .
551491:10	Seriously they must .
551700:12	That sink must have got a leak in .
551701:15	I think we must have bunged it up with some gunge !
551726:21	In fact , I might just have to do a bit before I , I might just buy
551733:12	We do n't have to go .
551759:10	You 'll have to let me listen to them .
551806:40	And then I got all the she 'd mis-changed me so I had to go back and get it .
551884:19	He said oh yeah , must be .
552117:10	We 'll have to keep checks on it really .
552312:28	Alright yeah not so bad mate , we 'll have to erm take you out for a , for dinner one day soon and er give you a chat what , you know , what we look for and er to scratch m my back and I 'll scratch yours .
552341:13	What did you have to do ?
552413:12	So I 'll have to think what I 'm gonna do about that .
552591:7	They must find so much fucking stuff that they ca n't tell us !
552687:9	Do I have to ?
552870:10	I shall have to anyway .
552947:10	You 'll have to change that then .
552969:15	It 's gonna have to be .
553048:40	And the amount of people come in , with a cigarette I have to go up and tell them that it 's a no-smoking area and they look at me as if I 'm stupid !
553054:10	And I must have been in a really funny mood , and I said yes we have it 's on the till and he went well I suggest you get them in the windows then !
553188:15	So , we 'll have to take it out tonight , the both of us .
553211:7	I have to go to toilet again .
553268:7	I must say that , no I mean a , by being a pain I mean er just try and remember to fill it in or do th people speaking with you .
553506:12	I 'm gonna have to get one next time , a Europeaney one .
553597:26	So obviously then , I reckon it must be his dad and that 's obviously why Andy saying oh look your dad 's died
553604:17	But then why would he have to go to the morgue for an identification , he would n't know what he looked like .
553726:21	More erm responsibility cos you have to be trained for it .
553758:11	Wo n't I have to countersign it or something first ?
553760:54	Yeah but I think on the back of the giro there 's a thing where you have to countersign it saying I authorize so and so
553821:16	Or that I would have to say oh Simon told me , and I do n't think that is a very good thing to do really .
553907:33	No I 've been thinking about that actually , I must
553911:33	Cos you ca n't just write to someone , you have to want to write to them really .
553988:9	But you must have met him , he 's been up here a couple of times .
554006:39	I looked at it the other day and I thought I must remember to ask .
554040:30	it 's a very erm uncommon name so it must have been him or one of his relations .
554047:10	yeah I must do .
554067:11	Do n't you have to can you get it back ?
554099:14	Yeah th but I must admit it was n't like that all hours of the day , they had , they just had massive lulls when they all just sort of sat there and playing like computer games and just did nothing .
554111:12	Erm do you have to have a membership ?
554121:18	Cos I presume you must be able to get an application form from somewhere
554169:23	They did n't a actually I must admit nothing very sexy happened at all .
554214:47	I do n't think I care to be classified as a slag , you have to sleep around to be a slag .
554304:32	But it sounds absolutely beautiful so we 're gonna have to go and visit .
554521:10	You 'd have to be mad
554575:22	And that way you do n't have to just sort of
554609:94	And Ben like when we were sort of there Ben sort of we 'd been sitting around for a while and he said it 's very embarrassing to have to ask this but you 're staying the night and stuff erm are you two a couple or are you just friends so no , just friends but it 's alright , if you do n't have any spare rooms we 'll be perfectly happy to sleep together , do n't worry .
554625:18	Tell you what I must do actually whilst I 'm thinking about it is do take one lot of washing out and put another lot in .
554736:12	I 'm gonna have to start explaining myself to people a bit more actually
554776:15	No , I 'll have to leave at half eight get there for about quarter to nine nine o' clock
554816:93	It just makes me feel , I just ca n't I 've wo worked out that I ca n't cope with this frenzying lark for all the time , I have to have space to do my pottering .
554860:7	It must be something like , like that .
554874:122	Oh at Handsworth , I 'm meant to go there this evening to speak to the domestic bursar the residents ' officer and someone else , God knows , from the university to put my case forward for why I had to leave Handsworth and that , why I should n't pay the money .
554889:19	The , like the administrative people have to deal with your three pounds .
554932:19	Only they , they , they must be f mad with them .
554946:20	But we w did you have to pay a deposit ?
554970:57	And erm y every time the cleaners came round on a Tuesday it 's not ev er everything had to be on the bed , including chairs er everything , you know , you had to have your desk
554970:106	And erm y every time the cleaners came round on a Tuesday it 's not ev er everything had to be on the bed , including chairs er everything , you know , you had to have your desk
554976:7	We had to erm like have , you would n't , you would n't
555043:7	You have to walk that far like to get the bus and then get in and then walk back home , it 's not too far .
555100:17	No , you do n't have to worry about that .
555106:10	She she has to make out a form , with erm what was happening at the time and everything .
555351:7	just have to wash an extra one out .
555375:9	Well we had to drag them down the hall .
555464:16	So erm I might have to go to Peterborough yet on that day and get myself kitted out .
555534:240	Huh , I think I had such a good night , you know what you 've bloody well done he said you 've got up he said before you was ready he said , you knew you wanted to get on he said , and you 've got up he said with the intentions he said , you had them bloody cakes he said before you had breakfast , well I had to with her coming

555603:58	But , I felt , I know , at one point I really thought I was going to have to ring Iris to come and just sit with the kiddies , but I thought well if I drop down what the hell , devil this house gonna look like in , with three of them let loose in .
555645:30	It 's cheaper at twenty six ninety nine , I had to ask about that cos I could n't see it
555699:54	I mean that does n't help as well , I know Sainsbury 's or Tesco 's and you have to keep taking them off and putting them on
555715:10	there must be a reason you know , they , they went well so I 've got sixty of them , they take them with me tonight and they said would there be any cakes available for Saturday and I , I think and I nearly said to erm , well last year you reckon you could n't sell cakes , but anyway I helped her

559300:10	I 'd have to take down the shore , shore tomorrow .
559380:65	So it was n't the bicycle people that , that the two , that they were laying in ambush for , must of been the car thieves they were laying in ambush for .
559448:13	up there so that must be the .
559479:27	It 's a Sunday morning you did n't have to get up .
559488:65	Late night I was in bed by twenty past ten , I was in bed and I say I must of been asleep by half past ,

559622:96	and , he loved what he did , he that nobody could have survive , and then my mother who 's mentally unimpaired , but in sudden decay overnight and she has to look after him
559624:51	but having said that she 's got a sort of ready meal , all you have to do is use one hand either pick your plate up , put it in the microwave and you 've got a cooked meal
559626:133	and on his own , and said to mum , come up here and get away for the weekend , cos it 's a hell of a burden to carry , with no release , I mean even going on holiday , she has to book it , organise his packing , wash it , you name it , .
559644:29	I said , that , erm , begrudgingly I must admit , I said , you gonna stay overnight , no , no , I 've come to take you both out to dinner .
559670:99	but then , married , married he was one of three boys , and his mother never worked , you know she would keep the house clean , as everything , they must have father about .
559780:34	and it 's a long day and then you 'd have to come back and your day 's far from over .
559845:174	I could n't believe it when I first , first year of marriage and when I got pregnant , er , we 'd walk into her , well it 's her daughter 's erm sitting room , she 'd struggle up out of an arm chair and I 'd think oh gosh , I know she must n't get up for me , got the tummy out here ,
559852:15	No darling you must n't do that , I 'll shall , I 'll shall take your cup out .
559855:16	Yeah , but , I had to take over , where she left off .
559872:82	the only one who worked full time , they came on Christmas Eve with reluctant , because I said look I 'm sorry but I have to work Christmas Eve lunch time , and they said right we 'll be there at five past one , and I finish at one , there were there at five past one , they finally left two days after Christmas because I said I 'm sorry I have to go back to work today .
559872:235	the only one who worked full time , they came on Christmas Eve with reluctant , because I said look I 'm sorry but I have to work Christmas Eve lunch time , and they said right we 'll be there at five past one , and I finish at one , there were there at five past one , they finally left two days after Christmas because I said I 'm sorry I have to go back to work today .

559946:35	Yes , it 's a funny old thing , actually I must tell you I feel an awful lot better since I 've passed my I suppose , last Friday I saw a Solicitor and the divorce is now actually sat up on it 's merry way rejoicing , and
559974:24	I 'm , I think I had to do a days .
560048:15	Well this week I have to fly up to Liverpool on the early morning shuttle
560074:98	population , whereas in a public library there are people using the , some of for life so therefore you ca n't even send year in and year out they have to constantly changing
560083:27	you do n't hate someone , because they have to
560091:53	If they 're sick in their heads , if they 're sick in their heads and they have to rape little girls .
560096:59	Mm , it 's very easy to think that , until you know them as people , I must admit , there are ,
560105:9	and you have to try and cover over , you ca n't say , god you 're vile are n't you ? , but erm ,
560115:35	I said I can understand , he said I had to turn and walk away because my fingers were itching
560225:85	I think some , some of the illness are so devastatingly terrified , that you can only think thank god , not to have that , because it must be so frightening , unlike some of these schizophrenia are hair raising
560340:15	she said he must n't lick it .
560341:13	yes he 'll have to have a collar on .
560347:29	Cos normally they are n't stitched , they have to heal by nature
560376:7	had to have one for a short while , she was quite young and I , we 'd only just moved here and I took her to the vet the used to be in Sandhurst , they said it was a bee sting , they put purple stuff on it
560383:41	a bald patch , yes , so she had wear , actually we had to cut down a plastic bucket cos she was a big dog
560400:13	Of course you must of emptied his lower bowel , when she did the operation
560402:49	so there would of been nothing there for him to go for , you must of been ever so worried following him around watching him .
560476:18	, she said he must not strain , and I 've been petrified
560549:31	That 's why he 's licking cos it must itch like made .
560621:7	You have to watch him he 's going deaf
560633:7	I must erm
560708:10	Well it must have been hurting you to make you do that .
560724:11	Well I had to have something to perk it up and vegetables are getting a bit iffy at this time of year .
560773:10	I 'll have to go and have a look at it .
560865:41	Suppose she 's nice cos she 's handier , do n't have to bend down ,
560873:12	Well I 'll have to have it if I want to throw it .
560981:17	That 's like we have to .
560982:9	snow I have to shift .
560987:7	I have to , cos with the with the pan although I 'm bending , it 's , it 's not too bad because it 's not too heavy for me .
561050:7	I must have been there about five or ten minutes ?
561122:7	I had to laugh .
561123:7	He must forgive us ladies do a sidestep .
561130:13	Oh I 'll have to keep my eyes open .
561187:17	Where you used to have to send the

561394:23	And I said to Polly they must make them , yeah
561404:173	Yes , I 've got yeah I know they did , but I think after a while they stopped doing that I think the latest ones you 'll find do n't , do n't do that , they gave , you know , after a while they gave that up , but I , I must check on that , I must check on .
561404:190	Yes , I 've got yeah I know they did , but I think after a while they stopped doing that I think the latest ones you 'll find do n't , do n't do that , they gave , you know , after a while they gave that up , but I , I must check on that , I must check on .
561410:148	Yes , yes , well I mean , that 's , that 's , if , I mean if we can get him one for his birthday that , get the problem of our shoulders sort of thing , that 's his then , then he , he has to take his .

561645:31	Did it , did it have , does it have to be a , a
561651:7	They must have just forgotten
561664:53	And the , several times I 've bought picture of them particularly because I have n't had to pay the postage ,
561740:39	No , he 's being buried today , I think it must of happened last Friday , or something like that .

561787:7	he must be knocking thirties that .
561812:29	Erm , and feeling there was it must of been he said today I 've cooked Sunday lunch and erm , she ate half of it and I thought then she finished it .
561829:10	But I had to say I 'm sorry Richard , and he said you 're very welcome to come to the service
561837:7	I must have one Sunday in the year when we have Sunday lunch at mid-day and not in the evening , because , you know I get to carol services on And he said oh that 's alright , mum and dad eat mid-day anyway so they only want , erm , they only want biscuits and cake and maybe a bit of bread and butter what can you do ?
561939:19	I did n't either I must of .

562346:14	But I , I must .
562361:37	and of course it was all squashed up either side , we have to wait until it 's dry now .
562365:90	Oh , oh it 's strong , he said and you should n't leave it till ten o' clock at night , then it 's on a cold night and have to open the windows

563772:30	Oh God they 'd look macha I 'd have to strap them under my arms !
563838:199	And they had white , the whole lot like , and they stripped off right down to a white G-string , then they turned all the lights off and dropped them and by the time they 'd put the lights black on , back on , I ca n't speak now , they 'd had , they had a black one on so they , what they must have had , they well they do , they have loads of them on , they just peel them off like one after another never actually see them naked .
563930:22	Well I take it it must have been , yeah , there was a helicopter in the garden and somebody said he 'd flown friends in in the afternoon , so I do n't know .
563934:27	Where 's he making it , he must have had money he did n't just buy those fields and make money and have a big house like that .
563944:7	there must have been some money there first .

564662:132	Yeah it says , I read the thing and it says I have n't gotta let them in unless they 've got a warrant so the first time they come they would n't have a warrant , surely , so they 're gonna have to go away and get a warrant and in that time then I 'd have to get a licence would n't I ?
564662:175	Yeah it says , I read the thing and it says I have n't gotta let them in unless they 've got a warrant so the first time they come they would n't have a warrant , surely , so they 're gonna have to go away and get a warrant and in that time then I 'd have to get a licence would n't I ?
564844:10	I 'll have to pay for mine I have n't got any in .

564933:29	Oh D Deb I tell you what it must be amazing .
565102:13	What did you have to do with it ?
565190:23	She was sitting there tonight she had to buy one of them bar .
565465:7	You had to read it use Sean 's library book .
565473:85	Nebbins was Mr Cooper 's only horse who worked very hard , pulled the plough and the hay cart , and his , all the other jobs that a horse had to do on a farm .
565776:22	Well I told you you 'd have to order it .
565798:13	Because you 'd have to go and see whoever 's in charge .
565832:10	I 'll have to buy one before then .
566052:33	Yeah , cos it was you with erm well it must have been some years ago .
566109:7	I must fill it out .
566266:7	I had to give him a bloody week !

566454:32	Only manage Tuesday Bill , you 'll you 'll have to have half day will you ?
566468:10	I 'll have to cha , change it .
566691:12	Well you 'll have to
566769:7	You have to excuse me being gruff .
566822:10	We 'll have to do a little pas de deux here and turn the car around .
566865:9	so it must be an accident !
566985:10	You 'll have to excuse it being a bit cold cos we 're walking around with all windows
567005:10	You 'll have to excuse the washing .
567032:7	I must show you this blind .
567034:9	And I have to sh make an Austrian blind .
567185:74	they want somebody to go down so we could have but a bit but , mum cos he said well you 'll have to wait a while !
567317:25	But it 's , well considering he had to re-putty all the windows , it was n't just like he had to one
567317:65	But it 's , well considering he had to re-putty all the windows , it was n't just like he had to one
567319:7	he had to
567326:7	Mine have got to be re-puttied as well , in places , quite a bit .
567345:47	Well it 's never been serviced since the day we bought it and that must be a good ten years ago .
567433:125	she probably would n't become a manager , because usually you think you can change and develop but I think she 'll be then be able to become a manager and she 'll sort of learn , but she 'd have to actually change her personality for it .
567434:9	Would she have to change her personality or not ?
567514:25	So that was the embarrassment I had to do when we went and saw er , Mr erm I had to say to him , you charge BUPA rates do you ?
567514:68	So that was the embarrassment I had to do when we went and saw er , Mr erm I had to say to him , you charge BUPA rates do you ?
567575:42	So they had this girl which they showed er , where they had to break all the bone up under here
567676:7	you have to do anyway ?
567685:70	the other one , but even though it opens outwards , a bit comes in and a bit comes out and so he had to chip away at the
567692:27	I came in yesterday cos I had to decorate it so that er get it tiled , and get it furnished and
567923:40	and things like that so , and Amber and Freda so all your mum has to do is press M R and the appropriate number .
567925:21	Well that 's all I have to do I think .
568105:8	It must be this new dish that 's changed , it must be I dunno .
568105:38	It must be this new dish that 's changed , it must be I dunno .
568146:29	We have n't had a phone call so it must be good !
568277:11	I 'll have to wallpaper your bathroom , then paint it , I then have to touch up the door cos it 's that kind of paint and I had it like , on the top of the loo , I was doing it up a bit , and the next thing I saw was Felix coming onto the back of the wind ah
568277:45	I 'll have to wallpaper your bathroom , then paint it , I then have to touch up the door cos it 's that kind of paint and I had it like , on the top of the loo , I was doing it up a bit , and the next thing I saw was Felix coming onto the back of the wind ah
568346:16	she did n't we had to manhandle the caravan Orford otherwise , you know
568480:10	You 'll have to buy the batteries that ai n't they ?
568482:13	Oh we 'll have to buy them out of Felix 's then .
568668:35	But there 's only really one that you 're gonna have to move is n't it ?
568783:18	Well you 'll just have to get some Brasso out and clean them up wo n't you ?
568816:12	Well , I had to go to Westbourne again , to the to the laser you know ?
568893:25	We 've decided now that you you must n't treat me like a chi child .
568910:50	Well I do , I do let her get on with it , but I have to make sure that she does n't
569096:19	one or two pieces I had to deal with , or bring home with me .
569100:11	Cos I must get to ask her , I do n't know how she 's getting on .
569171:21	stop it , so so he had to erm just talk to our solicitors this morning and try and get this sorted out between the two solicitors .
569177:29	Have you read it now cos I shall have to
569195:104	even though they might be part and parcel of the same organization , they are not the leaseholders so they ca n't make the arrangements , so if they want to make the arrangement they must have the lease assigned to them first , then we will come to terms with them over land and to under le under let .
569202:105	But , you know , the situation is difficult in that if the people did move in there 's not a lot you can do about it because it would mean that you would have to surrender the lease , which means you 've let the guarantors off the hook for paying the then and you 're left without a tenant whatsoever .
569260:37	from our point of view in nineteen ninety three , we have to deal with somebody over a revision of the rent and if the company does n't exist it makes it very difficult !
569265:49	You see , so these people were going to move in at the weekend so had to put a stop to that cos they had no authority to move in there until the solicitors try and get this thing sorted out .
569268:22	Which means the guarantor no longer has to pay you the rent so you you do n't really want to forego that either , yeah .
569350:140	I used to try and not say er , you know , to make her feel uncomfortable and that sort of thing , but I did use to draw the line when they used to be eleven and half past eleven saying goodnight and I had to get up at half past , six o' clock , seven o' clock
569442:132	Well when Ken said about the headboard last week they were selling sheets on mini market I said pink ones and grey ones but I said not while they had the Christmas stuff in , it was before the Christmas stuff they must have taken them out you know I
569823:22	So he phoned up and he had to redial two or three times before he started .
569884:10	You only had to press his head
569989:7	That must be it
570180:19	One of the staff would have to come with you .
570325:7	They must be at the end of the pond .
570414:9	But it must be nearly dinner time now .

586446:61	Because we forgot to do , we forgot to do the spelling test last Friday , so we had to do it on Monday so we did n't get any spelling this week , so right now we did n't have a spelling test , this is brilliant , guess what we do now ?
586458:46	I hope so , I 've got twenty out of twenty so far I have to do a spell test each day with twenty in , with twenty in each one
586497:11	Do n't you have to plug it in or ?
586525:10	Yeah he must of erm
586527:7	they must of started coming out
586545:82	Charmwood the house and she was saying when her mum and dad were courting , where they used to do the co courting , like must of been a wood and that I think
586665:51	Yes , we had the Labour candidate knocking on our door yesterday and I think John must of been in a right foul mood , cos he he says come in and talk to me
586728:84	Well I hope so , does that mean I ought to wait , my appointment 's the end of , oh the end of April I must just be able to
586744:9	but she had to pay a hundred and eighty pounds in all
586769:171	he kept going on and on and on and he said do you think it was an error of judgment and he was trying to get Kinnock to say yes and he said yes it was an error of judgment the way he , he 'd sort of said I think he must of said in the mid seventies , that if he got in power he 'd get rid of all nuclear weapons
586840:7	It must be must n't it ?
586840:13	It must be must n't it ?
586860:30	of course he got all upset so she had to then mess about and try and get him to sleep , which apparently she did
586862:10	but he must of been all worked up and since then I 've had a right struggle , most nights
586864:11	I 've had to go back up in to him , yeah , but I do n't know what happened last night , I do n't know whether he was not quite tired enough , erm , he must of got up as soon as I put him down and started sort of moaning then I went into the girls and I sorted them out he started screaming he did , so I had to go to him in and lay him down and making him lay down
586864:117	I 've had to go back up in to him , yeah , but I do n't know what happened last night , I do n't know whether he was not quite tired enough , erm , he must of got up as soon as I put him down and started sort of moaning then I went into the girls and I sorted them out he started screaming he did , so I had to go to him in and lay him down and making him lay down
586864:227	I 've had to go back up in to him , yeah , but I do n't know what happened last night , I do n't know whether he was not quite tired enough , erm , he must of got up as soon as I put him down and started sort of moaning then I went into the girls and I sorted them out he started screaming he did , so I had to go to him in and lay him down and making him lay down
586925:30	I lost me paddy with Stacey I must admit , cos he 's by then screaming , I did get a bit cross last night
587012:25	Well this is what I 'll have to , we 'll have to find out , I 've not really gone into detail about it , I think it might be actually because it 's er you , you 've got two things
587012:41	Well this is what I 'll have to , we 'll have to find out , I 've not really gone into detail about it , I think it might be actually because it 's er you , you 've got two things

587125:18	I said I 'll have to prise it open oh no , no
587164:13	Apparently he 's had to have plastic surgery on his arm
587186:92	He 's stuck with that girl I say cos I mean she 's a lot older than he is , but they 're stuck together yeah , cos Carol must be near my age
587197:13	Oh dear , must of said that about him
587201:7	He must have something though because I mean there 's another
587203:21	Josh for younger girls , they must think it keeps them young .
587262:68	Er , just as well I did have , yeah , God knows where anything is now what , what you have to do with that now
587273:18	Well he said Mike must have said , what has been holding it up if I , we were under the impression that when she left London , she was finished with her property
587279:12	well seemingly it must be as simple as that
587285:9	So Mike must , said to him well , the thing is well we wanted to really get in before Easter
587287:22	so he said you do n't have to move on a Friday cos Mike said well do we have to move Friday ?
587287:57	so he said you do n't have to move on a Friday cos Mike said well do we have to move Friday ?
587294:45	They get you over the weekend yeah , so erm , we 'll just have to see what happens and have , just have the contracts out .
587313:118	I 'm not doing any , I 'm , I 'm , all this bloody panicking about getting a flaming gas fire sorted out and getting a carpet done , I 'm not , not bothering , we 'll just have to rough it for a while .
587419:26	but it 's not that , you 'd have to have a lot of the fireplace ripped up .
587423:15	Yeah , we 'd have to have the pillars taken off
587425:28	and everything like that , so all that would have to be redecorated .
587472:30	Yeah , leave the front room , we 'll have to , first week or so we 'll have to live in that back room
587472:56	Yeah , leave the front room , we 'll have to , first week or so we 'll have to live in that back room

587587:46	Well no just screaming at the top of his voice , our Ben had to bring him down in the end and give him a drink and start again , even then I had to stay with him until he went to sleep
587587:101	Well no just screaming at the top of his voice , our Ben had to bring him down in the end and give him a drink and start again , even then I had to stay with him until he went to sleep
587675:21	Yeah , well it 'd just have to go in the hall , but , no , this will be better , carrycot and that , ridiculous prices though
587756:22	Yes it is , I 'll have to dig that
587758:172	and it 's everything just to stop you getting at what , well get it then yeah , I 've , I do n't mind some of it , I 've not had a bit of marzipan for I do n't mind these erm almond slices , I quite like them , but I think it must be the texture of the marzipan
587828:15	I know there must be something wrong with me
588009:34	Yeah , he 's , he 's into ev oh it must 've been about six or eight weeks ago he started saying a couple of things and I thought oh he 's coming now , but it stopped I think I got excited when he started saying dark , but that 's as far as it got , int it ?
588070:10	You 'd have to keep me sweet
588184:9	and you have to weld them in
588327:7	Sandy must be having company , pulled the blind down I think that 's why they 've been good about the parking this week , cos I mean Irene 's pulled her car , we saw Irene pull her car in was you here when she I saw her get in it , it must of been teatime yesterday

588425:50	but I said well at least you 've got it all done , you do n't have to rush around at the last minute .
588430:21	cos I think her solicitor must of said something to her you see
588440:127	er , we 'll get it all sorted , you know what you like , you sit there and you think oh I want it , to get it all sorted before I go and move , it 'll just have to be in a tip for a while .
588561:162	brought the green one home cos I brought the three samples home , the one that we 've got down and another one and another one for the hall and stair , but I said I 'm sure it was n't the same as that , but it might have been , but I have to say he always said we would
588567:13	we would of had to
588611:56	yeah , and he wants to , he came home this morning and he said , he must of been thinking about it , and he said well we could emulsion the walls , he said erm , why do n't we do an apricot white , I says well that 's peach , I said the
588674:21	That 's alright that , I must have done six loads of washing , for some reason I just did n't seem to have enough to do me loads
588678:8	I had to , I was doing two what I call mid washes , this sort of colour
588692:25	but a white load 's there that I must put in and must get that put out this afternoon
588692:37	but a white load 's there that I must put in and must get that put out this afternoon
588710:22	so they 'll , that 'll have to come down anyway
588728:43	Now Stacey , I remember , she used to , this is , must be mentioned within the bunk as well , cos I , for some reason I remember sitting her down on the chair to dress her by the bunk
588753:33	And I did n't get ' em , you 'll have to have a , a wobbly , a strawberry wobbler .
588761:12	You do n't have to go you know
588773:47	know and get , cos lot I 've got his card all you have got to do is go in and say the name
588784:16	Well then you 'll have to sort , by then with a bit of luck you might of been established with somewhere yourself might n't ya ?
588793:31	He 's the type that you 're gonna have to be firm with Lynn , tell him the only way he 's gonna accept it , is you tell him you just do n't love him
589026:10	I 'll have to see what it looks .
589077:7	I must fill up the list though because there 's a lot of things coming up .
589110:7	You have to pay for that do you ?
589124:9	Do you have to take your subs and the badge money separately ?
589144:16	The Lake District money has to be in this month , that 's another eighty five , is it eighty fi ninety pounds ?
589167:21	I need some more , I must get some more if they want the children to have
589289:7	I had to have er dinner in Mrs ' s classroom ?
589351:27	Well I 'd better check what we have to do it with .
589363:25	Cos it 's not as if we have to keep it for the weekend , I can do it during the week .
589401:19	I do n't think we have to discuss that while we 're eating .
589441:66	I read it through as four pounds , and Brenda next to me is saying , fourteen and I had to re-read it , it , course it 's fourteen .
589468:15	I know it must be you because it was n't me .
589571:10	I 'll have to check I 've got all the engine bits , whether I left any at dad 's so I can at least stick , bolt
589599:13	And you 'll have to ride on the back , you ca n't ride on the tank any more .
589655:37	Actually I was thinking it would be nice erm I have to make a team up with erm Wendy 's parents and we would do quite well with the joint knowledge of four of us .
589711:12	Well , he must be about seventy .
589713:7	He must be more than seventy .
589738:7	I must get the daffodils out of the porch and change the ones round the house , they 're looking a bit tired .
589790:7	You must get some means of hanging them up .
589804:9	The paperwork must cost quite a lot that they keep pushing out .
589923:35	And the fact he ca n't just accept things , he has to question things .
589929:81	If he , if he could n't do anything then he would accept it and not do it and then try a bit and if he had to go back to bed .
589983:15	I think they must be up that other end cos th there 's about a couple of dozen yesterday I noticed .
589991:7	I must go out and check it .
590041:108	You see when the erm legislation changes shortly , well the legislation is there but when it 's enacted erm they they will become responsible for repairing after their own hole digging and they have to provide us with guarantees .
590072:10	Well they must have a lot of money .
590090:40	If you want to attract the right people and keep them you have to pay them money .
590091:34	Yeah but , do n't , I 'm sure there must be a lot of right people who will work for a hundred and fifty thousand .
590096:81	Now , as the bloke said there , the only way you can do that with people coming in from the outside is that British Gas have got to keep pushing their prices up to make it worthwhile for somebody else to come in .
590101:35	To make it commercially attractive to somebody else British Gas have to got keep lifting their prices to a level , that eventually somebody comes in and says oh yes
590309:12	Well we 'll have to see what happens at Christmas .
590354:24	It 's , I think you have to take a bit more care of those .
590459:11	Did n't we have to stop using it because Chrissy was coming out in a rash ?
590480:10	Oh we must make sure on Tuesday we 're home to record , what time is the on ?
590482:7	I must get the tape lined up so that it 's ready to switch on when we come home cos it 's gonna be , walk home from school if it 's a nice day , we 'll , we 'll have to hurry home .
590482:129	I must get the tape lined up so that it 's ready to switch on when we come home cos it 's gonna be , walk home from school if it 's a nice day , we 'll , we 'll have to hurry home .
590499:12	So I 'll have to get it set up ready for when I meet you from school and then we can switch it on as soon as we get home .
590527:43	So I might need , if I land on that I 'll probably have to sell Fleet Street to be able to survive .
590544:79	Well when I was last playing with it that James kept on er in and in that erm he stopped at the station and I have to take it like that far enough cos I wanted Gordon to be there so he co could pick up the express pick , up the coaches
590600:52	If we 're going to go to the quiz on Monday night we shall have to learn our way round yo and our A fours and A two six wo n't we ?

590832:10	I shall have to see if I can get a sitter for you two children .
590928:7	I must stop yawning .
591005:41	Though sometimes , when they 've been smashed into and then I have to turn the other way , they go oh !
591063:8	I must go and turn out his pockets .
591094:9	And I have to get it out .
591096:11	Well you have to go through all this rigmarole of paperwork , you ca n't just go in and hand over your book and say please can I have five pounds now then I want to go and buy a book or something .
591097:20	In a Post Office you have to , you see , unless I 'm misunderstanding it really , you have to well I might as well , if I go and get it all out from the bank .
591097:63	In a Post Office you have to , you see , unless I 'm misunderstanding it really , you have to well I might as well , if I go and get it all out from the bank .
591102:14	cos you did n't have to pay tax cos you 're a non-taxpayer and everybody that went to a building society got it taxed .
591105:10	You only have to ask .
591106:11	Well you have to be a non-tax payer , you ca n't cheat .
591112:13	Yes , I must admit tha that 's a possibility but er
591188:10	Well you must put a coat on you know .
591200:7	I must get some more , some more out of .
591283:15	just er you 'll have to buy all that thing for ten pounds .
591342:27	I mean , it , it does n't have to
591448:12	would n't have had to spend those hours
591484:41	Or do you want to go on your own so you do n't have to get a sitter ?
591485:49	But I need to be knowing cos if we 're going out I 'll have to
591546:15	I thought you had to push it ?
591577:7	We have to make up a team though do n't we ?
591942:7	I must admit , that 's the one that always springs to mind bu was it Bamber ?
592001:47	I mean , you had where you , it was a hotel , you had to watch where you can take the children into the not that that 's a place that we do n't want to take you , there 's places they do n't want children .
592178:12	Well , I must have been in first year juniors .

617955:67	over round the left hand side in the first place , but she must have been in the wrong so they must have seen it as well , they have n't really got a strong case so they threw it out of court and last week he had a letter , he opened it , from the , from the court , and he thought oh gawld here we go again , he 's got jury service , oh

619294:15	He thought he had to be right , yeah that 's right
619314:30	so he said I said I do n't have to tell you where I were last night David , I were out , so I said even if I were in it 's none of your concern I said what I do in my private time is up to me , he said well why was n't you there ?
619336:82	you know , and so I avoided her , but I would tell her , but if I saw her I would say Jenny I must admit I did see you going in The General but I did n't come out because I was so upset , but I , I wonder what she 's doing , cos she , I heard she 's got her own business , but I ca n't see that .

655140:7	Yeah must be quite rare .
655148:10	Yeah he had to .
655181:11	Because you have to find all the literature everywhere it 's printed what the problems is where the printed picture comes from
655379:7	It must have cost a lot at the start but they
655390:9	But they must have cost a lot
655460:7	He must laugh now .

655934:53	Patrick you know where I would like to go and look at this thing we have to
655937:7	We have to give an answer .
656090:10	Yes you have to careful with er that a holiday does n't just does n't become an expensive way of being uncomfortable you know
656156:12	You do n't have to to watch out Scones .
656206:20	I I could but I have to be very careful
656231:19	We 're very reluctant to have to take three weeks holiday .
656294:27	The back door here you know we had to replace it really .
656380:7	You have to give the doorman a ten pound note or something to get a nice place you know
656382:9	So you have to know that
656516:12	You do n't have to be polite .
656656:48	You still looked nine thirty and then could you make even or did you have to wait around ?
656657:7	I had to wait for about ten minutes .
656691:7	I have to wait and see how I 'm going to to do further .
656694:11	Because I have to structure while I 'm writing I you know so I 'm structuring while and I ca n't write as well .
656710:11	And then I have to start something else .
656730:7	We had to have solved so much problems and I just this way and I just would n't have it you know it 's just impossible it 's impossible and I hummed and hawed which way and hummed and hawed which way .
656731:15	In the end it must have been the right one because I was the best of all and I you know until five minutes before everything finished I just could n't make up my mind
656762:9	and we had to have theory that much you know
656835:85	When I hobbled along with my knee he said Oh you should come to knee replacements How did you take your how did you have to come ?
656841:18	That 's how you had to do it ?
656924:9	so there must be a bit of and of course .
656958:7	You have to change something
656959:16	I know I have to change but I 'll find it do n't worry .
656962:7	You have to walk a bit .
656986:10	You 'll have to watch it again with Patrick .
657005:28	You know in er I think we have to turn off I think .
657012:12	Poor old Ralph has to pay those .
657042:88	you see , you just think it 's or have you experienced that you were , first you had a bad or a good impression and then you had to change which I used to do very often .
657044:11	And then I had to come back .

657279:20	But then she , then she had to write English before
657286:22	If that 's what she has to do .
657302:13	She never really had to do something in English , did she ?
657350:36	and you li , it 's a bit late you have to wait longer but apart from that like , when we 're on the bus it 's hot or so it has had to be set , it 'll probably still be runny a bit .
657350:110	and you li , it 's a bit late you have to wait longer but apart from that like , when we 're on the bus it 's hot or so it has had to be set , it 'll probably still be runny a bit .

667342:7	I must be good I 've been round your mum every day but I have n't got it .
667608:98	I know , it 's just that I remembered picking milk up this morning to make Maggie a drink , and there did n't seem a lot so I thought I must remember

668317:9	but we had to do that with her having a sore throat .
668442:53	Only thing she were n't chuffed about is she could n't cash cheque , it had to go all through bank and everything .
668539:12	Cos Steve always had to wake me up for work
668633:7	That must be good .
668707:116	He come in , his eye 's right out here , and it 's streaming with water and he says he 's been to hospital , they dripped some water in it , washed it out must be mine that , what do you reckon ?
668714:7	It must 've been while I was stood up there .
668771:10	You 'll have to remember what you 've used .
668779:53	It was an arrangement we had I , I would n't phone in cos you have to wait three weeks for your wages if I phone in .
668782:35	So er she says yeah fair enough then she wo n't have to wait three week , cos it 's only me that 's losing , not her .
668785:24	So I thought well I do n't have to wait three weeks for mine so next time I do n't feel great I 'm gonna call in and take a couple of days off .
668815:7	It must be on back .
668870:18	You do n't bloody well have to .

669129:13	Last night he had to put new plugs in , they were brand new before he crashed it were n't they ?
669132:23	They refused point blank and he had to take it to another garage .
669139:8	They had to do the lot so they give us an invoice , we took it in to insurance and they 're gonna write a cheque , deduct it off that thing
669145:26	That twenty three pound odd what we had to pay , they said we should pay nothing .
669383:13	Oh I 'll have to give you a fiver .
669460:8	She must 've left her statement , walked over to her car and she checked the car before she checked the four kids .
669640:110	Well it 's he 's , he gets up at six in the morning and I get up at about five o' clock and I go to bed later than him anyway normally , so it must be
669713:10	I 'll have to t try that number seven .
669791:31	Reason they 're mixed up he , he must 've been in there messing about with them .
669811:28	Well it do n't matter as long as have to go over it .
669886:7	I must be driving Bill nuts with my snoring .
670124:10	I still had to buy three .
670221:138	Well if Steve goes for this interview he 's working till , he 'll not be in till half past eight because he says all that week he can gain four hours work because erm he 's found out you do n't have to finish after two hours , you can work as much you like , finish at ten o' clock at night if you want .
670402:38	And I 've gotta get some cornflakes today , my Gary must 've used the last few this morning .
670445:36	I was that busy trying to convince him that he had to er go to doctors cos I says what did they actually do ?
670840:9	And I must get some Sweetex .
670841:15	I know you must .
671027:15	I reckon they must be buying them knocked off .

671146:13	Well you 'd have to ask me if you can go yet !
671197:10	Well it must be doing well then .
671363:4	must of taken about ten years to make
671409:199	Cutting bricks is another fault of Russ , it 's all commonsense actually if you think about it , I mean actually we 've drove round at night looking at people 's walls and things like that and some were absolutely appalling , they 've obviously paid money to have that done , so you , you , you can see it do n't have to be absolutely perfect
671459:14	Some it you have to do
671460:24	I think one rule that you have to follow and as long as you follow that particular rule then they can handle infinite amount of power , do n't make sense to me
671474:18	Yeah , so the amp has to be match , match it then ?
671475:12	Or do you have to , have som
671503:107	that 's right , well the thing is these are , I was looking at the power today I , er not read it properly in the past , there only four rounds , these have got to be A , if you want both A and B on
671761:68	I 've never heard that you know until , until it was , this round , since it last come out must be out of touch in me old age

672031:15	Mm well you have to put your defences down , but not all women are like that
672146:202	It 's not cos she 's it , cos she 's like that you know I bought her summat , when ours were not , not very old , I did n't know what to get her and I bought her an ornament , she says oh I wish people 'd stop buying me ornaments I 've got too many , has to dust round them I thought you 'll get sod all next year
672243:18	preferred I mean there must be some more , how many more lines are there , look , hang on then
672259:9	well to have to see take the bloody thing off

672701:7	They have to pay as well ?
672709:36	and just keep them on meagre wages and then they 'd have to subsidize themselves or

674356:22	Well that 's what you have to say , is there any correlation between
674438:10	You 'll have to have pairs and put one three .
674445:77	Why do n't you say if you 're a child you can go in a group of three , if your adults you 'll have to be in a group of two , so the children can attach themselves to any group .
674466:34	Yes I mean that 's the first thing you have to say , you have to think when you look at you keep , anybody who does the whispering
674466:50	Yes I mean that 's the first thing you have to say , you have to think when you look at you keep , anybody who does the whispering
674473:12	Well you 'll have to think of some .
674554:10	It 'll have to be me with Papa .
674581:12	No it 'll have to be Karen and Andy cos
674683:14	Well they 'll have to be equal prizes would n't they ?
674717:24	But we got go grammatical each person has to speak .
674751:19	Or on this one or you have to have the other one ?
674871:13	All he had to do to seal his England career was pop in a two , a few goals like he does at Palace
674914:15	I suppose you have to be able to afford all that if you can afford the car in the first place .
674916:14	Yeah if you have to moan about that you should n't be driving it in the first place .
675015:20	I think we 're gonna have to invite erm Adrian again .
675203:23	Well yes but not cheap if you have to keep replacing them and
675276:7	You must have let someone go before now .
675334:9	And you have to flash flash flash flash flash before you know oh , oh , ooh !
675354:7	You have to send off .
675400:7	Why must you check , every time ?
675424:18	Looks like you 'll have to sort of like put it up for a day and then take it down for a week and put it back in again .
675429:11	Even your Bounty must taste a bit poorly .
675482:19	So I mean the seal must keep it all in until you open it up .
675551:10	I 'll have to lob that
675631:12	And this lot have got to go first have n't they ?
675702:23	I think he 's gonna have to raid the bottom divisions again , you know .

675771:12	I did n't have to say anything .
675868:36	Surely they 've been for the last four years and they must or do they just keep it at eighty one then they go to ninety ?
675939:7	We have got to get another goalgetter .
675998:51	I mean if you 're gonna have McGoldrick as a sweeper then you 'd have to bring Mortimer back but
676213:27	They went to total excess and then they had to come back the other way .
676306:25	Well she might , but you might have to wait till after Christmas for it .
676352:10	You 'll have to listen to it then .
676439:34	But they 're above us on cos our goal average must look absolutely diabolical now .
676440:12	The goal average must
676801:18	I think it 'll have to be put in the garage and then put in the car once a week or something .
676829:10	Oh it must be funny working for Palace at the moment .
676867:20	We are told that we have to pay Swindon another fifty thousand if he plays .

723782:12	It does n't have to be a nice shape it 's just that so that if the nail polish does n't
723847:20	I said then all you have to do is tell her how much she hurt you the last time
723965:15	You know there must
723968:7	there must have always been asthma .
723972:4	must be awful !
723973:7	There must have always been asthma whether it 's
723998:12	he did n't have to have one of these .
724026:7	She had to
724112:68	she used to , bu no , she us used to have one if she used that and she used to have to bandage them
724282:22	Basically , like but she was must of been such and such champion , I mean I did n't appreciate probably how good she was , sort of thing because I 'm not in their show circuit but probably she was the you know , one of the top
724289:9	So she must of been good .
724299:29	Yeah , it was erm you did n't have to go that far out but they ha they owned a bit of land and stuff
724351:13	Cos the carpet must have been worth a bloody fortune anyway !
724411:26	Oh I hate it , when you have to ask
724476:69	It 's a little lad and I I looked through a window , I could see Judith holding this baby but you had to walk round to get to her and I knew before you 'd got there and you were all over the moon about this little baby and everything
724488:18	I think they 'll have to tell her that sometime !
724552:24	to Mr and Mrs K so , I had to put a note
724603:7	Somebody must of spent hours thinking
724690:9	But you have to be really slow .
724876:10	Oh you have to ring up
724938:9	Do you have to keep ?
725000:37	he 's alright he you can stroke him but you have to go slow towards him .
725047:7	They must have done .
725081:7	She must be
725094:38	Well if you rung you could always say oh I 'll have to go cos somebody at the door if she starts going on a bit long .
725096:36	Say ooh there 's somebody at the door , have to go .
725102:55	Well if you did n't ring tonight and rung tomorrow and rung early on-ish and you 'll have to say
725104:47	ooh our Michael , ooh , ooh there 's somebody at the door , I 'll have to go .
725109:45	And you could have ten minutes on the phone and say ooh I 'll have to go , there 's somebody at the door .
725112:33	say ooh I just seen Michael passing , I 'll have to
725122:7	It must be rheumatic this in here ooh god it hurts .
725146:7	They must go to that sewerage is n't it ?
725150:7	They must go at the break of day , you know ?
725159:48	They 're shutting the skips down and then anything that you take then you have to take straight to the tip .
725165:26	and then he can have what they have to put price in and then they , they have the scrap out of them see and all the rest of it .
725245:29	It wo n't go any tighter , you 'll have to put more paper in it if you wanna
725264:9	And Michael had to put a lot of paper in to
725289:38	He should have left the bloody things off because they 're gonna have to take them off if they have their carpets down and might have to have something planed off them or something might n't they ?
725289:79	He should have left the bloody things off because they 're gonna have to take them off if they have their carpets down and might have to have something planed off them or something might n't they ?
725290:63	left them up , left them up or something I do n't He said on the night he 'll have to come again and have a look at it .
725358:12	I 'll have to get some wood preserver or creosote and
725478:10	We 'll have to go
725491:17	Do you remember I had to have erm I rang Michelle and er what do you call it 's dad come out .
725727:7	You have to do if you 're doing that you have to have all the ins and outs plus a circulation flow .
725727:37	You have to do if you 're doing that you have to have all the ins and outs plus a circulation flow .
725834:24	I 've just seen yeah he must have an interview .
725870:12	And er they had to repossess it and he was paying .
725954:35	You know , it 's a separate thing so there must be a separate price , it would cost a bloody fortune .
725973:51	Yeah it 'd be erm Jim said there would be no problem because his men have to empty their own chemical loos anyway .
725981:10	I 'll have to er give her a ring to and tell them to send me the advert .
725999:18	But see the reason I have to send this to Liverpool for them to put it in
726001:9	cos it has to go through our advertising agents .
726006:12	So they 've had to do it so I mean she quoted me
726077:5	must be a good microphone stand surely ?
726164:7	That must be something
726227:46	which is a church hall , they do n't have a charge , you have to make a contribution .
726252:17	I mean if we have to
726263:38	Alright and if we ca n't find anyway where we 'll have to out and come back here .
726408:10	Well you have to furnish them as well do n't you ?
726412:12	And you probably have to hire them by the week do you ?
726474:54	But if he says I 'm sorry , I have n't got the equipment we then have to go outside
726503:91	Cos if you put survey instead of census at the bottom , I mean I know that 's not strictly speaking how it should be , but they must have signs for us to survey because they have their own , presumably they have their own surveyors go out and
726543:26	Have a look at the erm we must have a count but yes , have you got that report ?
726620:25	to insert the Welsh because John will have to send the original off for
726652:13	Obviously that 'll have to be when we 've fixed the sites
726847:23	Task schedules , ooh I 'll have to get the form .
726959:12	We 're gonna have to put
726992:24	Well no but that 's where I had to go .
727037:15	Well that one you have to ring the head office in Bangor , I had to ring her when I got back .
727037:47	Well that one you have to ring the head office in Bangor , I had to ring her when I got back .
727045:72	And she did n't say no full stop , she said oh she said I 'm not sure she said , I 'd have to enquire about that .
727127:13	Oh they have had to drop their prices .
727128:10	They 've had to go for the we did them a few sort of quotes on the survey side of this Arrow Park and er we 've gotta , you know , really stick to this tight budget because it 's the only way you can get them no matter what people are telling you erm about the recession being over , people still want things for nothing .
727129:14	So this survey might have to be done at the beginning of April .
727149:10	You 'll have to er take the registration of every bloody car !
727159:17	But you do n't necessarily have to say the whole number .
727162:20	Yeah , you do n't even have to say the the make .
727193:10	Well he must be fiddling it cos he , he 's never bloody worked it .
727363:9	But I must admit they were very nice .
727454:7	She must be having one , put them straight in the cups .
727456:7	She must have made one .
727474:11	You 'll have to check them teas , one 's got a little bit less sugar than the other .
727789:29	But then again I said perhaps they 'll have to perhaps they 'll be thrown on one side some of them .
727798:7	I must admit I did recognize a few outfits that me and Nicola used to wear .
727827:12	And she 's had to have someone to help her to do , to
727851:7	Mrs has got to work with the times has n't she ?
728091:33	cause a bit of trouble down there but I must say we do n't have it here now .
728147:43	and being that she 's not very good on her legs well , she has to have one to come out .
728197:12	so er we must remember to buy him a card and something
728225:12	and they 've had to have er , no end of injections , different injections
728229:137	I forget the country , I could n't remember Eileen was laughing , so she says I do n't know how Kevin would be , I do n't know whether it 's today , he 's gone she said , he 's had to have one up his bum
728266:15	morning , but it must 've been alright because er he was going off with David , I said you got tablets for him and she said yeah plenty of stuff for him , anyway , he seemed , he looked alright anyhow
728567:108	but like say I 'm alright like cos Mike does n't have a shirt for work or anything like some people , with , with , they 've got an office job , he 'd have to have five clean shirts for the week would n't he ?
728569:37	And all ironed and , I 'm glad I do n't have to do that , he has his old jumper on and a T-shirt smashing
728594:78	Oh I 'm gonna start going , I have n't been swimming for that long and I 've been saying off and on oh I must go , I must go , but when it 's so cold outside you do n't feel like coming out with all wet hair and all that
728594:92	Oh I 'm gonna start going , I have n't been swimming for that long and I 've been saying off and on oh I must go , I must go , but when it 's so cold outside you do n't feel like coming out with all wet hair and all that
728627:221	like for a kick off , he went down to the skip last Saturday , the tip , we had , er he was clearing out the back yard , he took some rubble and boxes and things down there , and he was talking to the fellow there they said oh , he said er they were shutting this skip , er they 're moving it down the road and you 'll have to pay , you 'll have to pay to tip your rubbish
728627:239	like for a kick off , he went down to the skip last Saturday , the tip , we had , er he was clearing out the back yard , he took some rubble and boxes and things down there , and he was talking to the fellow there they said oh , he said er they were shutting this skip , er they 're moving it down the road and you 'll have to pay , you 'll have to pay to tip your rubbish
728631:58	If it 's a works van tipping rubbish , they 'll charge them more , but you 'll have to pay , I do n't know whether they 'll do it by the load or by the bin bag or , what , you 'll have to pay to dump your rubbish .
728631:138	If it 's a works van tipping rubbish , they 'll charge them more , but you 'll have to pay , I do n't know whether they 'll do it by the load or by the bin bag or , what , you 'll have to pay to dump your rubbish .
728715:47	Oh and you used to let us stop up and watch him , it must of been on at about nine o' clock or something
728752:12	but , that must of been , was that when the fire was still there then that was with the
728796:126	Alright , she 'll be expecting she reckons she 's due on the twenty third of March , but the hospital say it 's , it 's the twenty ninth , so it 'll be next week , I 'll have to give a ring , we went to see her the other week , to see how she was , erm we went round er one night , I rung her up to see if she 'd be in , I said right we 'll be round for an hour
728849:34	Oh she 's , but she 's gone nice , I must admit , cos I always did like her , even though like they use to say she was spoilt and that , well , you ca n't help it
728884:45	yeah I said if you 've lost interest in him then all you have to do is tell me , I said there 'll be plenty of other people
728907:4	must be terrible to be
728909:11	because they must be up to their eyes in debt
728910:51	Well , I do n't know really whether they are or not , I mean he must earn damn good money , erm not so much off his that
728928:28	for Steven would come in and he 'd have to wash all up
728958:8	you have to sit with your memories now , do n't you ?

729153:32	I think you have , I think you have to bear in mind the er circumstances
729205:10	I 'll have to get this on tape just to prove that
729217:95	Well he supposed to give up smoking , it had caused clotting in one of his legs and then it just whipped over to the other one , he 's had to have it cut off
729337:10	it 'll have to go on the document location erm sheet B eight or something is n't it ?

736549:7	That must be kids innit ?
736763:7	Just have to wait and see .
736805:11	You 'd have to pay for exams and all that , but it 's all paid for at the end of the day innit ?
736824:60	No , its not being in concert , that Jason , that something being taken for years , it must of been , Jason or whatever he 's name is .
736825:13	Jack , he must of been painted for years , he 's been on ship .
736834:9	All you have to do is get one mug buy it , too buy it , he 's made ai n't he , ah ?
736924:27	That , that letter I 'd written must of done the trick .
737006:16	well funny , that must of taken quite a lot for that actor to play cos he gets chucked around and sort of things do n't he ?
737060:12	Yeah , you have to give back what you do n't use .
737237:12	You would n't have to worry about them that 'd solve the struggle , trouble er you got them off the
737238:7	Even have to have the same as one another !
737242:7	cyclists must wear them .
737422:9	but you must have seen the metal nut in the front !
737495:29	Yeah cos you 're not out in the morning must of heard from here .
737545:11	I 'll have to carefully borrowed off him , he never looked
737563:141	I almost caused an accident coming back from Bedford yesterday , there 's somebody in an X R three i right up my arse so I just coming onto the motorway , the M four to Bracknell and erm comes right up my arse and I had to come out cos there was this car coming on you know , from further up the the lane and it was coming on and I was already on , so I overtook it let it did to let it come out you know ?
737620:19	Well they they do n't have to sit right up your arse , on your tail .
737640:131	Cos they they they 've obviously not made sense to realise that , a dog might run out in front of you but you 're doing sixty in a in a sixty zone and forty in a forty zone you 're gonna have to slam on your anyway so it 's them gonna be stupid , it 's not you being
737703:59	Not really my i idea of a journey is to get there in your own time , you do n't have to fucking speed everywhere !
737730:67	But then again I would n't be up tha far up your arse I mean , like you sa , you must have found yourself a couple of times getting close to somebody and without realising it and then they
737993:7	You must remember Pans Pans People ?
738004:15	That was er must be about eight nine years ago .
738008:15	Yeah I 'm much must have been only a very young teenager .
738074:27	I did n't like the song but I must admit I thought it was quite clever .
738123:7	That must have been the only man ever to get no points three times in a row .
738189:17	How much is did you have to pay extra on this ?
738228:11	Cos all I have to do is .
738241:9	But I have to keep changing it .
738256:7	I must admit I quite like these little mini systems , they 're well powerful .
738469:10	I 'll have to stand up all day Friday
738541:96	And that nigger bloke comes in who does the ten o' clock news he goes to all these people who live in Essex , we 're very sorry that you have to take up this very abusive language and this sort of shit .
738542:18	And comes on you have to admit though , you are fucking crap , ooh .
738551:20	I did n't realize I had to I just filled up
738671:53	Just cos you 've messed up your practical your your personal life it do n't mean you have to take it out on the rest of us .
738775:7	It must be the most emotionally unstable province in the world , that .
738857:4	have to go through some tests .
738869:10	They they had to they had to cut the scenes cos that Gary died half way through did n't he ?
738869:21	They they had to they had to cut the scenes cos that Gary died half way through did n't he ?
738876:7	He must go to the most expensive dentist on the face of the earth .
738999:8	You have to do that , it 's Seamus O Seamus , how are you doing Seamus ?
739121:26	I do n't see why we should have to
739132:63	Cos I 've already sussed Jim out anyway cos he said it was on my contract saying I had to do the four hours .
739180:19	I know that cos I had to work at it when I first come here
739409:9	So it must have one of those self-adjusting microphones .
739569:38	No I 've been here more than five years so they 'll have to give me five week 's notice .
739630:10	Oh they had to fucking swap them so
739859:7	Fucking had to be in there did n't they ?
739882:7	I had to my wife .
739894:10	Oh I had to get something out the car as well you know ?
739902:10	She 'd have to ask fucking nicely .
739903:10	She 'd have to ask fucking nicely .
739946:12	I 'm gonna have to pop up there one week with you .
740035:14	No you do n't have to but they want as many done as possible .
740087:7	He must be .
740248:29	What sort of what sort of working conditions must those poor souls work in to get agony like that ?
740390:79	There 's no way it should be that complicated a lot of the problems are caused by the rules being so complicated that you have to be working in that particular field
740439:17	The thing is you have to look at your source of information for that .
740506:41	and I think well where are they going short , because they must be .
740513:77	Cos we 'll end up with no mortgage , we 'll get I do n't , I do n't know , if I , I must admit I rather fancy the erm , the old er the erm , a re-employed pensioner , I do n't know .
740547:15	so , I 'd have to pay bus fare
740568:50	And , and you feel , comfortable with what you 're doing , you wo n't have to erm , you wo n't have to worry about the work , if you know what I mean , you 'll know how to do it .
740568:70	And , and you feel , comfortable with what you 're doing , you wo n't have to erm , you wo n't have to worry about the work , if you know what I mean , you 'll know how to do it .
740581:10	and who has to deal with it , da da .
740679:39	Does they tend to have more gumption , they tend to have to stand up to him in the end .
740723:50	He 's also saying , but now I have a more responsible job , therefore I have to be in time , five minutes after him , not good enough .
740731:7	Somebody has to cover our group from half past three till five
740767:70	I seemed to do anything to the car , mind with the water pump I think they check , they have to er adjust the timing .
740774:10	you 'll have to give it as little as it you know
740828:13	Oh my , must admit , gets a bit much of it you know .
740879:13	We 'll still have to do all round the doors , round the you know .
740942:18	I 'm sure they must need er a little bit .
740994:9	And that must be checked .
741044:18	That 's why I have to keep an eye on it cos that blind and that , but it wo n't come yet , it would n't have been on that , that was priced it .
741099:7	I must admit I wo n't be terrible sorry if you do n't see this it is a bit naff .
741108:10	Now I have to put you first on the list instead of me .
741248:7	It must feel strange though .
741277:35	Well it might have been her elbow Christine you must n't be
741407:15	I reckon we have to pay for it are n't you ?
741464:12	No and we had to have what was it ?
741590:7	They must
741665:14	Because we 'll have to get you an alarm clock wo n't we .
741808:7	They must do .
741836:7	I must admit a whippet was the dog that I originally wanted .
741869:46	I 'll tell you what if he 's six months old you 'll have to watch him chewing as well .
741958:26	Well that 's fine but you 'll have to
741962:10	We 'll have to let Grandma know then
741965:12	Well you 'll have to .
742080:30	I gave her a pound Oh you 'll have to get him vaccinated .
742101:8	They must of called him and he went in .
742205:13	And then the judge has got to ask the people where they were and then you 've got to clap something so they clap clap and then you 've got to point at somebody .
742216:12	Yeah but you must have it you must n't pass it on to anybody else .
742216:26	Yeah but you must have it you must n't pass it on to anybody else .
742473:7	I had to sort them all out again so you can see what he got up there .
742494:7	I must sort that out .
742551:111	I mean it does n't I used to hate it when I was doing plays there and you have er grease paint on and you 'd be you 'd try and you 'd have to cream on your face to get the grease grease paint off .
742562:12	Cause you have to put a lot of cream on your face to get the make up off and you do that especially if you 're doing two performances a day it 's an awful lot mess and much you 're putting on your face and you ca n't get it all off
742606:12	We 're gonna have to hurry up now .
742645:7	I must admit they 're lovely to cuddle because they do curl up into a ball .
742672:11	you 'd have to you 'd have to come and get me and we 'd go straight off .
742672:24	you 'd have to you 'd have to come and get me and we 'd go straight off .
742685:17	Daddy 'll we 'll have to do it .
742696:10	You 'll have to get it first .
742722:16	So that if we have to go to Brislington we wo n't get there until ten to six .
742750:15	And then we 'll have to see if we can sort out something else .
743097:9	Do you have to fill that in ?
743412:7	I must admit I like to see that , because so many people , if a dog had to lose a leg they 'd say put it to sleep , put it to sleep .
743412:56	I must admit I like to see that , because so many people , if a dog had to lose a leg they 'd say put it to sleep , put it to sleep .
743446:14	Cos it does n't have to use it .
743536:47	So if you were in receipt of income support then you do n't have to pay very much .
743595:7	You have to have another one if you 're in cou , if you 're not in council accommodation from the l which we issue as well .
743690:27	And so you might find that some offices have to think of two or three D S S offices and refer various people to the , to various ones .
743723:47	You may find when you have the reply back from the employer that you have to suspend unemployment benefit .
743733:13	You do n't have to , you do n't have to claim .
743733:31	You do n't have to , you do n't have to claim .
743759:65	I mean it would n't just be anyone could do this , fill out the back it does n't have to be an E O does it ?
743760:19	No , no it does n't have to be an E O .
743763:36	What they have n't been told is that you actually have to make a claim for benefit .
743764:6	And have to sign on every fortnight .
743770:10	They then have to come to an appointment and be interviewed .
743772:9	But they have to make a claim before you can issue a B one .
743776:12	We , we have to issue B ones .
743993:39	Also if one or other of the partners , well it would have to be the partner that was n't signing was seriously ill then the reduct deduction would be twenty percent .
744119:29	At least they do n't in Bath and you have to write the address on the front .
744122:100	And then if it 's in another area which invariably is if you 've got to give them somewhere like Trowbridge or sometimes erm in Bath or Chippenham You then have to ring up D S S to find the address .
744571:10	We 'll have to apologise say there was a an accident .
744575:66	It did hold us up I mean we would have been down there a lot quicker if we had n't had to
744591:10	You 'll have to give these brakes a bit more welly
744635:18	Good grief wha I always have to put the handbrake on at traffic lights .
744686:5	have to do it over there thank you .
744739:13	Yeah I 've had to re-thread their damn machine for them they did n't have it threaded up right .
744747:61	and when I looked they did n't have it threaded up right at the top at all I had to re-thread the machine .
744832:18	I told her she had to do a we have n't been there .
744846:48	So it 's not his his fault but a lot of the training that we have to deliver is to do with procedures that he had n't dealt with whereas a lot of the procedures are things that I 'm familiar with there 's only some the job centre stuff
744855:15	Yeah so it must have been alright cos there was no letter it just said with the compliments and just take it to
744858:9	So you have to assume everything 's okay
744875:10	I 'll have to get another marzipan another time I 'm not
745145:15	they do n't all have to go up .
745225:21	I 'll get you 'll have to go just go right to the back just at the back otherwise you 're gonna be flipping through millions of pages .
745337:25	Yeah I suppose eventually you 'll have to start giving him one wo n't you ?
745371:50	I ca n't split it again look at the size of that line I 'm gonna have to oh yeah I see what you mean .
745438:31	I like dogs that sit like these I must admit .
745547:9	No you have to do draw another branch coming out of there and there and there and there and you know ?
745565:74	My o 's gonna be a snake and I go right down look at that that 's the last thing I 'm gonna have to be able to do .
745590:17	No you you do n't have to rub out the line you can just draw another one as if it 's coming out from a bit you ca n't see .
745672:15	No see I must admit I wonder whether your Mum will find too much of a handful she 's already telling him off a lot you know ?
745790:23	I 'm afraid you 're gonna have to find your own way to Bishop 's Grove .
745807:36	and they 're easier to get rid of I 'd have to bring bottles home again would n't I ?
745962:114	That 'll do keep those those go with those I hope that 'll fit I do n't know my other one erm that 's fine but the other one was a bit bigger though just have to see .
745968:16	In the end I had to get it down and let him have a sniff before he .
746103:10	Mummy I have to go to drama class .
746245:13	One second I had to do it .

760254:115	Yeah and you er I ov I overslept , well I woke up at five and normally I think if I go to sleep now and I sort of get myself awake but today I must of turned over
760258:12	I do n't have to come out until seven
760260:40	near , well not quite seven so I mean I do n't have to do a lot but I just liked to er take my time and you know
760294:20	No , well that boy had to
760306:114	I do n't know how he got out , I mean our road is so difficult anyway , of course there wa , that night there were two , yeah two when them , he had to get out in the morning , but er , I mean he did it , but I expect it was a struggle
760308:15	you know you have to go backwards and forwards
760313:71	dress making and er somebody would park outside our house , not by the drive , but there but to get in Les had to swing over and round
760316:25	he could n't swing much so he had to go down and back in but er
760317:18	That 's what you have to do
760349:10	Well I have to say Sandra that I would , alright you 've got a lot of mess , but I have to say I 'd sooner have one like that than
760349:73	Well I have to say Sandra that I would , alright you 've got a lot of mess , but I have to say I 'd sooner have one like that than
760354:124	tongued and grooved or , or something pine for the kitchen wall , do it , pay it , forget it right , so , I mean I do n't know what wood I mean we 'd have , we 'd have to see it , but I said to him look I said something 's gotta be done , so I said to him shall we get Gary or somebody similar to do some Artexing in here and he said well with the coal fire and all that he said it 'll , it 'll get dirty
760386:167	Well I said to him look , I said I know I 'm fed up with this thing next door , and I do n't want to stay there , but Alan said that I 've got to stay there , right , so I said to him , you know , we have to start doing something and I said to him something permanent because he ai n't a handy man , I mean he 'll do it , because I mean it 's something like measuring steel innit ?
760390:10	then I have to do something I suppose before we look round it 'll be August we 'll be off to Malta
760408:16	just outside Newbury you have to go on the M four
760418:73	erm , well before wherever you put anything , you know , finished article on the bathroom wall , that one wall we might have to do whatever they allow
760426:18	Yeah I remember you have to
760449:63	and he said crikey look at this , what am I gonna do here and he sort of had to fill quite a big gap in , but he sort of pushed it and filled it and then the wallpaper goes up so you can just see it , a little bit , what 's a name now , just in the hall there 's a bit
760467:13	Yes , I must admit I had one or two people going up the loo and looking , I mean people stop and look when we first had all the stuff outside , you know , what you doing in there ?
760517:22	Yeah , but , no Anton had to make a phone call anyway and he said while he was on the phone
760558:15	I mean you have to wonder
760561:59	she do n't want to go to college or something new and erm she 's doing something , must be finals I would think , think it must be finals and er Sue said to her well should she pack up
760561:90	she do n't want to go to college or something new and erm she 's doing something , must be finals I would think , think it must be finals and er Sue said to her well should she pack up
760566:63	And Sue said she 's got nothing in view apart from that and she said to her you must have alternatives , she 's not applied to anybody or enquired about anything
760672:33	Did you have a bedroom to yourself or did you have to share it ?
760695:8	It must be I was only thinking the other day the number of bakers but er the number of small bakers that were in Caldmore there was the two brothers one was in Road and one was in Street there was on the corner of Street , where the Co-op have that place now that was they were all bread bakers , were bread bakers er a bit further down Street going towards Street was bakery , they were a bakers and confectioners in Street
760700:47	In Street a man named he had two sons and he had , he had to quote , give a contract for it , but he always used to do what they 'd call a workhouse feed , and it was a four pound loaf , when my father died mother did n't get a widow 's pension , what , what she got was two shillings for each lad , there 's four of us , that 's eight shillings and a four pound loaf for each lad
760704:154	That , that was the start , the start of it , I think how it actually commenced so they used to get in each other 's houses and play a few games of cards dominoes and draughts things like that , and they , they took over they must have actually bought the houses before they built the club .
761000:61	and you 'll be pleased to know that because we 've waffled on for so much we 'll have to save the county 's peculiar pastimes until tomorrow ,
761054:11	Shares in had to be suspended on the Paris stock exchange collapsing after the company announced a massive loss .
761067:7	You have to dial the code O six O two if you 're outside the Nottingham area .
761074:38	Six more contestants we need , the only rule is that you must n't have played a phone-in competition on this programme in the last four weeks .
761254:23	And this is the voice you have to identify .
761531:7	You have to live with this .
761532:22	There are times when you have to live with these unpleasant facts of life .
761623:19	Erm but I 've had to give it all up because I 'm too busy , so I do n't run it from anywhere now , but for the last er four or five years it 's been from the Hotel .
761641:52	You done some great stuff in the acting world have n't you , I mean you must be very proud of some of the stuff .
761662:9	But you must you must have been asked dozens of times to go back into the pop concert field ?
761662:16	But you must you must have been asked dozens of times to go back into the pop concert field ?
761670:23	You do realize though that there must have been some people who were saddened by the fact you did n't continue your pop career ?
761679:47	And I 'd had a car crash and it was quite a relief not to have to worry about performing .
761746:9	But you had to get every word right of course .
761758:12	So she would have to she was to given up her career in acting , she may have to take a view and give up singing totally for a while .
761758:57	So she would have to she was to given up her career in acting , she may have to take a view and give up singing totally for a while .
761791:9	Do you have to be so enthusiastic about everything you do ?
761872:42	Sounds as though it was very expensive because the clothes you wore must have been
762215:50	Mind you , mind you I went er through Newark the other day and I had to go round the mountains to get back on that road out to Lincoln .
762245:54	Going through it er would be a problem , going through Newark actually going through you have to go round a system as you as you quite rightly said .
762545:91	then Sandy has n't given me a time but I think I 'd suggested to him between six and seven I think people like that they do n't have to go home and
762607:130	and then finally we could finish off with Bill and Ben the Flowerpot Men or whatever they want to call themselves from and they could say well we 're the guys in between we 've got clients out there but we have to deal with printers and estimators and this is what life is like for us .
762693:130	we actually ended up with a lot more I P R people and we 'd done all the work and they got most of the money now that 's fine that 's the way life goes sometimes , but I must admit I think that depending on how big an event you want to make it you 're maybe as well to keep it an B A I E event and open it up quietly at the end
762714:30	when I 've taken things to him I must admit
762717:30	Well I do n't know it would probably have to be May or June I think erm
762725:106	Well November , I meant the fourth of November it seems to be for ever anyway I spoke to the Head of the Department when they came back and he said I must admit we 've done nothing from the point of view of putting things on paper but a lot of thinking has gone into it I must really sit down now and commit things to paper .
762725:192	Well November , I meant the fourth of November it seems to be for ever anyway I spoke to the Head of the Department when they came back and he said I must admit we 've done nothing from the point of view of putting things on paper but a lot of thinking has gone into it I must really sit down now and commit things to paper .
762759:50	I mean there are all sorts of little peculiarities for example you do not have to be a member of B A I E at any level to sit B A I E exams .
762765:19	because I thought you had to be in post this is what we had a problem with with Napier 's request for recognition
762769:120	Ah yes , but now that 's very interesting because that 's not the same as was the old regulation with the H N D recognition with Napier , and it used to be as I understood it that you had to actually be in membership and leave a period of time between doing the certificate and the diploma .
762885:9	but you must be fairly near the end
762953:57	but you ca n't you ca n't dip into modules of that can you do n't you have to do the whole thing ?
762957:44	but I do n't think , I do n't think I think you have to pay a candidate fee as well as the course fees so you
762969:15	I know I had to explain to somebody in Chambers the other day something to do with the Corpus that it was n't where was the story there was n't a story
762985:32	but how do you I mean do you have to be taken on as officers of the R A F
762997:107	just so can we get back to research about beginners because I 'm worried about how much there is on the tape and you 're about to drive to Pitlochrie erm basically you have to define a beginner to see what they want to do
763000:130	I would say in employment yes , or people that want to get employment example would be yeah at M D secretary suddenly shot into the job of producing the company newspaper now I mean somebody like very quickly has to get to grips with this obviously cannot give up six months to go and do it so you do it on a half day release basis .
763037:97	It 's where to pay to money , and you 're having to go to the bank manager , what would he ask for ? the business plan , and you 'd have to draw that up and do all the and you have to impress the bank manager before he will even consider an overdraft facility , or whatever , a loan .
763037:134	It 's where to pay to money , and you 're having to go to the bank manager , what would he ask for ? the business plan , and you 'd have to draw that up and do all the and you have to impress the bank manager before he will even consider an overdraft facility , or whatever , a loan .
763096:49	Let 's say we earned a thousand pounds commission on one case , and I had to make one hundred calls to earn , to get that one sale .
763110:66	No it did n't , it was all the activity in front of that , that earned you , so you have to break all that down .
763138:28	So please it 's a discipline you must get into immediately , and you 'll be starting that on Thursday .
763234:115	There 's gonna be times when you 're collecting more no 's than you would like to collect , and you 're gonna go home pretty miserable , and this is the time when your partners have got to know what you 're trying to achieve and maybe put the arm round your shoulder or butter you up , discuss these things with them .
763322:41	Let 's say then , I just , I used to have to work on eleven appointments a week because if I had eleven appointments a week , two people would perhaps blow me out , change their minds , two people would rearrange , two people would say no thank you , and another two would say , yes , but I need to do it next month , which might leave me with two sales .
763323:9	So I had to have eleven appointments to get my two sales a week .
763343:50	What I mean by that is , when I ring up Richard , we must give an alternative close , must n't we .
763343:65	What I mean by that is , when I ring up Richard , we must give an alternative close , must n't we .
763354:7	You must be in control .
763355:53	The minute they say well , no that 's no good to me , you 'll have to come and , you 'll have to come and see me at eight , say , well I 'm busy then I 'm afraid .
763355:76	The minute they say well , no that 's no good to me , you 'll have to come and , you 'll have to come and see me at eight , say , well I 'm busy then I 'm afraid .
763364:65	If I 've got a couple of these blank , I cannot finish on Friday night , I 'm going to have to do some overtime .
763365:11	I 'll have to do some more calls on Friday night to try and get those appointments , and if necessary , I 'll have to come in on Saturday morning , because you do n't finish a week until you 've got your appointments for the following week .
763365:73	I 'll have to do some more calls on Friday night to try and get those appointments , and if necessary , I 'll have to come in on Saturday morning , because you do n't finish a week until you 've got your appointments for the following week .
763371:96	It 's no use going home on Friday night and going erm , I 've only got five appointments , you 're self-employed , it means you 're going to have to work a couple of hours extra .
763516:47	What happened was , I 'd go home , go to MacDonalds , and have to go back to the office .
763607:11	You 'll have to go into the branch , but what , if I was your manager , I 'd say well what we 'll do , is keep on working and training , until it 's alright
763692:11	Well I have to , otherwise , I would n't have any effect at all with my luck .
763697:10	We 'll have to give up and good luck to you right
763714:29	I just think she 's going to have to go and buy a dormobile , I mean I ca n't see any other way round it .
763733:31	But on the same score I 'm afraid I must be an a narrow minded urban socialist well okay , I 've never lived in a city but if you want to call me that , fine .
763921:43	Yes , just go straight on to policy and resources , we we have to take it with the main motion , I mean if it 's passed it 's a s standing motion .
764122:23	Not because I suppose and I must condemn any particulars group we all , in the end said not this time .
764144:12	The local authority has to look not only to its traditional role as provider of services but also , this is the critical bit to one where the emphasis is now more on specifying requirements , coordinating functions , monitoring performance .
764149:57	Would that it were as easy as sticking your hand up to vote for it Because I have to say that I see no evidence since that motion approving the management initiative was passed of Labour and Liberal members doing any more than paying lip service .
764164:17	Now but you do n't have to but it in fact if , there 's no point that 's it get you
764208:12	The democratic base must remain as wide as possible and I commend all these paragraphs to council .
764217:8	I must er thank Mr for really outlining what it 's all about and cover all the issues because because Mr referred to no part being taken away .
764245:36	A thought er went , slipped by me er we must upon this council thank the committee staff that controlled the multitude outside , er they were n't trained for it but can the er thanks of this council for their endeavours in keeping the situation calm be recorded .
764260:45	If they really believe that the merger was the best way forward , they must now be be supporting something that they know to be less than best and and this is now rendered all the bad feeling and all the destruction of the past two years , a complete waste of time .
764289:127	So , the situation in that is quite serious and it behoves us to take it seriously , it behoves us to make sure that if we are putting resources of that magnitude or of any magnitude perhaps , then we have to make sure that they are managed properly for the effective delivery of the services which we intend er that them to be used for .
764309:31	Labour will now be on the line they will have to deal with the axe grinders instead of helping them to sharpen their axes and the difference between ourselves and Mr and I have great respect for Mr and I believe his attempt to keep the debate about the future of Highfields and Moat on a rational basis has been very positive but completely unsuccessful and I believe now that we have to look for a way forward .
764309:215	Labour will now be on the line they will have to deal with the axe grinders instead of helping them to sharpen their axes and the difference between ourselves and Mr and I have great respect for Mr and I believe his attempt to keep the debate about the future of Highfields and Moat on a rational basis has been very positive but completely unsuccessful and I believe now that we have to look for a way forward .
764328:30	This is what the people want and money must not interfere with their wishes .
764348:12	No you 'll have to deal with this one because the other one has not been moved yet .
764382:9	No one has to defend anything to anyone .
764393:36	That 's how serious we are and although Mr er has to give his little laugh but I hope that he is just as much serious er particularly now that the political realities are that we will have a way forward , of not only supporting the delivery and management of community education services in that particular area but a clear focus has now been given , hopefully after this amendment er has been carried to the education authority .
764402:67	that Liberals are incapable of sustaining er the same argument in committee , er sub-committee , main committee and council and I have to say er that erm er placing a bet with Ernie was taking money off children .
764404:87	Now I do ask myself this this question erm I can recognise the argument that if you if you 're not actually going to achieve your objectives you have to change your mind .
764412:12	Now er I have to warn him there are that sort of conduct has been indulged in to the detriment of the people of Highfields over a significant period by the Labour party .
764421:7	I have to say that I hope Mr in fact did n't actually write the words of the motion it looks to me and those members of the education committee will know what I mean like another version of the Docklands back garden fudge .
764429:21	I suspect that if I had to find an alternative to what we 've already proposed and what we 've constantly supported , I would actually go right back to the , I would actually go right back to the beginning erm because it would be cleaner and it would be clearer .
764455:7	There has got to be a willingness on the part of all the groups on this council and the officers of the various connected departments of this council to make sure that those teams are given the utmost support in delivering the youth and community service that the Highfields area needs and deserves .
764463:10	Now we must do it .
764472:7	You have to come to a conclusion and Professor er described how we 've had to come to a conclusion .
764472:49	You have to come to a conclusion and Professor er described how we 've had to come to a conclusion .
764482:134	It 's only the Labour party who 's obstructed it so now they 're putting their name to this , they 're the ones who 've changed , they 're putting their name to something different and therefore they 're gonna have to live with it and if you look at it what have we got ?
764541:30	It 's not my day really earlier today I had to admit to being grateful to John Gummer now I 'm gonna have to be .
764541:71	It 's not my day really earlier today I had to admit to being grateful to John Gummer now I 'm gonna have to be .
764543:15	Now I 'm gonna have to say I 'm gonna be grateful to Mr it 's a really bad day .
764545:101	Now what I would like to say is that we 've made clear that we 're with certain very clear objectives in pushing forward , in saying that certain things had to be achieved and when I read the lilac piece of paper or whatever colour we want to call it .
764614:41	And I , I , I think obviously everything that he says has to be taken with a pinch of salt , but we 'll , we 'll come on to that
764678:152	Now to a lot , a lot of people this is unacceptable and terrible and er it 's , er he 's arguing here that the fact is that the , the , the peasant masses have risen to fulfil their historic mission and that the forces of rural democracy have to rise to overthrow the forces of rural feudalism .
764690:59	Mm yeah there , there is a need to exceed proper limits , he says , that proper limits have to be exceeded in order to right a wrong er it 's also he says necessary to create terror for a while .
764691:25	Erm you know , almost you have to go too far or to go such er an extent it would be erm and the force simply to erm stop counter-revolution and , and to overthrow all , you know , deep seated authorities that had lasted thousands of years , I mean to , to overcome that you do need a revolution .
764794:87	but I mean I , I still think at the end of the day that , you know , we , we , we , we still have to realize that we are only looking at , at a minute erm area of China and therefore you know how , how relevant is it .
764822:21	There is a no we must n't , no , things are n't too bad , just leave it alone it 'll be okay , and somebody coming in and saying no that 's not the way you should look at it , that there is provocation if you 're gonna have a revolution it has got to be violent and it is right to be violent .
764822:172	There is a no we must n't , no , things are n't too bad , just leave it alone it 'll be okay , and somebody coming in and saying no that 's not the way you should look at it , that there is provocation if you 're gonna have a revolution it has got to be violent and it is right to be violent .
764856:23	I mean he mu he must 've believed that there is this insurmountable force building up
764888:7	It must be more than propaganda though ?
764890:12	He , he must actually believe in
764989:58	And Mao is , is making a bid A a revolution is taking place and B we have got to lead it and it , it 's a rural revolution .
764993:106	No you 're absolutely right it , it might all be wrong , it might be totally misconceived , in which case it 's likely to go wrong , but to begin with we have to accept that this is what Mao is saying .
765077:48	It depends , if you need them they 're involvement then you may have to do it a slightly different way or maybe it 's the case that they have to accept this or that you 're gonna turn them over too .
765077:96	It depends , if you need them they 're involvement then you may have to do it a slightly different way or maybe it 's the case that they have to accept this or that you 're gonna turn them over too .
765080:48	I mean once violence starts er moving then you know , the middle peasants have to join unless
765179:25	On the other hand I think we have to take seriously what Mao is , is saying that and it may conflict with that , that other view of the countryside an an and we , I think we do have to take this evidence into account , I think it 's more important to accept what Mao is saying .
765179:128	On the other hand I think we have to take seriously what Mao is , is saying that and it may conflict with that , that other view of the countryside an an and we , I think we do have to take this evidence into account , I think it 's more important to accept what Mao is saying .
765198:73	Erm and so now rich peasants are actually actively seeking to join er associations but finding it difficult , I mean they have to be er pay an additional admission fee may be ten yuan or , or whatever , you know , usually far higher than the normal peasant or erm they have to get someone to actually put their name forward to say that you know they 're not such a bad bloke .
765198:159	Erm and so now rich peasants are actually actively seeking to join er associations but finding it difficult , I mean they have to be er pay an additional admission fee may be ten yuan or , or whatever , you know , usually far higher than the normal peasant or erm they have to get someone to actually put their name forward to say that you know they 're not such a bad bloke .
765222:167	Erm he makes a distinction between poor peasants , some being utterly destitute and some just being less destitute but er basically as er seventy percent of the population erm they 're the main group that 's pushing revolution forward and s so therefore I mean it 's this group that the Communist Party must n't alienate , you know , they mu must n't do anything to harm this group , associations the Communist Party must n't attack erm the associations .
765222:193	Erm he makes a distinction between poor peasants , some being utterly destitute and some just being less destitute but er basically as er seventy percent of the population erm they 're the main group that 's pushing revolution forward and s so therefore I mean it 's this group that the Communist Party must n't alienate , you know , they mu must n't do anything to harm this group , associations the Communist Party must n't attack erm the associations .

765296:17	Not but you do explicitly have to talk about class because ten to fifteen years
765356:165	Now th that , that if you like is , is the new strategy that he 's putting to the Communist Party and he 's saying look , you should recognize this is going on , there is a , there , there is a , a growing class basis to this and we must lead it because it is the way forward .
765518:135	tyrants , I mean that is that is more than that , he 's saying that , that y the , the power base at the two level er two I think the local one , jurisdiction , weal people in control , they have got to be overthrown , now that I think is revolutionary .
765655:42	Oh yeah absol you take the political power away so that they will have to reduce their rents and do all of that but you 're not challenging the landlord system .
765838:10	Every child must break away from the parental fold , and establish his own personal identity .
765928:12	His sisters also had to bear tragedy .
766049:12	Yeah , they had to .
766080:7	He must have been aware of that .
766098:75	And I think , I mean , you know , he 'd enormous popularity , the famous photograph with the Welsh miners , something must be done .
766114:9	But he has to be careful not to be the black sheep of the family .
766365:20	Yes , the the the the there have to , there have to be values .
766365:35	Yes , the the the the there have to , there have to be values .
766370:8	There have to be values , they have to be human values .
766370:26	There have to be values , they have to be human values .
766371:54	Erm , spiritual , you you you you think erm , that th they they have to be spiritual values .
766380:15	So there has there has to be an ethical framework .
766382:29	But it 's all very well saying there has to be a framework , there have to be values .
766382:51	But it 's all very well saying there has to be a framework , there have to be values .
766391:18	I think that people have got to turn in the other direction , and really want to be because I see in schools there are
766442:32	I think time will come when we will have to .
766444:90	Because the erm , situation will become so bad , and , I think people might turn the other way when it comes to a a state where they have to be
766455:35	And in order to put a stop to it , there has got to be a resurgence of a belief in values , whatever those values may be .
766459:15	I think people have got to start
766579:69	But erm , nowadays , you , I think we we we 've all got this this this idea , that we have to .
766619:18	But once decided , it has to stay with that until it gets
766672:25	Erm , so you ca n't , you must be careful not to draw the wrong conclusions from the , the figures that erm , we were given .
766716:21	I think in fact she had to leave the Air Force because she had a child .
766727:46	Erm , and you know , let 's face it , I did n't have to go through the circumstances that they went through in the war , and there therefore , who who am I to judge
766795:64	Thank you very much for leading us tonight , and all here will be interested to hear what you have to say .
766872:59	And that , the answers I got from Government was , use a voluntary body , they do n't have to pay that .
766879:38	For someone to come and clean , and then you would have to pay V A T on it .
766880:141	You see , cos they do n't say that , and anyone else who does n't , who does less than thirty five thousand pounds worth of , if Mrs down the street said , I could n't do forty pound , then they do n't have to pay that .
766884:110	He did n't answer it personally , eventually about three weeks afterwards I got the letter from Customs and Excise , who deal with this , saying , in a rather remarkable last paragraph , We have to charge V A T right across the board .
766887:12	Then , they have to charge V A T .
766890:30	I mean , I did n't think he had to have V A T on , I mean , if it 's a millionaire , you know , and they employ la , they employ people to clean .
766968:121	firm there , incidentally , er , that 's surprised me , going to a mar court , a a a court like that , purely when it was a , a application for a er drink licence , and still have to er , er .
766985:28	And it 's no good moaning , so has to go and do something about it ,
767146:9	The police have to do that .
767148:22	You ca n't volunteer , you have to be , you have to be chosen .
767148:38	You ca n't volunteer , you have to be , you have to be chosen .
767226:16	There is , everybody has to acknowledge that there is a difference in the interpretation of what constitutes justice and one only has to see er , the sorts of attitude that are put across by certain judges , as to , erm , rape cases , and abuse cases , and how they , the press would have us believe , pat people over the head and tell them to go away and not do it again .
767226:78	There is , everybody has to acknowledge that there is a difference in the interpretation of what constitutes justice and one only has to see er , the sorts of attitude that are put across by certain judges , as to , erm , rape cases , and abuse cases , and how they , the press would have us believe , pat people over the head and tell them to go away and not do it again .
767258:15	We ought not to have to keep them until they 're about seventy , in nearly the lap of luxury .
767349:118	Now in the eyes of the law , they have committed a crime , but if you put that situation before a jury , and even though the judge may instruct the jury , a crime has been committed , you must find them guilty , the jury 's inclination will probably be to say , natural justice , you , that you you done what was required of you , that you do n't deserve to be either convicted or sent to prison for it .
767383:14	But you also have to take into consideration , the feelings of victims , I mean , it it would have to be , erm ,
767383:63	But you also have to take into consideration , the feelings of victims , I mean , it it would have to be , erm ,
767410:43	I think , I think most criminals , I mean , there there must be one or two who er er , too dangerous to be let loose on society ,
767417:35	cos , as you say , if if they do have to come to grips with their fellow man , to be at least some of them who are going to be impressed by that .
767434:15	Erm , he finally had to shut the adult school , not because the prisoners were n't interested in in attending any more , but because the prison officers and the governor were n't able to provide the man-power to to cover the existence of that class .
767443:27	If anybody went into the prison , they had to be paid .
767456:10	Well he must have been transferred for some reason or other .
767585:38	Erm , er , and he got a ticket , and he had to , you know , you have to take this ticket to the Police Station for not having worn his seat-belt .
767585:58	Erm , er , and he got a ticket , and he had to , you know , you have to take this ticket to the Police Station for not having worn his seat-belt .
767656:10	I shall have to come and do it to your mother and see what she thinks .
767704:7	I must tell you that when we lived in Morley , in , up in Yorkshire , we erm , we were having trouble with some yobbos coming up from Leeds , you know , and we had , there was an old sergeant in in Morley , you know , for years , and tall .
767707:74	he was boom , whacking them with his cape , sort of chasing them out of town , you know , and I must say , they never came back .
767755:7	It has to be some solid reason .
767794:10	Well you have to something there .
767810:14	I think that has to be the chain .
767850:7	You have to look after your existing customers of course whether they are
767856:24	Yeah , but you put , you must be putting about five hours effort of a day into prospecting accounts .
768016:4	has to be geared to the customer .
768177:5	had to say , he just just said yes , yes , all afternoon .
768205:9	Do I have to do everything ?
768352:24	Well I mean you do n't have to see , so this you 've got this sort of social thing there .
768369:99	Erm and what I want you to do tonight please , in your teams I want you to make a list tonight , in your teams of all the things you have to do at work .
768374:46	It can be , yeah we had a stop for lunch , we had to have cups of tea , we had to go to ou , out the back and have a fag cos we ca n't smoke in the office .
768374:73	It can be , yeah we had a stop for lunch , we had to have cups of tea , we had to go to ou , out the back and have a fag cos we ca n't smoke in the office .
768375:18	Write all the things you have to do .
768386:42	actually it 's a bit boring down there now but they , they had to put my , my explanation of the price of petrol er down , there 's nowhere to thing , cos th the last time I was down there I asked for a pint of bitter and this guy bought it me and said and I wanted two pound thirty or something .
768387:38	And I said to him , do you know what they have to do a produce a gallon of petrol ?
768422:9	Well there has to be the odd one that 'll take over Peter .
768452:66	That 's not so you , how I perform , but how you can improve your contributions there , we might have to
768514:63	There 's , one of the things we will do before you leave tomorrow , is you will have to produce an action plan .
768544:82	of perhaps my characteristics cos I tend to go in to work at eight o' clock just before I write any more in and I do have to clear everything before I even start the day .
768617:48	Now , what you 've got to do , the one thing you really have got to do is to , is is to start being critical of yourselves and well look , am I doing anything wrong here ?
768809:173	Er , and I think what you need to do , what we all need to do is when we 've discussed all this stuff , talked about it , and I 'm sure you 'll talk about it again tonight , that what we need to do is to recognize that this has to start on Monday .
769114:23	Yeah , I think you 'll have to go round a bit .
769327:7	I must say I 'm ashamed .
769494:12	You do n't have to visit all those you did n't get
769554:188	I 'm saying is , is you ought to get very close to that geographical map because it 's the logistic logistics er difficulty with getting , and you ought to know where there are mountains and where there are valleys and the fact that that , in South Wales they ca n't just go across country , they have to go back down the valley after the M four and up again .
769555:93	Cos we 're driving lorries , we 're not driving little , you know trial bikes that go over mountains like the Brecons and stuff , you have to
769869:12	Yeah , that must definitely be right .
770102:9	But you must know what 's in it .
770151:59	Because it is subject to the conditions of carriage that we accept their business and therefore we have to provide them with written information .
770247:30	we tend to go back to feet I must say .
770479:19	Which means that so you have to make
770646:12	You do n't have to go in your own transport .
770923:28	I 've never worked where I 've had to get materials together and you know , sort things out .
770964:53	A friend of mine sends things like that and they gotta be and the proofs have to be sent .
771117:67	And that 's third party carriage forward which is even , and Peter 's even happier because he does n't even have to wait two days now , he gets his delivery next day .
771140:38	And if the shopkeeper uses our service all the time he does n't have to carry any stock .
771145:18	And if he does n't have to carry any stock what does that mean with th er in terms of his capital being tied up .
771204:13	Or if you have to have , I used to do it for erm West Bro , er Northampton Brewery .
771220:57	It is n't just service does n't end at the sale , so , a lot of things have to have after-care do n't they ?
771314:7	You have to insure them do n't you , carriage forward of course ?
771316:18	That 's why we have to
771397:11	but does it have to do got this
771428:92	inge , we 're our own which means that we are , our problems are so limited that we actually carry the liability ourselves , we do n't even have to use an external company to get the rates on .
771591:11	What he must do
771625:27	He 's gonna , he 's gonna have to pay for it .
771641:9	Would you have to send in a profile ?
771642:9	Do you have to send it in ?
771644:36	I 've never done it but I think you do have to send that in .
771789:14	And the others will have to wait till they come up again .
771807:34	And it does n't sound quite as clear as if you have to think about who you 're talking to .
771843:9	My , must be my mistake .
771928:81	Listening , as you become more comfortable and you become , you 've done it a few times you know what you 're gonna have to say and then you , you er , you listen more carefully to the answers .
772059:34	One feature maybe one or two benefits and you do n't have to tell them the whole story .
772064:10	You 'll have to come back on your selli , your course to do this .
772403:9	so you had to ask them .
772431:7	You have to open .
772503:38	feel like that and if you ask , if , they must say yes , no , because it , to engage , hang on th the phone rings , ring , ring , ring , ya , yes ?
772511:58	What happens if Well , oh sa , pwurgh , I do n't know , I mean she has to wait for a week .
772583:12	You do n't have to say we are a multi-national company with a hundred , in among hundred and ninety countries , we have a sales , a fleet of three thousand in this country , you do n't have to give them a list .
772583:118	You do n't have to say we are a multi-national company with a hundred , in among hundred and ninety countries , we have a sales , a fleet of three thousand in this country , you do n't have to give them a list .
772598:17	What other ways can you have to close a question , when you want , wanna get a green light ?
772603:31	Erm , shall we start , you might not even have to get the , shall we start it , the ball rolling then ?
772620:12	I 'm gonna have to let Carly have your go now ?
772697:24	We ca n't really stay , you have to come in in the morning .
772768:14	So you do n't have to .
772890:12	Well do n't have to be just .
772896:252	M I five operates it in Northern Ireland and has got this whole series you may well have seen the television programme recently about these people who work undercover and who work for the intelligence and they they work themselves into the I R A and become members and then they feed the information back to British it 's been very successful and a couple of insiders is risky and we eventually when they are discovered who these people are , they have to be given new identities , plastic surgery and the works .
772997:7	I have to remind you all , you that food and drink should be kept in the dining room , sounds reasonable enough .
773021:136	Er all of you , all of you prioritising some sort of organisation and planning of revision , so I 've got some ideas that you might want to try on that score so first years , I 'm sure like Clare you must have some work to do .
773029:11	Now I must ask you , I hope you do n't mind me recording this thing .
773142:177	So this business of of understanding how it happened from the , in inverted commas , victim 's point of view um this business of understanding the subsequent effects , this business of understanding the extent , ah are all enormously problematic and um it 's one of these things I would n't particularly like to have to design a survey of because it 's absolutely fraught with difficulty but nevertheless some some attempts have been made um as I have indicated .
773167:121	I 'm glad I 'm grown-up now actually because er y' know it 's one of my great pleasures in life to wake up in the mornings and think great I 'm grown-up , I do n't have to go to school and er and I do n't have to live with my parents and er things are much better now than they were say sort of y' know twenty years ago or so , er giving away my age there .
773167:153	I 'm glad I 'm grown-up now actually because er y' know it 's one of my great pleasures in life to wake up in the mornings and think great I 'm grown-up , I do n't have to go to school and er and I do n't have to live with my parents and er things are much better now than they were say sort of y' know twenty years ago or so , er giving away my age there .
773195:140	Um , it 's one of these things that erm y' know for some reason er the person they tell is apt to minimise the problem , is apt to say that the accusations are malicious , is apt to say that you must have imagined it and so on and so forth .
773201:136	Um also by that time er perhaps with a bit more experience of the world you 've got a bit more to compare it with and you 've got a strong sense that this is unjust , unreasonable and that other people do n't have to suffer from it .
773226:48	That is um when sexually transmitted diseases turned up in children , well it must be towels , it must be toilets , it must be clothes , bed linen erm , this is where the infection 's come from apparently .
773226:62	That is um when sexually transmitted diseases turned up in children , well it must be towels , it must be toilets , it must be clothes , bed linen erm , this is where the infection 's come from apparently .
773226:76	That is um when sexually transmitted diseases turned up in children , well it must be towels , it must be toilets , it must be clothes , bed linen erm , this is where the infection 's come from apparently .
773233:145	That 's erm moving along a little bit erm there 's also this business of of what I suppose in other contexts has been called blaming the victim , this business of children somehow inviting the the , if they have actually been abused , it must be because they 've invited it so erm that 's erm .
773314:116	Mhm yeah yeah but er well anyway if you get some stuff together and we 'll see we 'll see how it goes but er yeah so I think you 'll probably find you 'll have to work quite briskly erm
773362:7	I must I must have been I must have been on good form that day
773362:14	I must I must have been I must have been on good form that day
773362:28	I must I must have been I must have been on good form that day
773460:34	I wo n't be in on Monday so people will have to come in on Monday somebody will have to come in on Monday , go to the room specified which I have n't agreed yet and then put it on and then bring it back again to so people who ca n't make it today , that that 's the alternative arrangement but I 'll tell you more when I come back at eleven o' clock , okay ?
773460:61	I wo n't be in on Monday so people will have to come in on Monday somebody will have to come in on Monday , go to the room specified which I have n't agreed yet and then put it on and then bring it back again to so people who ca n't make it today , that that 's the alternative arrangement but I 'll tell you more when I come back at eleven o' clock , okay ?
773480:174	Um if you go back to the eighteenth century , early nineteenth century , you find that um I think it was at er Winchester possibly , er some some of you may have heard of this in in History or something , er there was an uprising at Winchester school and the Army had to be called in to quell the rioting pupils because they were rebelling against the harsh conditions .
773500:124	There is something wrong with the relationships , there is as well as somebody doing the abuse , there are other people who are somehow complicit in the abuse because they 're allowing it to go on , they must have known , surely they must have known , why did n't they do something ?
773500:143	There is something wrong with the relationships , there is as well as somebody doing the abuse , there are other people who are somehow complicit in the abuse because they 're allowing it to go on , they must have known , surely they must have known , why did n't they do something ?
773531:78	Particularly if there 's any suggestion that anything a bit like hypnosis has been used um this er business of of well it must be the therapist making them up or putting them up to it in some way becomes a particular argument that 's raised quite often .
773546:22	Councillor , I know and it must be really upsetting .
773582:187	Um going back to this business of people who 've been abused at er as part of , well not exactly abused , people who 've been severely bullied in in sc in the school system , erm particularly when you 're talking about all boys schools , I mean this is one of the problems that they have to contend with .
773599:138	Erm there was a big scandal about it and there was a report by um Butler Schloss which recommended , among other things , a whole range of safeguards and checks and balances of procedures so that this sort of , oh my God , this tragedy must n't happen in future .
773641:130	Like my father , when he was , when my mother first started going with him he used to smoke cigarettes quite hea heavily erm and er when he had a cold or something like that he 'd say , oh I must have a fag it helps me bring the phlegm up so erm in some ways they 're almost perceived as having a like a cur curative er
773684:13	Erm you may have to um , thinking about the capabilities of that computer there , you may have to um er split it up into er into say two sets of questions .
773684:59	Erm you may have to um , thinking about the capabilities of that computer there , you may have to um er split it up into er into say two sets of questions .
773688:67	So erm so give it a go anyway and see what happens erm and it 's no great hardship to have to y' know kind of do it in two or more sets I would n't have thought y' know it 'll it 'll probably still work .
773778:30	Many companies when needing to finance new projects have to raise more capital .
773780:39	But if those forms of capital are n't available then the business has to raise capital by some other means and this is very often done by liquidated assets that they currently hold and releasing the capital for the new project .
773788:7	We must sell some of our houses and use the money we gain from that to fund the provision of new housing in the City .
773816:148	There will be occasions where indeed if people ar people in marginal circumstances are encouraged to buy then we will find , as the local authorities , that they will not be able to raise a mortgage in in in the private sector and we will actually have to supply the mortgage ourselves so where 's the capital receipt gone ?
773818:16	Because we we 've had to provide mortgage .
773854:7	You have to y y y you have to promote the product to make people buy it .
773854:28	You have to y y y you have to promote the product to make people buy it .
773856:14	Of course people must be advised carefully but it shows great lack of faith in human na in their abilities and a great arrogance on our part Mr Mayor if we fail to market the ideas simply because we do n't feel the populus are competent to understand it .
773861:114	But to present the full scenario and then vote er on the the different items er so that voting is done on items on the amendment before we then proceed er if you want to we just have to go to amendments to that because of course no two amendments can be on the floor at the same time .
773880:141	However , it is that means that over the last few years every time we have actually debated about budget we recognised that the force had unwillingly and against the judgement of the majority of this council , not necessarily er bounded by political affiliation , we have to be getting down further and further towards the completely inaccurate expanded spending assessment that is assessed as necessary for the needs of this city by the department of the environment .
773896:139	This is in line with the obvious policy , not just of the ruling group , but I suspect of the council as a whole that we know that sooner or later courtesy of this government , whether we like it or not we are going to have to get down to our standard spending assessment .
773906:100	We may not want it but the government is going to demand it and we as custodians of the services on the part of the people of Cambridge , are going to have to do as sensibly and sensitively as possible .
773924:18	In the end there has to be a limit , there has to be a level beyond which you cannot go without people cracking under the strain , without people saying I 'm now doing the job that was done by two people , two and half people a few years ago .
773924:38	In the end there has to be a limit , there has to be a level beyond which you cannot go without people cracking under the strain , without people saying I 'm now doing the job that was done by two people , two and half people a few years ago .
773942:11	Yes we have to operate within our resources , but if we 're looking to er how recycling that seems to us a bid which is worthy of backing regardless of political affiliation .
773998:17	And a question you have to ask yourself is why the labour party is prepared to spend on all the aspects of county council responsibility except education .
774032:31	Because I do recognise Mr Mayor er I have to say , that this amendment is a step in the right direction .
774042:96	I also pressed at the city board for something to be done about this problem of the er people disappearing off the poll tax register at an alarming rate I must add .
774044:68	I find found that absolutely incredible and I thought it was bizarre to say the least , the procedure we had to go through the other er evening erm with two hours of acrimonious debate er a break while you consulted er the officers before we got to some er sensible way forward which is now incorporated in this amendment er to spend a hundred thousand pounds on actually trying to trace .
774047:63	So you 're doing exactly what we were telling you to do a few weeks ago , that you had to er take money out of reserves or you had to cut down on the level of services if you were to avoid putting that thirty four pounds on the council tax bills this year .
774047:97	So you 're doing exactly what we were telling you to do a few weeks ago , that you had to er take money out of reserves or you had to cut down on the level of services if you were to avoid putting that thirty four pounds on the council tax bills this year .
774049:181	There are some things in this that obviously we can support , the delete or reduction in the contingency pros p provision to a hundred thousand pounds , we 're going to be moving later on to delete even that amount but it 's surprising you were telling us you 've been telling us for years you have to have two hundred thousand pounds in the contingency .
774060:195	And obviously we would want to take money out of reserves , our original amendment took one point three million pounds out of reserves and it 's interesting to see now that you 're suggesting almost that figure again and yet for years you 've been telling us you ca n't take this money out of the reserves , er you know we had to keep it for a rainy day .
774084:72	Even president Clinton is learning that , even as a democrat he had a reputation of fiscal responsibility as a government , but I must admit I welcomed his present er proposals in that regard .
774089:53	They 're also , Mr Mayor , interestingly coming out in favour of the individual but I must admit I applaud that and at long last in some , admittedly very modest way , er they are moving , I wo n't say to fiscal responsibility , but at least they 're learning the lessons of the recklessness of the past of their policies .
774090:14	But what we have to bear in mind of course er the f financial propriety of this council would in a sense have been very easy over the years if the labour party previously had trimmed its budget according to what we could all afford .
774094:10	Again I must say it seems extraordinary does n't it that er he pontificates the savings when really one is entitled to ask the question well why were n't they made before ?
774106:40	What I actually said was that the price that we would have to charge for burying the dead had to go up in order to ensure that in of the circumstances our standards could remain impeccable .
774106:66	What I actually said was that the price that we would have to charge for burying the dead had to go up in order to ensure that in of the circumstances our standards could remain impeccable .
774142:69	It 's not been without pain and I pay tribute to our staff 's willingness to embrace the changes that we 've had to make .
774169:10	It also has to hinder to recognition of what the needs of the people of the city are and I actually cast out , wipe out services and the needs of central administration which is essential to any council and I would hope that not only my own back this amendment .
774190:13	All three elements have to come in to any budget decision and nobody can ignore all three , indeed if you look around three groups of the council you 'll see that all the budget proposed tonight will take into account all three areas .
774204:59	It would have revenue effect of course in ninety four , ninety five and our future budget will have to reflect that .
774209:34	And of course in a scheme like that many details have to be worked out especially in negotiations with the bus company for the figure we have put in is I think a realistic figure for the first year of the scheme .
774214:15	These services of course have to be paid for and we do aim to keep the level of taxation as low as possible but of course we ca n't aim to bring it down as far as conservatives would want because we need , we in the city need , to spend money on things like the education fund without which it becomes a city less worth living in .
774286:234	Erm , I think Yeltsin 's threat as it were to the Ukrainian is actually a diplomatic move , he wants Ukraine to remain within the Soviet Union , er and if it does so he 's not going to make an issue of the border , but , er , if it does break away completely I think what he 's saying is well there 's a frontier that we 're going to have to reconsider because large Eastern areas of Ukraine including huge industrial towns are predominantly populated by Russians .
774298:26	Er the former Soviet Republics are going to have to decide what kind of defensive alliance they want among themselves .
774299:132	Ukraine for example is already stated in its er declaration of Sovereignty that it regards itself as a non nuclear zone , so they 're not going to want nuclear weapons for themselves , and er , I imagine that the former republics will have to quite a a comprehensive military alliance perhaps on the lines of NATO and that nuclear weapons will be vested in that alliance .
774301:40	That 's how I see things evolving , er but it must be said that Russian statesmen have got to have this self restraint not to abuse those nuclear weapons just as the United States has had to .
774301:58	That 's how I see things evolving , er but it must be said that Russian statesmen have got to have this self restraint not to abuse those nuclear weapons just as the United States has had to .
774301:114	That 's how I see things evolving , er but it must be said that Russian statesmen have got to have this self restraint not to abuse those nuclear weapons just as the United States has had to .
774348:7	I must say Professor Hoskin I was rather struck by pictures in the papers today , yesterday of Boris Yeltsin standing over a boar he 'd shot , it was strongly reminiscent of pictures we 've seen of the former president of Romania , Ceausescu .
774349:26	Right and indeed , er I , I must er correct the impression that Yeltsin is anti-semitic , I do n't think there 's any evidence of that at all , er , a and , er I , I would regard that really as a slander on his character , but er , er Russian nationalist , this is a very delicate question .
774370:9	Any nation has to learn democracy er , and it seems to me that all the people of the Soviet Union have shown over the last four or five years a lively interest in politics and considerable to participate in politics , er one of the problems is of course is that they 've been doing so , too much and in too disorganised a way , they 're going to have to get together .
774370:210	Any nation has to learn democracy er , and it seems to me that all the people of the Soviet Union have shown over the last four or five years a lively interest in politics and considerable to participate in politics , er one of the problems is of course is that they 've been doing so , too much and in too disorganised a way , they 're going to have to get together .
774376:55	I certainly do n't , because erm , according to this policy the first thing the Russian people have got to put up with is a high level of unemployment .
774414:32	I would have thought they 've simply , it had to be agreed that that was stopped and then as the professor has said , I mean we give all the aid we can to turn their erm military er industry into erm , what was it , instead of guns .
774424:36	Let me , let me interrupt you here , I must support Saddam Hussein , I do n't believe he carried his own policies , I 'm concerned about the Iraqi people themselves .
774445:133	It 's certainly something we 're all gonna have too er adjust too , thank you for pointing it out that the United States is going to have such enormous influence er from , from now on , we 're all going to have to get used to it and er get used to how to deal with it .
774449:7	There must be many , many able Russians who take the same line as the only way forward could be incorporated in a democratic Russia and very , very substantially contribute to its recovery .
774466:34	Therefore it seems to me that the communist party really has to disappear , it 's a good thing that it 's own general secretary has disbanded it , I anticipate that it will break up into a number of political parties , perhaps one kind of social democratic party on the left and another , if you like a kind of Russian unionist party , on the right , erm , but as the communist party it 's simply incompatible with the emergence of democracy in the Soviet Union .
774500:12	We do n't have to worry as much as we used to about its being misused by the party state apparatus for corrupt erm , then of course there 's , them , the , the , the problem of longer term aid , how we help the Soviet Union integrate itself into the world economy .
774540:50	Slipped out of the hand quite obviously that , it was n't a deliberate beamer we must add that , that 's went out today , thirty-four , here 's Lawrence , bowls outside the off stump and the new batsman who is not yet off the mark , lets it go through to the wicket keeper .
774545:18	But , Tufnell of course must have precedence there at the moment .
774547:164	Here 's Lawrence , bowls and that 's a full length again , but it 's down the leg side , glances it very delicately , it 's a good throw from Tufnell , well a quick throw from Tufnell , it lands in the middle of the pitch in actual fact , but they have to hurry for the two runs now , one hundred and eighteen for three wickets now and is six , DaSilva eighteen .
774568:63	Things he keeps , erm , little barrels , he keeps er number of balls , he 's had to put two pound coins in his pocket instead , and I think that 's put him off , anyhow he got it right .
774578:76	A hundred and eighteen for three and the asking rate of the start of the day was er three point six two over , it must have deteriorated from the point of Sri Lanka .
774614:66	And when someone goes out , erm , playing a little hesitantly , you ca n't , you know , you have to give the , the England team credit for , for posing some unusual problems .
774615:205	It 's , I mean he played very well DaSilva I think , but in a completely different mode to the first innings , he was purely set on trying to save the game , trying to battle with , I think he did n't bowl very well , had n't bowled very many short balls in the day and that was perhaps the first one he 's had to receive and er he was caught in two minds really .
774618:78	Well I do n't know , but it , it is a long way down , people who do n't know Lord 's , you have to come down from , er and er perhaps they 're not quite ready , but it is there must have taken , I do n't , next time perhaps put the clock on it , but this must be a three minute or three and a half minute .
774618:136	Well I do n't know , but it , it is a long way down , people who do n't know Lord 's , you have to come down from , er and er perhaps they 're not quite ready , but it is there must have taken , I do n't , next time perhaps put the clock on it , but this must be a three minute or three and a half minute .
774618:190	Well I do n't know , but it , it is a long way down , people who do n't know Lord 's , you have to come down from , er and er perhaps they 're not quite ready , but it is there must have taken , I do n't , next time perhaps put the clock on it , but this must be a three minute or three and a half minute .
774626:27	, and I , I , think we must assume , that , that , he was no ball because he was a beamer and not because of front foot .
774628:33	Yeah , but he does n't have , he does n't have to be noted in the score book , that he was no balled for a , for a beamer , but out of interest perhaps he was letting him er , so Giles there , there , left-hander , played some lovely strokes in the first innings , was n't in for long , then Shaw goes down on his knees there up and outside the old stump , he 's playing backwards , the ball goes through to Russell .
774634:129	No , I mean , England have bowled much better at him and Tufnell 's for example is , is very difficult to get away because it is spinning a little bit and I 'm sure that they , the England bowlers must have said to themselves , we 're not going to bowl a lot of short balls at , at we must keep it full length , erm , and so part of this slow score is due to better England bowling .
774634:190	No , I mean , England have bowled much better at him and Tufnell 's for example is , is very difficult to get away because it is spinning a little bit and I 'm sure that they , the England bowlers must have said to themselves , we 're not going to bowl a lot of short balls at , at we must keep it full length , erm , and so part of this slow score is due to better England bowling .
774709:55	Certainly felt if Sri Lanka had any chance at all of knocking off these runs , they had to score big hundreds .
774738:73	on nine , facing Tufnell , digs out a full-length ball and guides it down on the off side , poor old David Lawrence has to give another painful chase their from backward point , but er , he lumbers after it and sends it an energetic return on the er , he 's swivelling round as he threw it .
774752:79	Conscious of a ball not carrying through all the time to Jack Russell and while a slash or a drive will go very fast to them , have to be sure that the ball is going to carry .
774767:22	He looks right David Lawrence I must say and that was a very , very quick delivery and getting back to your other point , that slips coming forward going back , it 's just every now and again that it does n't come out right from David Lawrence , it goes down comparatively slowly , but when he does get it right , it really flies through to slips .
774819:166	The other occasion that we looked that , er a week or so back when he called down Zaccheus , from that tree in which he was hiding last week his judge , Pilate but of all of those interviews and th the many others that we have n't looked at , this surely must one of the strangest , as Jesus himself is in the process of dying and as he is dying he is confronted with another person who has a need .
774829:17	And this surely then , must be one of the most strange and one of the most wonderful interviews that our Lord ever had when he was here on earth with this dying thief .
774865:204	And the Je , the Philippine jailer , he cries out a question which , I 'm sure he does n't even know what he means when he calls it out , he 's not thinking of heaven , he 's not thinking of the future life , he 's not thinking of having his sins dealt with , but he just cries out , what must I do to be saved ?
774876:56	He was simply saved by asking the Lord to save him , that 's all he had to do .
774893:78	I remember , when I was doing my lifesaving certificates , that one of the very first things that we learnt , was that you have to , as the life sa , the life saver , you had to be in charge of the situation .
774893:115	I remember , when I was doing my lifesaving certificates , that one of the very first things that we learnt , was that you have to , as the life sa , the life saver , you had to be in charge of the situation .
774898:53	And some , as it meant , if that , if they had done that you actually have to put your foot in their sto , chest , or their stomach and push them away from you , and swim around and come at them from the back .
774899:11	Because you had to do the rescuing .
774902:7	He has got to do the rescuing .
774948:45	And salvation is not a long drawn out affair it 's not something we have to go through all sorts of processes to to se , to finally achieve it , it 's there as God 's free gift waiting to be received .
774966:108	If we have come to him and received him as our saviour then if we are gonna live na in , if we are not gonna live in a state of disobedience then we have got to be baptized whether we choose to , whether we like to it 's a , it 's a simple thing , it 's not a matter of choice it 's the straightforward command of the Lord 's .
775096:9	And you have to start questioning .
775254:35	Let me read you two or three verses the bible has to say about blessing , first of all , the verse in the book of Proverbs Proverbs chapter ten , verse twenty two .
775281:26	Well let 's see what God himself has to say cos he gives us a definition of blessing .
775326:20	A man concerning whom Pilate has to pronounce a verdict .
775332:7	He has got to take the next action , it 's up to him now .
775348:156	It 's not just an event in history two thousand years ago , something that happened way back i in a back water of the Roman empire , that 's not the really important issue for you and for me today it 's , the important thing is that you and I have to stand in that same place that Pilate stood and we have to make that same decision , what will I do then with Jesus that is called the Christ ?
775348:192	It 's not just an event in history two thousand years ago , something that happened way back i in a back water of the Roman empire , that 's not the really important issue for you and for me today it 's , the important thing is that you and I have to stand in that same place that Pilate stood and we have to make that same decision , what will I do then with Jesus that is called the Christ ?
775349:21	That is the decision you have to face up to , that 's the decision I have to face up to .
775349:57	That is the decision you have to face up to , that 's the decision I have to face up to .
775351:57	We may be able to put it off for a while , but make that decision , we have got to , some day or another .
775359:33	But that is the decision every one of us has to make , and that is the real significance of this scene here in Jerusalem .
775364:28	There were that tremendous sense in which Jesus had to die .
775458:7	You must do something with Jesus .
775582:7	I have to confess , for what it 's worth , I do not really like Lewis Carroll , Alice through the Looking Glass , and Alice in Wonderland , they bore me stiff !
775590:57	I can believe God will do this , therefore , because I believe it , then God has got to do it !
775620:15	Because what they had to believe for was not a miracle !
775638:25	But in a sense you do n't actually have to ask to have faith because God 's already given it to you .
775689:198	Now God loves the world , he sent Jesus to die for the world , Jesus came , he lived a sinless life , he gave his life on the cross of Calvary , he died there for my sins they were put on him , the whole story of salvation but , salvation in it 's totality is God 's gift , I do not have to merit it .
775695:28	You see , the very faith that we have to receive God 's gift , is God 's gift to us .
775703:61	All the , the unlimitable supply of God 's grace could not save you or me by itself it had to have the other side , it had to have faith , I have to receive it .
775703:84	All the , the unlimitable supply of God 's grace could not save you or me by itself it had to have the other side , it had to have faith , I have to receive it .
775703:101	All the , the unlimitable supply of God 's grace could not save you or me by itself it had to have the other side , it had to have faith , I have to receive it .
775722:9	The two have got to go together .
775734:11	Because they had to exercise a bit of faith .
775735:7	They had to go and possess it .
775745:19	That 's all they had to do .
775747:9	And they had to go in a do some fighting .
775748:7	They had to defeat the enemy .
775787:17	You see our faith must make experiential , what God 's grace has made possible .
775817:43	I do n't know , if you 're like me but , I must confess , I I get er , I would n't say pleasure , but I rather like those incidents where he tells the disciples off , not because he 's telling them off , but because I can fit in wi with what they 've been up to !
775833:29	Even if we 're not gonna succeed it must have stuck in their throat that there was Jesus lying asleep .
775891:11	and you have to back track all the way and work out so integration 's very very similar now
775937:50	a lot of people would think , Ah oh X to the sixth well he must have started of with X to the seventh .
775982:88	Ah you do n't want to finish up with minus sine X you want to finish up with sine X so what are you going to have to start off with ?
775996:16	Well for starters you have to have minus sine for the coses now the square would be erm cubed over three .
776185:48	Someone 's telling you the answers and you 're thinking , Well okay it must be right knows what he 's doing he 's a teacher right okay I 'll put it down .
776317:23	So you 'd say well we must have let let 's say that I was n't being that helpful
776373:9	So what must we have started out with .
776382:47	just finished up with four X cubed minus X times its differential so what must we have started off we differentiated something and it was very very close to this very
776399:103	Now if we 'd have started off four X cubed minus X all squared we would have two times this lot but we did n't we just got once this so we must have started off this is only a coefficient only a a factor .
776401:7	What must we have started off with here to finish up with with that ?
776407:21	you 'd think well he must have Integrate X squared .
776408:22	you 'd say , Well he must have started off with X cubed .
776412:32	no good it 's three times too much so he must have started off with X cubed over three and that would 've given us one third of three X squared
776417:10	You 'd have to take that from a half .
776418:10	You 'd have to take a half of it .
776440:9	right we must have had four X cubed minus X in brackets
776510:13	into anything it must come from something .
776524:42	So they were playing with each others models , No that bit has to go there
776787:9	so it must have been a third X cubed
776980:12	when you have to watch out for the differences
777297:17	Erm you do n't have to exactly understand the tools that you 're using and how they work but
777299:10	you do have to understand their limitations .
777432:23	or X or anything else we might have to call it .
777730:15	You did n't actually have to come down er with er to the station to .
777805:132	In those days there was n't a great deal of of mining , I mean was n't open , and er there was a tremendous amount , well there 's a fair amount of of traffic agricultural traffic , and I mean one had to accept that virtually everything came in , all coal , road stone , erm goods required er for well ' s who were going at the time , they er they used the railway .
777914:15	Still I 'm must n't get too political must I .
777914:27	Still I 'm must n't get too political must I .
778007:36	To so it could accommodate more coal , erm and not have to return to base so frequently .
778215:135	Erm and er so trains could er instead of going towards Lincoln having to perhaps back up to , they would go round er a triangle basically , and be facing towards , equally if they 're coming back , they did n't have to go towards Lincoln , and then back , they could erm could erm go round and er take their wares to sidings and marshalling yards .
778239:35	Erm I remember er thinking one day , erm I must get a photograph of that er building which was clearly a erm er a coal office or similar , I 'll go back at the weekend and get that .
778334:10	We 'll have to look into it to see if we ca n't manage it .
778347:28	Erm , then after that we 'll have to look at the floor , but there 's no point in doing the floor until the decorating is done is there ? and the roof sorted out .
778370:29	You see , I think our next priority must be that bit out there , where we , where we 've got no damp course . .
778377:9	The roof has got to be done has n't it ?
778416:28	They 're working ever so hard and I must say they were good , you know , erm , cos they have n't finished the job yet , but erm , I think they know what there about you know , and they 've certainly got a lot of energy and it 's a hard job . .
778422:21	Well I think we 'll have to get some other quotes , because Peter is n't the the roofer , he gets someone else to do it , so I think we ought to have some other quotes .
778485:36	Well I 'll ask at the meeting , but I 'll have to talk about it .
778532:32	This is particularly true in this area where we have to compete with the Townswomen 's Guild which has a lower subscription and also with numerous Council-run activities , many of which are free or at a low cost for pensioners .
778534:10	We therefore have to ask our members to contribute to the upkeep by way of fund-raising activities and this increases their spending on the Institute by many pounds per annum .
778545:88	We apologise for the outspokenness of this letter , but it is felt that if we are to continue as a national organisation of good standing , we must put our house in order before it is too late .
778551:33	I have n't sent it because I thought I must read it to the meeting .
778567:118	There were various factors to be taken into account when determining the actual amount , previously the subscription adding and the fact that there had been no increase in the second year when inflation in increased considerably had to be taken into account .
778569:46	In other words for every three pounds , thirty membership fee , the National Federation it has to pay just over a forty nine pence to Customs and Excise .
778576:11	The National Federation had to consider all the points when determining the amounts of the new subscription to having raise various figures finally agreed on the amount of nine pounds .
778621:12	It , it must 've cost a fortune , because er extra because of all the hotel accommodation we had to have as well .
778621:54	It , it must 've cost a fortune , because er extra because of all the hotel accommodation we had to have as well .
778629:10	It would have to be done in .
778654:33	You see , I do n't see why we have to have London and they bought the blessed place .
778667:9	No it must be er an accountant .
778682:9	Only we must do that fairly soon .
778687:22	Yes , that , I 'll have to sign that .
778691:154	It 's alright , only if you can let , all of you that have expenses , can you let me have them by next Wednesday and erm , I will , I can pay you out then at the meeting and erm , because you know , everything has to be in erm by the end of this month .
778779:34	If they do n't go then our diaries and calendars will have to be .
778781:65	Erm , there 's a nomination for , for the executive committee nineteen ninety two to nineteen ninety four , erm , this must be back to the County by the twenty second September , nomination for the executive committee and up to twelve members may be nominated .
778812:13	We 'll just have to wait and see for .
778813:36	Well say , say that erm , oh do you have to say ?
778889:10	Well we have to take a chance .
778901:23	Go off and we 'd just have to bear the costs .
778928:29	Sixty eight pounds and then ten classes and then you have to pay two pounds student 's fee .
778937:13	Why do you have to pay , it is a for students ' union , if , if , if you 're in work you do n't have to belong to a union ?
778937:83	Why do you have to pay , it is a for students ' union , if , if , if you 're in work you do n't have to belong to a union ?
778950:80	Essex News , I really have n't had time to look through it erm , but there 's rather a nice little bit which I must read .
778958:9	So I must read that after the meeting .
778992:24	Yes , but they , you would n't have to pay twelve pounds per person just for a talk .
779005:51	And she passed with flying colours She 's been driving for years apparently but she had to take a test .
779009:39	I 've got a little bit here going from Mr he had to come in again and see to two lights and he 'd only take two pounds and that included the light bulb , but I paid him so that comes out of the .
779037:12	He did n't have to put new piping in did he , I understand , it 's an awful lot of money .
779044:15	No , but it must be time consuming , yeah , course .
779076:11	All this money has to be paid in .
779093:67	I 've got it , I 'm only going by what Betty wrote little things in erm this book that has to be done .
779137:35	I said I had no objections , but I would have to ask , you know , the committee if they had because she 's not a member as such , but obviously has been going on all the year .
779248:19	Oh , so we would n't have to pay the postage .
779251:34	Hm , I think we said last time that they had to tell you this month with the money .
779456:12	Erm tickets will have to be on sale from October you see .
779484:77	Well I 'll ring her up tonight as well and find out if it 's , if it 's gone up exorbitantly , I 'll have to ring round , ring you and see what to do .
779493:46	No that would be fine , I mean , whoever 's president will have to bear that in mind wo n't they ? .
779499:15	I said you must be a member to handle money . .
779563:78	Well I 'll , I 'll try and get down on Monday and see what she says and I say you know she must do three hours on Mondays .
779564:7	What must she do , what is it five hours a week ?
779566:7	She must do five hours a week .
779592:80	Yes , yeah , cos now , that , see she 's not here really for , for me to come and pay her so I have to take the money down to her house now .
779601:10	You 'll have to come down early .
779602:40	Yes , well if I ca n't find her , I will have to ring her up and say what hours is she doing here ? and I think that will be a way of finding out , but I 'm not coming before nine and if she 's not here at nine I will want to know why , what time she 's started . .
779619:49	Erm , so this is what I 've been trying to avoid , I must be honest about it .
779724:49	Anne was expressing concern yesterday that sh you know , she does n't want to have to you know , a syllabus .
779742:12	But you 'd have to do them yourself .
779869:15	in the room we must give it
780293:12	It does n't have to be draughts or anything .
780519:11	if I have to go and do the music I , jolly well wanna do it !
780564:29	Er , through for instance , spontaneous people involvement must be catered for .
780844:28	We 're also running erm without , we must be running without or we 've got a significantly reduced level of chase-ups because our turn- rounds are , in most areas , are significantly better than they were .
780874:66	But it , well what it will do is it will actually mean that you have n't , should n't have to worry so much about keeping logs of what you 've sent round and , and so on .
780878:35	Cos if it is , how much are we gonna have to pay for it , and why and what can we do to try and bring it back in .
780912:15	I think it must be easy to plan must n't it if you know you 've got that top number of hours from looking at what you 've got
780912:32	I think it must be easy to plan must n't it if you know you 've got that top number of hours from looking at what you 've got
780927:21	Is there certain work there that has to be done during the week and ca n't wait till the weekend ?
780947:16	And then we 'll have to deal with that other one and er and , and resolve that one way or the other and make , make sure we 've done that reasonably reasonably quickly , either g sending her back to new business or er trying to find another position for her if she ca n't actually cope with that .
780949:29	Erm the J C one we 'll have to try and deal with that again as a separate issue but I do n't , I mean the amount of time we 're losing from high levels of sickness we talked about a c couple of meetings or so ago , about the absence levels with some people , we 've just gotta make sure we crack that on the head , we 're just haemorrhaging money , the fact that it is not just hours it 's money .
780951:62	Yeah there 's no reason why you ca n't ask Trudy for an update now , you do n't have to wait for Tr for Trudy 's report .
780972:9	But we have to keep in mind that we 're not gonna let service levels deteriorate so
780975:16	And that 's gonna have to be some of the things that suffer .
780976:155	If for example you 've got a problem with productivity in your patch , erm because of the , the reasons we 've talked about , it does mean that perhaps you need to say to whoever has been , is off and doing other projects that they 'll have to stop doing that until you 've got the productivity up till you can release them back again .
780977:18	I think they 'll have to recognize that it 's gonna be roll your sleeves up and we 're go we are n't gonna be able to do all of the things we wanted to do , and that 's the price we 're gonna have to pay .
780977:148	I think they 'll have to recognize that it 's gonna be roll your sleeves up and we 're go we are n't gonna be able to do all of the things we wanted to do , and that 's the price we 're gonna have to pay .
781175:27	So er and they 're very bullish I have to say , very bullish about the way things are going .
781192:52	So I said erm if we say increase to five pounds now , they do n't have to , but it means that they 'll probably have a significant unit holding , you know , to compensate them .
781298:36	Th th those plans are designed such that all the premiums have to be paid .
781331:18	Well you 're answer must be twenty two hundred thousand
781378:15	I think we have to do a note , a letter , of some sort .
781444:20	No the , the amount due has to equal the amount paid
781475:15	And each team 'll have to do a hundred
781477:32	It 's a hundred a week they 'll have to do , per team .
781524:59	because if anybody 's got a query , well like well when was it paid somebody 's gonna have to look up and scroll back and
781540:38	The arrears is n't , no , they 'd , you 'd have to go in and
781582:59	It 's like the same issue we talked about the three year plan projects if necessary we 'll have to slow down on some of the projects , certainly to get through this budget year intact .
781598:19	And then what we 'll have to do , th the unit statement 's perfectly okay , the benefit statement all you 've got to do is get the benefit statement retyped but with a different premium in at renewal date .
781599:11	So the teams have got to do that have they ?
781607:90	Well cos , for the sake of ten days there er er er erm Martin was gonna fix the problem , erm within ten days but we do n't wanna have to go back and reprint everything cos the unit statement 's perfectly valid .
781641:7	I had to use it for one of Andy
781643:34	yeah one of Andy 's cases this morning I had to do it where it had growth old cash on it , which it should n't have had so it was quite handy .
781683:165	Erm the other thing was that the people at senior level need to be reminded , if they do have a major problem erm that 's David and Malcolm , erm where , if they 've got a rather difficult case and it 's urgent and they want a , they do n't wanna have to put it on a , on a fax , they want , they need it there and then erm , and they do n't like the telephone call facility , I said well , well that 's primarily for consultants .
781762:19	what the hell does he have to do with it ?
781773:13	We wo n't have to pay for it will we ?
781775:21	No I think we 'll have to charge something .
781964:10	Okay you have to get the point just on
782041:9	Does it have to be a exact amount
782061:27	So you 've got to , you 'll have to change something wo n't you ?
782116:9	So that must be the hundred and that must be the eighty .
782116:27	So that must be the hundred and that must be the eighty .
782219:12	So it would have to start
782260:14	Oh well you do have to stay out there sorry .
782317:59	So she 's spending a third on stationery , she 's saving a third and the other third has got to be split up between
782394:30	Well try and explain it , you do n't have to get the right words .
782661:21	So a tenth of three sixty must be ?
782890:95	You should have this one twenty left over so just check that and make sure that you have cos if you have n't something 's gone wrong and you have to start again but you
782912:54	Well why , why w it 's just half okay so that was easy you did n't have to work out how many degrees , it was just a half , it 's half way round the circle .
782939:10	You 'd have to find
783165:17	Carol Vorderman where you have to make numbers ?
783166:7	You have to make a total out of the numbers ?
783193:15	So you 're gonna have to think of another way .
783204:69	But if it ended in , if ten is one of its factors then there 's a num another number that must be one of its factors .
783206:7	Five must be a factor and two must be a factor .
783206:27	Five must be a factor and two must be a factor .
783262:51	Four times ninety , so a fourth of the way round , a quarter the way round must be ?
783373:51	Yes if she 's coming out you mean you do n't , you do n't have to do it all tonight she wan might want to be talking about erm her grading a lot so you ca n't expect her to do any work until she 's got that out of her system she might want to go on for an hour or so .
783445:49	I , I , I mean I do think that w what we would have to do is , is if people started making inroads into two via this route , it might mean then we 'd get to the point where it was n't going to cost that much more to enable other scale one people
783512:13	Yeah you 'd have to work for Deborah then
783514:10	You 'd have to work for Deborah you 'd love that .
783516:12	You do n't have to work with Deborah
783540:42	And er Alan keeps saying , you can do it but you have to wait to the next programme coming through and I specifically asked for Liz to put it on .
783575:9	Cos we have to
783682:12	But I might have to cancel it on what , what Deborah 's said .
783700:9	no we had to do it
783975:126	So when we went through it , Kevin was going to do all of the careers officers in York but did n't need to do Mary because she 's part of the adult team and therefore Jane and Julie will have to sort her .
783978:9	Would n't have to do Norma because she 's a probationer , would n't have to do Denise .
783978:46	Would n't have to do Norma because she 's a probationer , would n't have to do Denise .
783989:12	We do n't have to mention names .
783991:14	No you do n't have to I 've seen them .
784040:15	I mean there must
784081:54	which was n't an unreasonable sort of target , erm we would get through everybody we had to get through in a year .
784115:13	form you had to , that you had to
784115:29	form you had to , that you had to
784240:42	I mean we have no choice really , some of these things have to happen , you know it has to be done ,
784240:66	I mean we have no choice really , some of these things have to happen , you know it has to be done ,
784311:115	and you sort of say , do you think it would be useful if we talked about reception because that 's something y you 're not doing quite as frequently but it 's obviously , it must be difficult for you to fit in to that because you 're not doing it all the time .
784319:16	I think she has to be one of the easiest ones to do ,
784335:74	I mean that was really valuable to understand that , cos Ian thought oh yeah that 's something that we really have to address you know
784368:20	But you know that you have to , you know you ca n't just
784370:21	ignore it and that you have to work on it and you have to
784370:43	ignore it and that you have to work on it and you have to
784396:9	when have to do it , yeah .
784397:12	when you have to do it .
784414:9	Cos you have to negotiate
784416:24	Or just a colleague it does n't have to be someone that 's m just
784444:9	Wh it must have been hard ?
784508:12	I 'm gonna have to do it
784510:12	I 'm gonna have to do it .
784556:12	Yeah So I must admit
784558:7	I must admit that was quite good cos she 'd got Liz who was
784636:13	even if you have to say to them , well I 'm
784841:8	it must , she gets a lot of demand does n't she really ?
784889:60	The only trouble is when you 're doing your administration and some days you know y you may have to really get stuck in
784942:74	The , the , the anomaly here this is when they set up the C C T legislation , all the services contracted out had to make a of return that 's a profit in any language and that to me is a commercial decision and should never have been exempted from the very start anyway .
784954:27	The union itself , the members will also have to do something about this as well .
784981:29	The , the Tories claim that that local authorities must be more competitive than the market place .
784988:14	The G M B must continue to argue at every at , at every level locally , regionally and nationally to ensure that our members are properly trained to meet the challenges that lie ahead .
785014:12	We should n't have to compete with anyone .
785044:49	To show how safe services are in the hands of this government , you only have to study John Major 's speech to the Society of County Treasurers at his Annual Dinner in London last December and I quote , together we have achieved much over the last decade to improve the services we provide for the people we serve and the environment in which they live , unquote .
785057:78	Conference , I ask you , with that response what does that hold for our social services within our communities and how hopelessly helpless we must feel that given we will certainly not ?
785091:86	There 's an old saying do n't get mad , get even , and the only way we 're gonna get even with this government and we have to learn a lesson from history , is to do to this government what unfortunately we had to do in nineteen seventy nine and if any government deserve to be taken on , then it 's this Tory government .
785091:140	There 's an old saying do n't get mad , get even , and the only way we 're gonna get even with this government and we have to learn a lesson from history , is to do to this government what unfortunately we had to do in nineteen seventy nine and if any government deserve to be taken on , then it 's this Tory government .
785110:85	The first step taken by Tylers was to impose substantially reduced terms and conditions , the next step was to tell G M B members that they must work as many hours as necessary to complete their refuse tasks .
785119:38	A victory for the G M B is essential , Tylers must be defeated .
785120:13	A Labour Council must get off the fence sack Tylers
785246:90	It has n't all been smooth running of course , I mean working in a parliament with eighty separate national political delegations , working in t nine languages , I have to admit we 've made the odd slip .
785298:127	The Commissioner has already made it clear that if it needs to bring its works council proposal on where the consultation and multi-nationals through the new Chapter , it 'll include workers in British plants and calculating which firms have to comply and U K firms operating plants on the continent will have to operate the directive there .
785298:162	The Commissioner has already made it clear that if it needs to bring its works council proposal on where the consultation and multi-nationals through the new Chapter , it 'll include workers in British plants and calculating which firms have to comply and U K firms operating plants on the continent will have to operate the directive there .
785310:7	We must defeat that fear of desperation and hopelessness , especially among the young .
785311:7	We must reject absolutely a Europe where your freedom of movement will depend on the colour of your skin .
785323:78	Colleagues , if we believe in playing the full part in the European community then as Steven Hughes has just said we as a union must back the Maastricht Treaty .
785338:20	What this , this union must do and what Labour must do is campaign for the earliest possible opt-in to the Social Chapter .
785338:36	What this , this union must do and what Labour must do is campaign for the earliest possible opt-in to the Social Chapter .
785342:21	This is a battle which must be fought and won by the trade union movement now in post-Maastricht Europe .
785358:41	Well if he 's keeping forward with his policies , why did he have to sack the man ?
785445:10	Therefore I must ensure that trade unions of representatives at works councils are not trade unions .
785455:7	We must investigate and act to utilize what ways we can to defeat such abuse and division .
785468:19	As an internationalist labour organization we must also stretch our wings and offer help and expertise to our fellow workers in these countries .
785475:20	West German trade unions have already had to take action to re to prevent their government from denying equal conditions to workers in the former East Germany .
785476:10	We too must play our part .
785492:12	Eastern European workers must be informed on what to expect and how best to deal with it .
785494:8	This must be an ongoing and er , this must be an ongoing commitment by the G M B and we would ask that the executive report back on the situation in Eastern European regularly and at least at every annual congress .
785494:28	This must be an ongoing and er , this must be an ongoing commitment by the G M B and we would ask that the executive report back on the situation in Eastern European regularly and at least at every annual congress .
785504:59	You know we 're only gonna get the best from European initiatives when we start realizing we must deal with the present , in order to shape the future remembering the cruel lessons many of us have learned , particularly during the last twelve years .
785557:153	With increased accident rates and the ever increasing development of small workplaces , with little health and safety protection where , where our members are mainly women , part-time workers , in addition to the growth of sub-contracting and competitive tendering , and the increasing number of home workers , mean that we have to re-evaluate our priorities , and as such our health and safety service must be equipped to provide all the necessary support and information to underpin our activities in these vital areas of recruitment and growing sections of employment .
785557:188	With increased accident rates and the ever increasing development of small workplaces , with little health and safety protection where , where our members are mainly women , part-time workers , in addition to the growth of sub-contracting and competitive tendering , and the increasing number of home workers , mean that we have to re-evaluate our priorities , and as such our health and safety service must be equipped to provide all the necessary support and information to underpin our activities in these vital areas of recruitment and growing sections of employment .
785567:34	In the scale of unnecessary occupational accidents and disease , we must ensure our service support effective activity at the workplace .
785582:14	The G M B must continue to fight for the best health and safety standards at the workplace .
785593:158	Erm , in the point that was raised from the London region , talking about resources in dealing with er regional health and safety officers and their time , part of the er document itself , is looking at consultation , so that the resource implications and the necessary action that we have to take in identifying priorities , deals with those things and those things are now opened up to discussion , er by accepting the report , and we 'll be looking at that over this next year .
785630:36	Doctors could buy the much needed equipment , they would n't have to work such long hours , there would be no need to close down wards , aye or even hospitals .
785642:43	President , Kevin , Lancashire region , in the light of your comments , I must admit I do n't expect anything less or more of G M B than what it always does , and that 's put its actions where its words are .
785719:116	And because of a very mild T S S infection , it 's very unlikely that my daughter will ever have another child , so I wholeheartedly support the composite motion , but want to emphasize what we as individuals must do .
785739:8	We have to reach them , but how ?
785740:61	If you 're a school governor or a member of a P T A or just a parent , you must demand that the real facts of life and death are part of sex and hygiene education .
785741:40	If you have daughter or a granddaughter , or a niece , you must speak out .
785742:90	If you are involved with a youth club , or guides , or venture scouts or whatever , anywhere you can reach the ears and minds of young girls you must speak out and tell it how it really is .
785773:80	We 've all come to use the word condom in public conversation and nobody gets embarrassed about that any more , and that 's what has to happen now .
785775:48	Tampons are something that only women use , but it 's something that must become part of our voc vocabulary if we 're to save lives .
785791:7	I had to bawl those people out for not having due consideration to the effects of other human beings and the problems that they have .
785801:49	Congress , the woman worker is often low paid , and suffers from the menopause symptom and has to pay the full prescription charges for a treatment of H R T .
785827:108	There has been a marked increase in the number of women working in isolated areas and the G M B has been campaigning for improvements in safety on public transport , a campaign which must continue .
785828:7	Employers must also real realize their responsibilities in ensuring that their employees do not work in fear of attack .
785831:43	Whilst we appreciate the financial constraints being faced upon the public sector , we must not accept this as a reason for doing nothing .
785870:27	I know of a young female who had to show a leading hand a tampon out of her pocket , to prove that she needed a toilet .
785880:20	President , colleagues , this harassment has got to be stopped .
785881:7	There must be hundreds of females and males out there too frightened to speak out in case they lose their jobs , because let 's not forget there have been many cases in which males have been harassed or are being ha harassed .
785894:18	The cancer screening , everybody must remember as Kevin said on the toxic shock erm motion , that it 's your wife , your sister , your daughter who needs the cancer screening , the same thing applies to the toxic shock syndrome .
785896:28	There is no need for us to actually have to drill into people , that we do n't want to be bullied , pushed around , and that nine times out of ten , the violence or the bullying is male to female .
785922:7	We must put a stop to employees being put at risk , and being pressurized by ruthless employers to work unsafe , under the threat of if you do n't do it , then we 'll get somebody that will .
785947:21	The right to stop the job has to be our campaign cry , lay officials and full-time officials must integrate the priority of health and safety issues .
785947:59	The right to stop the job has to be our campaign cry , lay officials and full-time officials must integrate the priority of health and safety issues .
785970:73	We are already too stretched , and the law does not give us automatic ex access to time off for training , but we have got to ask , and we should commit the G M B to lobby for an extension of existing laws , and to lobby for various E C funds , and then we can begin to make a real impact on the environment .
786032:22	Everyone knows that you do n't have to play tennis to suffer from tennis elbow , likewise carpal tunnel is not the cause by vibrating hand tools .
786033:13	The G M B must continue the campaign for recognition of the many still unrecognized upper limb disorders , and all the causes of these painful conditions .
786037:49	This union 's campaigned tirelessly for recognition of industrial diseases and their causes , this campaign must continue .
786052:64	As composite seven points out , when our members are injured or made ill by their work , they should not have to wait years for compensation , we need a system which is swift , fair and comprehensive .
786107:72	It went this conference believes , that the role of trade union councils at local level , whose value is clearly acknowledged , must be strengthened by being given the right to express a view through its democratically elected delegates at annual conference within the framework of the T U C .
786125:72	We do n't go to trades councils as individuals , we 're there as representatives of our individual trades unions , and we have to abide by those rules .
786202:42	Unhappily now we are older it has all disappeared , and we must fight again just to retain the few rights we still have , such as state pensions and what is left of the health service .
786209:9	This government have to be made to realize what a cruel blow it has struck on the very weakest sections of the community , the unemployed and the five and half million pensioners living in poverty .
786210:59	Lack of travel concessions are another area involving burdens for many pensioners who cannot afford cars and have to rely on public transport .
786217:7	This must be preserved
786219:7	this must be preserved for f future pen pensioners , that 's you , as well as for those of today .
786238:206	Er , this particular disease , Alzheimer 's disease was identified by Jim , who was the deputy mayor , a member of ours , who spoke to you earlier in the week , as one of the hidden diseases in our society , where more help should be given not just from the people who suffer from the disease , but from their , for their families who have to support them .
786290:82	More recently I understand that Chris has had er had a very interesting , made a very interesting study of the French trade union movement , that must have been fascinating .
786295:96	Actually the last time I was stood up on a platform and did this was in front of erm a S G T congress in Dieppe and I tell you I had to do it in French , and it was much more difficult so I 'm hoping this one will go smoothly , but I , what I 'd really like to do is begin with is offer you erm delegates and platform both , a very very warm welcome from the trade union movement in Portsmouth .
786335:51	He told M Ps rising unemployment of the recession have been the price we have had to pay to get inflation down .
786359:7	This must be remedied .
786388:30	Now these are the kind of people we have to deal with and I know Duncan has a problem in USDAW there 's Gerry the negotiator for the London Region .
786389:62	I think that conference should know this is the kind of employer that even the trade union Political Staffs have to deal with .
786396:171	I have said consistently we do n't want to be the first in the industry , I would rather await either N A C O T , N A C O M or the U D M seeing what they , the outcome is there as we have traditionally done and then take it from there where you must agree that we have usually improved on their offer when it 's been made .
786400:85	We need to recruit more members within USDAW , but I 'll give you one guarantee , it 's one battle within the trade union movement that we must win .
786431:31	You get Ann , senile dementia , they had to get the taps off the gas fire because she kept turning it on and off without it being lit again , found wandering in her nightclothes , injustice , and then we found Eileen , who was in an upstairs room , yes she enjoyed that life for about five years , great council house then she had an accident and then because she could n't re- house her , she was a virtual prisoner inside her own home that she 'd made up .
786466:10	This we must do , we 've gotta help our unemployed members because some of those who are unemployed have been some of our best fighters and they 're still in there fighting despite the fact they have n't their jobs .
786468:8	We must contact these people , we must build back the confidence to the unemployed , we 've given these people who are unemployed our good training , we need their expertise to come back and fight again if we 're gonna have any hope for the future .
786468:24	We must contact these people , we must build back the confidence to the unemployed , we 've given these people who are unemployed our good training , we need their expertise to come back and fight again if we 're gonna have any hope for the future .
786499:44	Therefore , if they , the unemployed , want help from the State they must pay back from that State with some form of work , because you ca n't have something for nothing , not in a capitalist market economy .
786562:12	Although I have to say that the implication in two eight three that Labour is flirting with workfare is misplaced , we 've said some harsh things about the Party this week , but there is no possibility that I know of of the Labour Party supporting any form of workfare whatsoever .
786612:9	So I have to ask has anyone , and I underline anyone , who talks about economic policies , recessions , recoveries and jobs , yet begun to face up to the way everything depends on growth as before and even more growth than before .
786631:94	Now just in case you think I 'm sinking into the role of a self-righteous preacher , who enjoys telling other people off about their sins , so that he does n't have to bother about his own ,
786634:8	I must add in all honesty and so we must face up to things that the churches at any rate in their public and visible life are in just the same state .
786634:31	I must add in all honesty and so we must face up to things that the churches at any rate in their public and visible life are in just the same state .
786642:8	You have to try and improve trading skills and efficiency and it is vital to maintain organized groups of women and men who are committed to fighting locally and at all levels for ordinary decent decency and simple justice in the way people are treated of course , but we have got also to find ways of getting together to face those problems no one knows how to solve .
786665:53	Across parties , across ideologies and fixed ideas , to collaborate for a real change which surely must come .
786673:11	If we had to think and had to think together we would surely find ways forward .
786673:24	If we had to think and had to think together we would surely find ways forward .
786682:161	In short , restoring ordinary people as part of the we who run things , rather than the them for obstacles to be regulated , managed , I fear even duped and certainly simply left out , and the chief place to focus our search for pragmatic coalitions and cooperative democracy must be in our local communities .
786683:39	That is where people live and that is where we must support one another in enduring the present , while we imagine better things , fight for better things and gradually achieve better things .
786686:33	This is where the future lies however you have to deal with the particular problems of Maastricht and all the rest and on this side , and it really was very moving that , in a way by chance , but you know again I believe I think sometimes God is in you better of course
786689:123	They find new ways of sharing what resources there are , whether collaborating in local policing or working with health authorities or whatever it is and I think they form the base for renewal of politics because we have to recreate politics for localities upwards and here , just finally chancing my arm , I must just frankly say that I am not clear that over-large amalgamations of unions will be much more helpful than over-centralized government bureaucracies .
786689:173	They find new ways of sharing what resources there are , whether collaborating in local policing or working with health authorities or whatever it is and I think they form the base for renewal of politics because we have to recreate politics for localities upwards and here , just finally chancing my arm , I must just frankly say that I am not clear that over-large amalgamations of unions will be much more helpful than over-centralized government bureaucracies .
786705:33	If trade union solidarity is to mean anything , it must mean that each and every worker sharing equally in the benefit of members and paid equally for the service .
786753:37	Aid workers in central Bosnia have told the United Nations it must act to protect more than a thousand Moslems trapped in the Croatian controlled enclave of Vareys .
786755:78	the head of the operation in central Bosnia said the Moslems had been subjected to blatant human rights abuses and the U N might soon have to evacuate them .
786758:97	Eventually the situation continues to deteriorate which it probably will everything indicates that er the situation in Vareys is explosive , erm the U N nations may be forced to have to evacuate these people and obviously there are implications involved in that .
786768:7	You have to dial the code O six O two if you 're ringing from outside the Nottingham area .
786772:51	So if you 'd like to play the game the only rule is that you must n't have played a phone in competition on this programme in the last four weeks .
786854:24	Bye this is the singer you have to identify .
786933:56	Yeah you see , bric-a-brac is n't so readily available now there are car boot sales so we have to resort to other means like the sponsored dog walk and er this type of thing .
787107:16	I mean you have to save up for it here do n't you ?
787114:36	Yes oh yes another about another six years probably but we had to come back to educate the kids .
787197:92	Erm well we put two cats through as well so erm I think it all in all with the flights out and the flights back and the quarantine it must have been about three thousand pounds .
787248:59	and sort of guarded and slept I do n't I do n't know how she slept because it must have been very uncomfortable .
787436:86	That 's right and and to er er sort of fogies of my age it does seem a bit strange but these days the video and the recording have got to go together have n't they ?
787439:167	It 's all to do with marketing but then again it 's all to do with the reason for that is I suppose that 's what people want you know if they see a video er er if they watch a video on television and they listen to the song it has to add up you know , it ca n't just be a a story book of one thing and a song about another thing you know .
787454:88	The Irish have settled into this country and there are communities of them all over do they go and see your concerts and if they do that must mean a great deal to them I should think ?
787473:91	You know I went and showed my dogs over there and afterwards we all went to the pub and we had one hell of a time and then I had to sing would you believe it ?
787479:87	Why why does it have cos you think of Wales as the land of song why does it happen that if you go to Ireland you have got to sing ?
787485:9	But you must be erm erm you 've obviously got to be Guinness addicted .
787546:13	You 've never had to eat fire to get
787564:46	But surely at the beginning when you two came along , the record industry must have thrown up their hands in horror and said , Well you know this this wo n't sell you wo n't sell any records this this is finished .
787572:38	Wonderful song still goes down as good as ever and I have to say we still get the same buzz out of singing it every night .
787608:7	You have to dial the code O six O two if you 're ringing from outside the Nottingham area and if you ring us please have pen and paper with you cos we 'll give you a number to ring back .
787776:26	Now be kind to her because it must be awful living in Grantham hello Sharon .
787816:37	In the centre of Nottingham Trinity Square busy but you wo n't have to queue for the Victoria Centre or the Broadmoor next update in ten minutes time .
787829:25	But Calverton 's six hundred and forty miners must wait another twenty four hours before hearing their fate because the Coal Board have refused to say whether they want to close the pit or reduce its workforce .
787839:14	They would have had to have done it within three weeks anyway and I think the way they are looking at it if they do that tomorrow then they 're counting from then till the next stage .
787845:18	Bishop Daley said we must appeal repeatedly to those faceless heartless murderers of all organizations and to all those who identify with them to stop their diabolical activities .
787846:8	We must appeal to Government and those charged with political responsibility to treat this intolerable situation with the urgency and priority it deserves .
787887:44	The law lords in their ruling talk of the agony of mind the men must have suffered as they alternated between hope and despair .
787920:61	In Nottingham city centre you 'll find space to park at the Broadmarsh Centre and Fletchergate you wo n't have to queue for the Victoria Centre car park but Trinity Square that 's proving to be fairly busy so expect a short wait to park there .
787932:128	Erm other places to watch out for in Baysford the work is continuing on David Lane and Southwick Street the crossing there is closed diversions are in place and there have been long delays in the area there so unless you have to I would n't .
788153:15	I think it must be close
788218:9	Mm lovely must phone and get a brochure for that one .
788295:92	Oh you are , oh right erm I 'm searching for your prize list I know I had one there all these bits of paper you have to bring in every day .
788524:9	Guy Fawkes has got to answer for , has n't he .
788557:53	British Coal have put Calverton Colliery into review , but the pit 's six hundred and forty miners must wait another twenty four hours to hear whether they intend closing the pit or just reducing its workforce .
788604:7	You have to dial the code O six O two if you are ringing from outside the Nottingham area .
788703:10	You 've had to wait for me I 'm afraid .
788709:7	You must have been spoilt rotten Dennis Lotus , er singing with a band like Ted Heath .
788717:29	Following from Richard and Jenny erm , they both had to attend a meeting in Dublin but it 's with absolutely no other alternative .
788741:7	It must be right , assuming it must be .
788741:27	It must be right , assuming it must be .
788762:55	Er , my suggestion is actually that er , the suggestion form should be suggestion forms and we must all suggestions to start .
788767:125	The implication of this though is that where a member of staff makes a suggestion about the way the department should be run , where the divisional quality manager thinks that suggestion should not be taken aboard er , feedback has to be given and , and some reason why .
788794:12	You do n't have to change it .
788821:39	It means the whole sale change of forms and colours and it must reduce the range of other colours that we have for other forms , do n't necessarily go into those wallets .
788826:16	So , we 'd have to change the colour structure on everything . .
788833:54	No , there are probably other forms already existing on those colours , we presume we would have to take off those colours .
788834:12	We only probably have to take seven standard colours off in the end .
788838:50	All I 'm saying is the forms that are mentioned in the procedure that have to go in those wallets ought to be in those colours , so red , so pink .
788840:33	Yes , but then do all , all costing forms have to on the same colour ?
788936:12	You do n't have to have one .
789010:38	It seems remarkably sensible apart from writing down exactly what Marie has to check .
789021:17	Confirm that you still have to work with .
789025:4	have to push it in the right place .
789035:16	So , then all we have to do is make that a statement .
789054:34	Erm , on software we said we said we had to add that into our procedures anyhow , last , on our last year view meeting , did n't we , which is what we 've done and we 've also as of today set up a system of logging new software coming in and signing it .
789064:48	What I , one of the things that I , I think you must have somewhere , and that is that at some stage you order something , you get it in and somehow someone has to tell accounts that yes , they can pay that invoice .
789064:113	What I , one of the things that I , I think you must have somewhere , and that is that at some stage you order something , you get it in and somehow someone has to tell accounts that yes , they can pay that invoice .
789074:38	What we 've , so what it means is we have to make it clear to those people who are authorised to sign off invoices that their signature not only authorises accounts to pay it but also signifies that the delivery has been checked and is erm , is adequate .
789087:17	I mean , you have to buy from a supplier that 's on .
789101:9	Do we have to say sub-contractors ?
789110:22	Do I , for general purposes , have to carry on going through all the cost estimates and and stuff like that ?
789114:37	Erm , quality of print paper down the print shop does have to be checked so they may well use as a guide but they wo n't necessarily go thorough all the cost estimates .
789173:14	I think that must be the same thing .
789225:9	Does that have to be quality ?
789309:27	As the last said , it does not have to be , ' cos you felt that someone else had some more energy , ' cos you 're praying for energy performs and you sited some examples .
789322:34	So , er , of all the things that we still have to do before erm , er , our proper external audit , this to me seems the most critical and if we do n't complete the task , it seems to me , in the next week or two , the likelihood of it being in place and auditable in our next trial is very limited .
789456:59	When we 're writing the , the things that do n't apply in the job file we have to , presumably we have to reference procedure , say we 're not following this Q P five point five but we are doing .
789456:75	When we 're writing the , the things that do n't apply in the job file we have to , presumably we have to reference procedure , say we 're not following this Q P five point five but we are doing .
789462:122	The idea , the idea of it though and from an auditor 's point of view one of the things they will be looking at is that every one where you wrote when we are not doing this must have a valid reason and a new methodology must be met on how you are going to cover that particular aspect and that must be authorised .
789462:144	The idea , the idea of it though and from an auditor 's point of view one of the things they will be looking at is that every one where you wrote when we are not doing this must have a valid reason and a new methodology must be met on how you are going to cover that particular aspect and that must be authorised .
789462:190	The idea , the idea of it though and from an auditor 's point of view one of the things they will be looking at is that every one where you wrote when we are not doing this must have a valid reason and a new methodology must be met on how you are going to cover that particular aspect and that must be authorised .
789478:10	She 'll have to do the manual but if anyone could do the general
789491:15	However , we still have to do the other bit to go in the , yes .
789492:24	Yes , yes , so we then have to , now who is that erm , sorry what are the ones that now have to have this thing in the front of its master job file .
789492:77	Yes , yes , so we then have to , now who is that erm , sorry what are the ones that now have to have this thing in the front of its master job file .
789515:18	I think we are have got to go back down again .
789549:78	A few areas where people have just got to make sure that they do things , people are mostly clear about what they have to do , erm they seem very , very positive .
789597:51	What I will do , is I 'll split , there are two erm , has got to comply with the procedure or there is a procedure change and I 'll split that into two columns so that it 's a bit more clear
789685:16	Did you use to have to be able to say refer to job descriptions .
789694:39	We have n't actually mentioned it , one of the things have to fulfil the training requirement there .
789720:17	No , but you will have to consider
789722:37	I 'm still thinking about B S 5750 where we have to make sure that not only we know what training we have given people , that we also continue to give them , future appropriate training so that they can do their jobs , and so compliance by B S 5750 is not just trapping history it is also making sensible plans about the present and the future .
789727:31	As once you have dealt with history , you have to put in place something that keeps it up to date , without too much labour and without erm , a major hole there where things fall into the middle cover and come out .
789763:55	Okay , we can agree what I have said so far but then I 'm going to have to look at other things once I 've made further changes .
789799:209	No I do n't think that 's , sorry , I think it is perfectly possible for Stella to make this assumption to get them changed and to come with the revised version which says , which is apparently what Jenny has done here , this looks to me , in a not unreasonable way , it looks , she is saying something is there , this must be an example of what Stella means , data can be stored in three different ways where clearly previously that said four different ways .
789801:7	We must do a formal vote as it were .
789802:57	Well I have done it this way even for trivial things , because I understood that the committee had to approve the changes and if as I said it seem to me erm , wasteful to get er , Monica to make the changes when they might not be accepted .
789818:12	You do n't have to re-read the whole of the procedure
789837:74	Is it possible , this is quite a bit of work we 're just about to enter into , which we may have to repeat .
789840:64	if any of them relate to a procedure we take it at the same time so that we do n't have to do it again , or not ?
789934:22	No , but have n't they had to call their client files , client master job files and if you get an enquiry from an existing client they will probably want to put that enquiry back in that folder .
789969:101	I have two points to make by suggestion : - one is that I think that the final of these related documents should be discretionary I do n't see why you should have to keep the file .
789979:108	I 'm just thinking you have written proposing you 've got the file in front of the client , the job is dead and gone and never going to come back , do you have to file that lot away somewhere ?
789983:54	What ca n't ca n't , do we really need this because it does n't say you have to throw it away after a year .
789985:35	We are taking about the related documents now , basic form has to be finalised .
790023:47	Happily carrying on doing that it 's not going to be every enquiry has to do that .
790024:12	So they do have to put it in the individual enquiry ?
790030:59	But what we ca n't , it 's absolutely but if you write it in all the other divisions have got to do it as well .
790061:7	We must have a target .
790148:44	I certainly did , yes , I certainly made a point that you must be careful that , erm , particularly the self-employed , that you do n't exceed the maximum allowable .
790175:18	I think I 'd have to actually , should have perhaps warned you about this , but er , er , in point of fact , not too many people got this , I think there was one of two that got this wrong .
790229:7	I must remember to get some oil for you Peter ?
790302:18	Yes , yes , I must remind you to do that , Karen .
790395:14	All you had to do as an employee in all honesty , was get up in the morning , and you had , the decision you had to make is , how do I get to work for half past eight ?
790395:84	All you had to do as an employee in all honesty , was get up in the morning , and you had , the decision you had to make is , how do I get to work for half past eight ?
790411:12	You do n't have to queue up and buy tickets at the , the little box thing .
790421:76	We did n't make the decision to find out , look I 've got a complimentary ticket , and perhaps I do n't have to queue here , perhaps I might have to , but I 'll go and find out .
790421:100	We did n't make the decision to find out , look I 've got a complimentary ticket , and perhaps I do n't have to queue here , perhaps I might have to , but I 'll go and find out .
790428:7	You have to earn the right from now on to have holidays , because when you 're on holiday , nobody 's going to be paying you .
790430:9	So you have to earn the right from now on , to have time off .
790443:10	Because everybody must have a plan .
790458:9	Every plan must have a starting point , it must have an objective .
790458:29	Every plan must have a starting point , it must have an objective .
790459:18	A root , and you must be able to monitor that root .
790564:171	The car 's just a practical thing to me , I mean I like to drive around in comfort , everybody likes a nice car , I 'm not saying that , but to go to the extreme of spending what would say , seventy or eighty thousand pounds on a Porsche , I 'd have to be really , really rich before I would consider the luxury of having a Porsche .
790603:58	yes , he 's took a photo of him sitting on the bike so you then he just had to pin it up on , on my thingy , and it 'd say , you know , you 'll never have this , it 'll give you something to , to go for .
790730:22	So eventually you 're going to have to sit down with us and tell us how much you want .
790738:37	Well you 're not going to get it , you 'll have to do it yourselves .
790740:17	You 're going to have to put some input in if you want it for free , that 's all I 'm going to say .
790784:39	From next Thursday night , when you do your telephone session , you must go live on this form that you 'll be filling in the names that you are going to contact , right ?
790867:7	You had to make twenty seven approaches to make one sale .
790966:253	They , they did have the option that they could have had complete absolute egalitarianism and made everybody into a poor peasant , but the commun but the commun the Communist Party were progressive and they s saw that how that you needed to have industrialization in order to increase the welfare of peasants which was their ultimate aim , and I mean it appears that how that they did n't actually care er what kinds of means they 'd have to achieve that , as in capitalism was justified in this longer term perspective .
790968:55	Well it 's not , they 're not saying it 's solved they 're saying it has to be delayed until it 's actually possible .
790989:7	They had to improve the productivity
790990:12	they , they had to improve the productivity from the land and im well not productivity , just efficiency generally , and that how that it would n't have made economic sense for them to have gone straight for socialism .
791018:43	and if it was forced upon them that this land 's going to have to be put into a , a kind of block
791057:41	Now if , if you take those bits er would n't one have to argue that , that the move into capitalization was straight away
791059:102	was w would not go down very well , i it , it would mean overturning the whole emphasis of policy and it would mean going against So you , A you would have to change your policy , B you would have to force the process .
791059:128	was w would not go down very well , i it , it would mean overturning the whole emphasis of policy and it would mean going against So you , A you would have to change your policy , B you would have to force the process .
791069:13	Also one would have to work out whether peasants were subsistence minded in that how that once they 'd achieved their subsistence was that all they would want or would they really want to sort of erm work harder and start sharing all their tools and implements in order to gain an even higher productivity .
791127:116	so erm investing into industry which I do n't know much about , and I , I am suspicious that invest into industry anyway erm so it 's gonna have , to work it 'll have to be quite a long term policy , well I imagine it would n't be a short-term policy .
791128:85	So in , rational grounds y y you would be arguing that , that if we 're going to set this policy up we 're going to have to accept that i it 's going , it is going to be a long term policy .
791179:17	Er er er my reassurance has got to be look this is a long way off .
791274:32	if we 're going to industrialize the way has got to be through the promotion of a rich peasant economy .
791612:62	You know the sort of uncontrollable nature of , of most of it that , that meant they had to get on with it .
791637:81	I think the reason they probably did this because it 's , it 's , it was politically harder to do that , they would 've had to taken a lot more responsibility .
791642:10	you 'd have to have a huge sort of bureaucratic structure
791658:46	gonna be pretty safe , it 's gonna be pretty stable , we do n't have to get our f hands dirty erm you know
791756:12	did they actually have to claim how much , I mean er you know they produced , cos all we 're saying here is they 're just taking a a nominal amount which they stipulate at the beginning of a three year period , and they 're just gonna take that .
791771:105	Tax erm I ca n't remember where it was that , I think it might have been one of you saying that how that a peasant of subsistence level erm would still have to pay eighteen percent of its income
791803:7	You have to keep them happy in order to
791861:52	Which meant that net of tax you would , y your , your yield would have to be about eight hundred in order to , net of tax , give you just under seven hundred .
791878:28	that how that erm landlords in practice had to reduce the level of taxation
791887:11	But the assumption must have been that before nineteen forty nine there was a lot of that going on
791900:29	But I think we , we , we do have to recognize that , that not only are we looking at a land reform process which is providing a lot of peasants with what
791929:16	so that they really had to be brought out .
792005:14	But clearly some way must be found to prevent the open house that is all our concern to safeguard the amenity and character of the county .
792012:114	On location where what criteria might be used to guide location , I 've said it 's most unlikely to be found in a built-up area , but clearly close to good communications networks is important and must be within a reasonably short travel time of the national highway network .
792020:64	Another safeguard that it seems to me that any such policy should have should be that development of the site must be possible without breaching reasonable and appropriate environmental standards .
792021:18	So that in itself it must not create er air pollution or water pollution and so on .
792032:59	What I have n't done and I ought to because of the erm the way that this discussion has to unfold , I ought to say that pure few sentences about why should there be a strategic sites policy at all and erm I ought to put that on the record although it 's pretty well trailed in all the paper work .
792038:84	In a planners ideal world where we might have a wholly directed economy competition would not be relevant but I 'm afraid the reality is we have to compete in North Yorkshire with other counties in er this region and with other regions in Britain with other countries in the European Union and with other countries in the world .
792072:32	It is also fair to say , and I must be up front about this because it is a matter of it is probably the most sensitive aspect of this whole debate , is about B eight warehousing and distribution .
792092:13	But I 'll have to be very careful with it I I do expect , I would expect , that there would be inquiries for that kind of investment here erm it 's just that we have n't any major ones in the last couple of years of that type because the overall framework here is opposed to it .
792097:31	It 's sorry , I 'm going to have to do some mathematics because what my friend is telling me it it curious it 's it 's the thirty four per hectare .
792101:51	on the basis of a hundred per hundred thousand square feet to which you 'd have to add obviously a sort of surrounding area from the square footage used for a distribution warehouse , it looks as though it 's around about the thirteen
792117:42	Surely in a way I 'm answering my own point , you would have to go beyond just having a set of words on paper which says we have a major exceptions policy .
792148:130	In fact the revised economic development strategy which Professor Lock probably does n't have a copy of , refers to inward inward investment as being desirable erm and is of critical importance but whilst it will be vigorously sort in this way it has to be said that the bulk of North Yorkshire suffers from a relative lack of financial incentives from Central Government in terms of whose regional policy does not have a priority .
792160:72	And I think this inward investment that Professor Lock is referring to and the scale of investment that he is referring to must be considered as additional and and would draw in additional jobs .
792191:29	In effect anything allocated under I five would have to be made available in or in or around main settlements .
792199:121	And it appears from what the county council has said that they are they 're not necessarily opposed to this sort of development that we 're we 're looking at here but that er the case would have to be proven as an exception to normal planning policy .
792204:71	It 's clear from from that sort of policy that the need for or benefits arising from the development would always have to be assessed against environmental and other considerations , for example , regional strategy .
792233:17	Erm where I have to qualify my my support is is , and and I do particularly want to stress that in no way would I accept the exceptions policy as a substitute to an appropriate increase in the employment alloca allocation for Selby District .
792257:129	Er the first of erm er three three million square feet , second of four and a half , and erm the er in both cases it triggered the call-in procedure under the departure and in both cases er a public inquiry had to be held er or the Secretary of State chose to call a public inquiry .
792293:31	I it is not envisaged I mean I must n't mislead you at all I want I want to be understood on this issue .
792298:110	I think what I imagined erm Miss Whittaker and Chairman is that erm if you get the criteria right then this exceptions policy would also be an exception to I eleven , but it would have to pass this criteria .
792299:20	In other words it would have to be job beneficial , it would have to be of strategic importance and and all those other things we 've been discussing .
792299:44	In other words it would have to be job beneficial , it would have to be of strategic importance and and all those other things we 've been discussing .
792330:52	Find some of them insist on finding their own cage and er so you do then have to er have a flexible approach .
792358:113	And if that allocation is pushed through , if you like in the teeth of the structure plan policy , but it becomes your local plan , and that 's the legislation provides for that , that surely must be the the question .
792403:25	I 'm not sure how clearly I have to spell this out .
792438:227	And and what I 've got in front of me , David Lock , what I 've got in front of me is is erm , and I know David 's got it David Allenby 's got it as well , is the er paper from Harrogate 's Economic Development Officer to his Economic Development Sub-Committee , and it 's gone all the way through the process now and through the main council , where he has to answer that very question and I could n't put it better .
792460:12	They do n't have to worry too much about the eventualities and all the other sins that the planning process is concerned with .
792585:18	I think we 'd have to have to make our views known on that .
792585:25	I think we 'd have to have to make our views known on that .
792598:99	Er but we acknowledge that over time circumstances may change and that it may be appropriate and such circumstances erm needs may change different circumstances may arise and they would have to be dealt with within the strategic planning framework .
792599:97	Erm if at some time in the future a local plan picked up a change in circumstances and made a cogent argument inn favour of varying from the strategic framework , we would have to consider that on its merits .
792624:72	Bearing in mind that this is I suppose now going to be one of the performance indicators er that local authorities have got to er publish every year .
792630:76	As for er as for departures , a strategic context in terms of a structure plan policy erm that allows for major exceptions will must surely assist in in considering any application that comes forward as a as a departure under under .
792667:99	There are , finding fifty hectares or thereabouts for a development of this kind and characteristic out of the districts ' allocations on the one hand in their geography , you know that has to be broadly speaking within the existing settlement pattern on the other , not possible .
792700:42	And I would add that the Economic Development Officer also acknowledges that he must work within the strategic framework which is the policy of the county council .
792718:85	I 'm grateful to North Yorkshire and through you to the Strensall people for the arrangements and the use of the Village Hall and I think I must commend Mr Whipp for his fortitude through the last week or so .
792822:41	I think we 're very well organized here and we do n't have to worry too much about it .
792894:10	You really have to make it inconvenient for the car or improve local transport .
792994:10	Well I have to say it is n't suitable .
793037:26	I think their suggestion was that they had to go via Norwood Gardens because they then turned right at the in and went up into the middle of and it was to get them on to that line that they had to go through .
793037:129	I think their suggestion was that they had to go via Norwood Gardens because they then turned right at the in and went up into the middle of and it was to get them on to that line that they had to go through .
793205:7	You have to stop
793316:17	If they 're gonna have to cut hole out and put it in .
793321:13	It 'll still have to be cut in though would n't it ?
793328:10	It would have to be
793536:10	I 'd have to ask him again about that .
793703:65	their own back benches in rural counties are kicking up so much in Somerset and Hampshire in particular that they 've had to back down .
793720:36	I mean that thing I went to on Wednesday it must have cost thousands of pounds .
793891:23	Well the annual parish we do have to have an annual parish meeting .
793893:12	And we do have to have a meeting of an annual meeting of the council to elect your officers .
793988:10	did n't have to pay the costs , it did n't really arise
794180:49	But er we shall be without him for the next fortnight erm so somebody 'll have to come in and score a few goals for us but often you know , you discover things that erm you never knew were there when you have to fill in gaps that have suddenly arisen .
794180:137	But er we shall be without him for the next fortnight erm so somebody 'll have to come in and score a few goals for us but often you know , you discover things that erm you never knew were there when you have to fill in gaps that have suddenly arisen .
794215:114	Erm obviously most teams will win their home matches , particularly with the travelling that 's going off , so if we can sneak a win when we go away and get a win tonight then we must be in with a good chance .
794272:7	You must be joking at seven
794381:11	Notts County have got to finish top of the English section of group A .
794396:56	He does n't look the sort of player to me that would score many goals I have to say .
794420:11	What they must not do is to get in there at half time and think that they have done their job .
794544:7	I must say .
794559:134	He 's wide on the right , holding it up , looking for support , two in the middle , looks for , goes for it ca n't quite get the contact he would have wanted and it runs back to in what must be a very edgy Blackburn penalty area at the moment .
794563:7	Shrewsbury have got to make sure as much as possible when they do win the ball in the they do n't just smash long balls up , because as l as soon as they do that and as long as they keep doing that , Blackburn just pick up the ball again and keep coming at them , they 've got to try like they did just a few minutes ago , try and play themselves out of defence with nice low passes .
794582:52	has become an increasingly dangerous on this right hand side I have said just now they must try and stop this coming in because he is getting some magnificent balls in to the penalty area and sooner or later they 're gonna concede a goal .
794601:182	Paragraph three point seven describe in some detail with a figure of five hundred and fifty thousand pounds will become available in nine nineteen ninety three ninety four , when the rules change on the financing of structural maintenance on Principal Road , this sum would be enough to cover the two hundred and thirty thousand pound short that we mentioned previously has to cover the loan charges to sustain the same level of capital programme on schemes not aided by transport supplementary branch in nineteen ninety three four , as is currently being spent in this year .
794603:113	Yes thank you , a few things from our point of view is er three point eight , I 'm sure the policy will be well looked over by our friend , comments by members have to make please .
794636:135	When the service review panel meets in February after the budget decisions that have been made , after T S G settled is known , that then panel will really decide the ninety three four category programme and quite clearly two million pound will have to be inserted at that stage for demand of the
794666:12	and er it must be borne in upon them that the alternative for us are not having money to keep up our roads programme is going to be very dangerous therefore I think there is no question that the recent test programme is the second priority for concern .
794806:7	I have to tell the survey that er er ten days ago I reported a , a very deep pothole in a most important road
794831:26	performing of street lighting er equipment , has to be conducted on site of basis , we have a system of scouting , the whole County is covered by paid scouts who every so often do a tour of their big network of units to ensure that there is , now one has to allow within the response time for the next cycle of

794945:61	if you widen it out we 're talking about a consultation and I think in many ways we must respect the local member , erm
794954:77	we need to resolve this one in consultation with Norfolk and er therefore Mr er , erm proposal that further consultation should take place must be the right one to follow .
794966:90	I 'd like to take that on board and review the situation that we give , given a predicament still therefore a purpose and I hear what Mr has to say and I look at that particular pelican crossing myself , and respect the
794973:73	I hope the negotiation with Norfolk will give us that opportunity and the negotiations with the Department of Transport as well , we must not leave them out , this they are crucial to the solution of the entirety of these province .
795021:59	The benefits , the law and the villages all along the edge of eighty eight are so enormous that we must try and sustain , and I 'm very hopeful that , would , with the good will of the whole of us we can improve the quality of life for everyone .
795042:36	and the eighty eight group in favour of happy and have to do the best , certainly
795045:17	erm , nevertheless I must report again on the plan eighty eight er on the A ten eighty eight , principally because even in England people realize that the villages in
795058:12	Chairman I must
795109:106	These are n't my figures they 're County Council figures The point is this , what is going to happen if positive action is to reduce the flow of traffic , I have to emphasize with you the flow of traffic is not taken .
795126:126	Er Chairman this , this matter has caused great concern in Bungay I can tell you , I went to the Bungay town meeting last night and they were absolutely horrified at the way this has been handled and I have to apologize on behalf of the , of the County Council .
795173:29	and further development , that 's all I have to add Mr Chairman .
795187:122	There are so many parts of this jigsaw that still are not in place and again Mr Chairman through you , I know you have similar to this , this case although you put it strongly it has to be widely publicized , we must be linked , not only to the rest of the country , but even more importantly now linked to the continent , welcome very much indeed , but not in place .
795187:144	There are so many parts of this jigsaw that still are not in place and again Mr Chairman through you , I know you have similar to this , this case although you put it strongly it has to be widely publicized , we must be linked , not only to the rest of the country , but even more importantly now linked to the continent , welcome very much indeed , but not in place .
795216:153	you can see in fact you know the position , for every option adopted in January I think the er , some of the things I 've seen will in fact will minimize the impact upon Pipers Vale , but I think that , I think we 'll have to wait until after Christmas to get the er final recommendations from the er from the
795252:12	Chairman I must respond to that , that the work secret road is not appraise donated to this organization , I think it 's one latched onto by the press to develop some headline , er nobody 's ever used that phrase about anything being secret in this organization whatsoever , the simple fact is that these drawings for your approval are not yet finished , that 's the extent of secrecy , my staff are still working on them , they 'll come
795256:14	er and Chairman I must say that as to request from County Council at Molds and County Council at Harson , from the Ipswich Borough Council for their copies of the plans which you have not yet received , I have to decline the protocol it takes that this committee is the first to see the county surveyor 's proposals , and I ca n't give any other elected member within Suffolk prior treatment over that to be quite honest .
795256:120	er and Chairman I must say that as to request from County Council at Molds and County Council at Harson , from the Ipswich Borough Council for their copies of the plans which you have not yet received , I have to decline the protocol it takes that this committee is the first to see the county surveyor 's proposals , and I ca n't give any other elected member within Suffolk prior treatment over that to be quite honest .
795263:50	for no more than one week , we are still studying the recommendations , the recommendations have to be embodied within the ultimate report for this community in
795336:186	No what amazes me Mr Chairman is that here we are , we 're being cost conscious on every ground and we 're saying we 're making a statement that we enter into an exercise that we have no idea , we 're not asking for the actual cost , we are asking , we are asking you must of had an idea what it would cost or I feel Mr Chairman that that , can I put it mildly , lack of planning and certainly financial planning possibly
795355:8	we have got to be , have confidence in our , in our consultants , that 's the important thing .
795372:60	Chairman six seven one , my report does indicate the officer who 's made the involvement , and he had to work
795393:22	but er , I think we must concentrate on the decisive people as well to get these places on
795421:134	sorry , Mr Chairman we have regular meetings with the Suffolk utilities and er this point can be made to them , although each of the utilities has it 's own colour , so that then perhaps those intended which are holes that have to be repaired , but certainly I can , I can erm understand Mr ' s concern and I will put it to the next meeting of the Suffolk Highway Meeting this week .
795432:58	There 's , we , we 've been struggling and trying to do ourselves and all we have to do is to allow Christ to come in to our lives , because he died to take away the sin , he dealt with the route cause of it , Christ in you , the hope of glory .
795485:9	His word has got to have that place of authority in our lives .
795492:115	And Jesus does n't just chat to us for the sake of chatting to us , he , when he speaks to us his words have authority , they have input , they are vital and we must pay attention to them .
795647:187	Then again , he talked with her because he longed to satisfy to meet her needs , as a human being she 'd aspiration , she 'd hope , she 'd desires and as she looked back on her life , some of them may have been fulfilled , some of her plans may have been realized , but there must have been an awful emptiness , and awful hollowness about so much .
795660:37	Why not have the light within you so you do n't have to go and get it outside but it 's there dwelling within you , day by day , moment by moment ?
795679:150	He says , you go and tell , go and tell your family and , she 's embarrassed said well erm erm , and if I did , do n't worry he said , I know you , I know your family situation , I know your background , you do n't have to tell me it , I know it all !
795745:9	And we have to confess Lord that , words are very easy to say and to sing
795751:18	Not withstanding Lord , we have to confess that we still fail you again and again , but we thank you that you provide power for us , to live lives that are pleasing to you .
795773:11	And so we must start off this morning with his , perhaps most famous of all interviews that Jesus had , the interview with Nicodemus there in John , er er chapter three part of which Elaine read for us earlier .
795775:140	This man , this religious leader , this pharisee who came to Jesus by night and as he comes to Jesus he , is full of questions , but Jesus does n't let him get too many of them out because the questions that Nicodemus has to ask are not the real issues .
795776:134	And you know , so often you and I , we have questions that we want to bring to the Lord , if only was here in person , if only we could sit him down in the front room , how many things we would have to ask of him !
795784:61	Do n't bother with the questions , let 's deal with the real heart issue , Nicodemus , you , have got to be born again .
795786:9	It must have been about the turn of the century the er Times newspaper ran a competition and it wa , the competition was a very simple one , difficult to answer but it was very simply put it was asking for people to write in letters and essays , and features and articles on , what was wrong with the world .
795788:16	He wrote what must have been the one of the shortest letters of all time , and he wrote back to the editor of The Times and he said , dear sir , in answer to your question what is wrong with the world
795796:70	It 's not other people , it 's not the problems that surround us , it 's not the people that we have to work with or the conditions in work , it 's not the next door neighbours , terrible though they may be , the real answer , for you and for me , lies within ourselves .
795798:12	Nicodemus , you have got to be born again .
795800:31	But however long or short it was , Nicodemus certainly must have learned a , a tremendous amount as he listened to Jesus .
795836:15	Says , Nicodemus you have got to be born again !
795838:76	Now , first of all Nicodemus does n't even understand what Jesus is talking about but even when he does , how he must of hurt his pride , but I 'm religious !
795846:12	Nicodemus you , must be born again .
795847:7	You have got to have a new start .
795893:44	But , throughout it all we see Jesus as not just a teacher , he must be more than that .
795943:7	You must be born again !
796000:25	We 've already read them , you must be born again !
796004:10	We simply have to be born again if we 're gonna be saved !
796013:174	And so it does n't matter how young we are , how old we are , it does n't matter what our background is , it does n't matter what our cultural experiences are , it does n't matter anything of the , of the outward about ourselves , every single one of us can be , and must be born again !
796020:82	And so , Nicodemus would have been familiar with this story , and Jesus says as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness , even so , must the son of man be lifted up , but whoever believes in him may have eternal life .
796028:31	Nicodemus , the important thing for you is you have got to be born again !
796031:205	You 've got your questions and of course I could answer them Nicodemus I could tell the why 's and the wherefore 's of this , and of that , I could give you all the details and all the the the things that you want to know but , they 're not really important the real issue for you , Nicodemus , is that you have got to be born again !
796042:7	You must be born again !
796043:267	We sang , a little earlier on , a song of er Wesley 's and back those two hundred and twenty , two hundred and thirty years ago , when Wesley was preaching in this country and in America , there was another preacher every bit as famous then , perhaps not quite so famous today , preacher by the name of George Whitfield and George Whitfield , he went around and he was preaching , and he preached on this , this text , John er , i in John three , you must be born again !
796045:164	And there was a lady in the , in his congregation he preached to masses , to thousands and thousands of people , and she came to him , she was , she was annoyed , she was a rather er , well-to-do lady , and she was offended at this this preaching that she had to be born again , and that people had to have this new birth experience .
796045:191	And there was a lady in the , in his congregation he preached to masses , to thousands and thousands of people , and she came to him , she was , she was annoyed , she was a rather er , well-to-do lady , and she was offended at this this preaching that she had to be born again , and that people had to have this new birth experience .
796046:115	And she came to Whitfield , and she said Mr Whitfield , why is it that you keep on preaching on this , and you keep on using this text , and keep on saying you must be born again ?
796048:14	simply because , you must be born again .
796052:59	What , no matter who he was , for all his background , Nicodemus , you , me , we have to be born again !
796164:39	There was somebody else higher up the line than Boaz and he must first be given the opportunity to redeem Ruth .
796176:37	It was n't just something you did lightly , you had to weigh it all up and consider the cost of it .
796179:85	And it says in th , in , as you read through the record , as soon as he saw him he shouted with a shout that must have surprised the passers by , because , he hollered out to him he called out excitedly to him !
796180:42	And so this near kinsman comes and he listens quietly to what Boaz has to say .
796205:61	First , the right to redeem on the ground of relationship , a stranger could n't do it , it had to be a near kinsman .
796207:19	And the third , the resources had to be there to redeem , there was a price to be paid .
796219:31	That 's the price our kinsman redeemer Jesus Christ had to pay !
796360:7	It must have looked a beautiful sight !
796367:14	They would n't have to pull in their belts , they would n't have to eke it out and ration themselves because there was n't enough , it was an abundant harvest !
796367:42	They would n't have to pull in their belts , they would n't have to eke it out and ration themselves because there was n't enough , it was an abundant harvest !
796393:51	We do n't always like what he does to us but it mus , we must never , ever it to make us bitter .
796404:52	But once we come back to that place , and wherever we go from him we have got to come back to where we started , where we left the road .
796426:59	And before Ruth and Naomi could know anything of God 's provision , there was two steps they had to take .
796428:15	The first thing they had to do , and oh this is a difficult one !
796429:7	They had to humble themselves .
796436:87	And so , er , when th the reapers were gathering in the harvest they were not allowed to go right to the edge of the field , they had to leave a border , they were not to go right into the corners , they were to leave those areas , so that the poorer members , so that those who did not have could come and could gather what was left behind .
796442:50	If we humble ourselves then he exults , and we exult ourself , he then has to humble us , and to be humbled by God is a fearful thing !
796446:25	And then the second thing was , they had to be willing to work .
796450:7	They had to work hard .
796515:16	And you do n't have to wait , we ca n't wait until the end , he said but now is the harvest time , get on with the job now !
796540:61	And essentially in nineteen sixty eight sixty nine legislation changed in this country and up to that time what you had to do if you had a removals firm you had actually a licence .
796545:38	So if you wanted to be a removal man you had to find the work to justify you having an A licence , but of course you could n't because you had n't got an A licence to do it with .
796582:19	And at the swap over they had to swap equipment around for the reorganization .
796584:13	And I just have to go to or I just have to sort of explain that when you pack a van , you do n't pack it like the advert for KitKat .
796584:34	And I just have to go to or I just have to sort of explain that when you pack a van , you do n't pack it like the advert for KitKat .
796599:78	You have ties obviously to hold certain things in and if you 've only got a van with a a third full you 'll have to use the ties because there 's space left over .
796614:41	Cos if he gets rid of them first then he does n't have to worry about those things until er later which sometimes does happen .
796616:16	Or if suddenly you have to halt then the whole lot does n't come forward and squash into the next piece in front into the ne That 's why it 's edge on longways down so that the the wardrobe is that way edgeways on you see so that if you suddenly stop the weight of something there wo n't squash the the wardrobe .
796621:60	But when we went to Arch the school at Archbishop 's the two lads that went , they had to pack all these various different acid carboys .
796623:51	And they were b doing quite happily and quite merrily with all the bits and pieces they had to pack until they came to something they 'd never packed before .
796654:9	And I had to walk about fifty yards to get to the van because it was it was in an area that had been partly pedestrianized .
796693:76	So Ben said , Oh , I 'm terribly sorry he said , there was nobody else on the road and I I I must admit I did n't notice whether I had .
796709:66	So he er he was most upset was poor Ben so I did explain to him that what he had to do with policemen if they were n't feeling too good was to try and avoid saying things er quite as straightforwardly as that .
796715:11	But two men had to go .
796717:21	Well it was what we had to carry you see .
796720:11	I just have to look at the list of this cos I always tend to forget this .
796731:25	We moved it once and apparently it had to go a zoo after that cos when we moved it back it was about twelve foot long , and then of course it g grew even larger than that .
796735:99	Now of course I 'm not supposed to admit to these things , being a professional , bo b before I do admit it them as I am going to I have to say that er on an average year er year we do about one thousand five hundred jobs and in that time there will probably be about three or four claimable accidents that we 'll have .
796782:95	Cos if you leave d go the cord straight away the cord just goes shooting up there , the weight inside comes down here and you lose the cord and you have to take the whole lot p t apart in order to get the thing to work again .
796785:36	Sometimes if the the piece of furniture is very large you have to do the same with the top one where there 's another lap there , that one , another piece of beading there , and this will come out as well .
796796:14	All I have to do is push down , the man inside pushes up and the wardrobe slowly comes up like that .
796838:19	But I realized that I had to do something pretty dramatic to avoid too serious an accident .
796847:17	And I mean one had to be grateful because she was much more concerned about whether I 'd hurt myself falling off the ladder than her wardrobe .
796855:35	I think er I do n't know why but I must have just landed and done a s
796862:72	It was it was o it was a utility Er now it depends on your age now , you 're going to have to admit something here you see .
796882:17	I 'm going to have to move soon .
796885:44	He says , you know when I came to this house I had to have split all my furniture into little bits so I could get it up the stairs .
796889:15	I think somebody must have told him .
796916:14	So what he had to do , the the the the customer in fact , is end up by climbing up the bannister to get to the top so that he could get hold of the lad that was at the top get hold of him by the feet and pull him upwards and over and er finally free the man at the bottom .
796955:24	I said Well , well they must be we 've got furniture .
796961:18	I said Well it must be if it 's to twenty three .
797028:48	I was sweating , you could imagine thinking God we 're going to have to take the wheels off and drag it through with a tractor or something like that on skids , cos we needed the van for Monday and there was n't going to be a lot of t But then suddenly yes a again I suddenly th
797066:54	But if we were doing as we do a lot of jobs like that and I had to go round and estimate every one it would cost me more to go round and estimate than it would to do the jobs .
797144:34	But if you send an estimate you more or less have to say what you 're moving as well because if there 's more than that and you do n't put down what you 're moving then you 're p stuck with the estimate really and in p practice that 's what usually happens , you give an estimate and then you do it for that price .
797154:125	So we went and had and there was a little space , you know normal bit bigger than average and a little hooked thing and it opened up and down came some steps and we went up with trepidation I must say .
797157:11	Cos we had to repack it you see because it was going to take a it was going to take probably not it was going to go right to the end with this lot on .
797173:145	So of course inevitably what happened is we got the house lot in just , took it to this place in Leeds , got finished with that load and back for four which is what the estimate had covered us for , and then we had to start all over again with what was in the garage .
797189:20	And that 's what he had to pay .
797385:17	I says Well I must admit it is yes I you know I He said I 'm going to get a policeman if you 're not careful .
797387:83	Well by this time it was ten to eight and I 'd got all these members were going to be outside , I was going to have to let them in and serve them and I was getting a bit frantic you see .
797408:10	He 'd have to t Cos you see there was no proof of ownership .
797414:62	If that man wants his furniture back and it is his , because it might not be , he 'll have to get a court order .
797428:9	And I had to have an address to send the bill for the storage , which I would send to her on account every three months .
797442:149	A fortnight later from Bradford , another set of solicitors rang up , explained that they understood the circumstances , said Look c could I hold the stuff there and what was I going to charge for the storage etcetera , er and they would be going to have to get an affidavit from this lady in Australia at some stage in order to give er him the chance to have the stuff back .
797458:47	In fact then he by that time he was living in Leeds , so he had to pay for the cost of removal from my store to Leeds .
797471:104	But my instructions for the lads have always been that if you go to a job for a lady particularly and then a man comes along and starts to get stroppy , you 'll have to explain to the lady you may have to leave it temporarily and go back .
797471:130	But my instructions for the lads have always been that if you go to a job for a lady particularly and then a man comes along and starts to get stroppy , you 'll have to explain to the lady you may have to leave it temporarily and go back .
797472:18	But we 've never quite had to do that .
797495:15	She said I must mention I 've had a few more deliveries from Ercol So we walked into the living room .
797511:21	And in this last day , she must have been camping about , I do n't know how , but somehow she was traversing I she probably did n't she was using the living room as a store , I could only think that , she could n't possibly live in it .
797512:9	And we had to shift this lot .
797534:10	That five-year-olds have to go for parties .
797536:14	Everything that she must have had in clothes she 'd kept .
797581:7	You have to do a Chinese walk like this with them with a man on the other side holding the box like this because there is n't the distance .
797644:24	And we 've not had I I must say that over the years I might have had two cases perhaps when there 's been a query with regard to that in terms of packing .
797691:48	. I remember one thing , talking about things falling out and one of We had to go and pick up erm er er There was a great business you know about these er what are they called these these games .
797700:42	And then of course they the the the fashion died out and the owner had to get his pool tables back .
797805:12	I 'm gonna have to draw it there cos I wanted to Like that .
797935:17	you 're going to have to erm
798003:13	You 're gonna have to look it up , you 're gonna find a
798040:12	I 'm gonna have to draw these with straight lines with a ruler it 's not gonna work is it ?
798087:7	That must be more than sixty three .
798260:36	If you 're gonna draw that graph up what will you have to do ?
798262:10	You 'd have to put it below .
798265:29	Right now I do n't wanna I 'm gonna have to push you along a bit to to erm make sure you get this done .
798302:7	You must get over this business
798344:55	But it w which will give you a better picture of this graph , but we gonna have to get a chunk on this .
798391:62	So you get things in there that have already been worked out for you so you do n't have to erm So minus three .
798544:16	And I think that has to be in our homes .
798555:12	It does n't have to in actual fact .
798592:47	They cost about we reckon seventeen to twenty five pounds to buy and they have to be fitted to a door one and three quarter inches thick .
798609:47	It 's very good if that , that 's in place , but you have to also make sure that the , the screws on the hinge side are fitted correctly as well .
798637:9	And you must have gone through in your own neighbourhood where you see papers sticking out of letter bo boxes , milk left on the front door step .
798653:34	The only window open was at the back , so I had to break into my own house through there , I managed it .
798678:27	But actually , even with an alarm system you must have gone through where you 've heard alarms ringing all day and nobody 's been .
798681:13	You do n't have to tell them your business , but what you do have to say is , I 've got an alarm system , an audible system , so bells only , if you hear it going off can you ring the home station ?
798681:48	You do n't have to tell them your business , but what you do have to say is , I 've got an alarm system , an audible system , so bells only , if you hear it going off can you ring the home station ?
798692:14	Now if you had to have all the locks changed in your house , that probably come out on an even .
798772:13	Now police forces have to grade their to to things , we get the immediate response , the nine nine nine calls , and then so on .
798773:137	Where beat officers come into play is where you 've got the non-urgent , what we call , the traffic , the non-urgent jobs , erm , where people can afford , maybe a couple of hours , it might be that they have to wait until the beat officer gets on duty could be a day or so 's time and they they do do an awful lot of work , and it 's an ongoing thing .
798774:170	Erm if you just liken it , I mean I was a beat officer here for eight years and the sorts of things that you 'd come on duty erm to see , are you may , you might get the nutty woman , who who er , you reoccur and you have to go and see her and you ge , erm , but all the shift members can then pass that to the beat officer .
798784:42	All this side of the road is one officer 's area that they have to cover on foot .
798793:10	We 'll have to .
798795:10	We 'll have to .
798824:21	I mean I can , have to say
798851:46	I , I , I have phoned the police on numerous occasions and I must say , there is n't a great deal of response .
798869:31	Unfortunately , every thing you do in police force has got to be
798878:21	sort of , the things that they have to do apart from fighting crime !
798892:17	Oh well , you 'll have to stake it out again .
798916:53	that well , maybe the officer , the local beat officer has got a problem estate that he has to pinpoint and has to be there , or an area where the crime is being committed to try and deal with
798916:65	that well , maybe the officer , the local beat officer has got a problem estate that he has to pinpoint and has to be there , or an area where the crime is being committed to try and deal with
798949:9	Cos you must have a local of crime prevention officer .
798950:7	There must be one somewhere .
799017:18	But with that , I have to stress , do not snap away merrily at all your valuables and then take your film into Boots or Supersnaps or whatever with all your details on it , because you do n't know who works there and who 's going to pick up that and .
799019:13	You 'll either have to use a polaroid instamatic camera and , or , go to a re a reputable photographer and make sure you get the negatives back .
799083:20	Can you imagine , we have to try and make out a picture of that !
799100:32	If the police ca n't do it then somebody else has got to !
799101:7	I must be
799139:20	And then , we then we have to trace .
799140:71	I mean , police stations regularly become full of stolen items and we 've got nowhere to put it , and we have to have these displays erm , where we try and and trace the owners , it 's a , a very difficult job , it 's a very time consuming job
799268:70	Now they 're not the easiest things to speak into because the noise volume of the traffic is quite horrendous so you have to shout .
799273:75	It 's a horrible experience because the the through traffic goes so fast erm , so anybody who actually does n't know quite what you have to do .
799278:52	If you 've got no choice but to get out and walk then you are gonna have to do that , and that 's all very well being a day like today , where it 's not pouring down with rain er , you 're not walking in a pitch black area , but if you do suddenly change that and you put it into those sort of , well that sort of scenario you 'll find it 's very , very , frightening .
799279:14	What we have to say is , straight from Essex Police if that happens to you , get out , wherever possible on the passenger 's side of the vehicle and then go to your nearest box and then you pick up the receiver and get through the police control room and they will ask you a series of questions , have you broken down ?
799288:26	If you are not , and I have to stress this very carefully then they will call the nearest available garage and the garage will come there very quickly and they will tow you off into the nearest exit and there they will leave you and that can cost you probably , in excess of ninety pounds .
799520:14	Yes I I must say that .
799722:36	No I mean I opened but I forgot I had to switch it on .
799961:12	You do n't have to .
800042:11	So that girl must have paid er twenty pounds for hers .
800048:10	Oh that must have been what it was then .
800092:22	Then erm you just so you have to make sure you keep .
800161:9	Does this have to be done writing it down ?
800167:10	we 'll have to take a , french kids and that talking
800202:59	a red light come on the back and when , and then when the and let them go , must of heard it , saw running and he 's
800203:17	er , he did n't have to pay did he ?
800220:110	I will go what I 'll do tomorrow is zip it in my inside pocket there and wire it and all you can see , that 's enough really you do n't have to ask
800327:32	I said well what did do n't you have to tell me ?
800329:41	So I did n't get to know what what they did n't have to tell
800336:10	We 'll have to get her a set of books .
800390:22	I hate to think what must be down there now .
800526:11	I 'll have to hurry up or you 'll get no dinner .
800538:15	Well we 'll just have to dig it up and put another one in
800556:9	So ours must have cost , I 'm sure that would cost them a lot more than thirty pounds cos it did n't it did n't say a wrought iron wheelbarrow or anything , it just said a wheelbarrow
800558:12	So we 'll have to get it
800581:12	Oh , you must have been able to squeeze half an hour some time or other .
800592:10	Well I have to go to the paper shop
800659:22	Well you 're going to have to because when I pay for a paper , I want it to be complete , so I want that piece and I want th that piece , no wait a minute , where is it ?
800667:18	Well , you 'll just have to tell them that it 's missing but when I 've paid for a newspaper I expect to get all the pieces that I 've paid for and I 've already paid for mine , so this I 'll take .
800777:9	Do n't have to work .
800874:12	Erm I had to go to Mr Walker 's to get this thing .
800924:30	When I have a conversation with you I have to write it down .
801111:32	Right people here at half past three , if I have to tell them about fooling about .
801168:7	You have to be quiet .
801309:10	Exactly you have to think a long time .
801328:45	It 's not that good , cos it 's either Final Fight you have to be or you can only pick out of and or it 's Final Fight guy where you can only be or Guy .
801491:18	That 's what they have to that 's what they they do
801611:7	I had to go to the doctor okay then .

801833:18	Dad , dad , Auntie has to go somewhere I do n't know where , but she just told me to call you cos it 's quarter past fifteen minutes past six or is it seven ?

805959:9	Does he have to pay for it now ?
805967:13	You should n't have to pay anyway should you ?

806464:208	Yeah it 's in there somewhere , and they 're complaining , you know the people who play golf , the golf club are complaining , and the , the Council are saying it 's the Southwold Council , so maybe it 's the Parish Council , they 're saying that er yes it 's our responsibility this club and we must look after it and we must find the culprits and so on , it 's in there somewhere cos I read it this morning
806474:13	No , they must own Southwold , Kessingland , Pakefield and straight into Lowestoft , all that
806524:89	Mind you there again it 's cheaper than it should be because we 're paying it on VAT , you know , it , er , they must think we 're fools
806539:10	Yeah it must of been a few they 'd got through
806580:7	It must cost them more in time in getting that penny out you know
806643:182	what she was getting at , she knew exactly what she was shopping for , she went into that shop , there was the list , it was handed in , I bet it took her less time to shop then , than it did later when she went shopping with a vague idea well I must n't forget this , I must n't forget that , but then the wandering around sort of oh that looks nice and I fancy that
806643:198	what she was getting at , she knew exactly what she was shopping for , she went into that shop , there was the list , it was handed in , I bet it took her less time to shop then , than it did later when she went shopping with a vague idea well I must n't forget this , I must n't forget that , but then the wandering around sort of oh that looks nice and I fancy that
806726:7	somebody must do them
806741:9	And you had to keep going , striving on
806791:28	take on that job , you do n't have to be erm somebody who has knowledge about cloth , about way , the way things are made , the sewing , alright , how close it 's sewn to the edge
806815:45	Yeah and convince you , if you pay more for it , it must be better , and it , that is n't always true either , usually is but not always
806843:61	as if you were something , somebody very special and again it 's a big con and it , they must think people fall for this
806846:19	and then they forget they have to pay for it
806974:22	are benefitting people who do n't have to , never had to scrat around
806974:34	are benefitting people who do n't have to , never had to scrat around
807029:7	they must rub their hands together you know when these booms are going , you know , oh as much money as you want
807030:11	because they must know what 's gonna happen when they , you know , when the cows come home , they must know when the chickens come home to roost they must know what 's gonna happen
807030:70	because they must know what 's gonna happen when they , you know , when the cows come home , they must know when the chickens come home to roost they must know what 's gonna happen

808348:31	well she brought the meal and she , she had to go miles to get the sauce , did n't she ?
808809:22	And supposing it melts and we have to
809039:10	All you have to do is put the chicken carcass in and leave it
809136:60	She was always clean , you could n't fault her for cleanliness , but I 'm sure she must of either washed her clothes in the toilets , you know , wash basin in the toilets because that was the only thing she had was one bag and she used to , er , her pension book was in and er erm
809260:43	by er , mind you they 'd always been children that had had to fend for themselves a lot , the only sad thing
809267:50	Mm , she worked and she worked night shift as well , you know they had to do alternative shifts , so consequently
809272:65	I mean Margaret used to come in and everything was done for her , I mean she never had to do a thing well that hit her terribly you see .
809394:7	He must of been feeling unwell then
809404:32	and I said oh there 's Benjy , there must be something , you know , I thought it was one of the kids that had jumped or something because the little one had always climbing and jumping off the wall , breaking his leg you know the weak one , and the next minute saw the ambulance outside , but he must of been , it must of been too massive to be able to do anything cos he was n't breathing that bit you see
809404:191	and I said oh there 's Benjy , there must be something , you know , I thought it was one of the kids that had jumped or something because the little one had always climbing and jumping off the wall , breaking his leg you know the weak one , and the next minute saw the ambulance outside , but he must of been , it must of been too massive to be able to do anything cos he was n't breathing that bit you see
809404:205	and I said oh there 's Benjy , there must be something , you know , I thought it was one of the kids that had jumped or something because the little one had always climbing and jumping off the wall , breaking his leg you know the weak one , and the next minute saw the ambulance outside , but he must of been , it must of been too massive to be able to do anything cos he was n't breathing that bit you see

809938:7	They have to
809943:15	But she , she had to have two because the , the first one they did it was n't , it was n't exactly what they wanted
809945:9	so she had to go back in and have it done again

810674:93	What 's happening with Philip I do n't know whether Philip will be able I think what we 'll have to do is one of us will have to drive the Metro
810698:10	I it has got to go
810936:10	I 'll have to have a
811044:161	For how many years have we been told it 's tax payers ' money do you remember Maggie and the tax payers ' money , it 's like this animal somewhere called the tax payer but it came out of the wall as if we were n't one of them and that we had to look after the tax payers ' money .
811338:10	oh , must find this seat belt ca ca n't find it wo n't go in it 's flashing at me saying I have n't got my seat belt , but I have or and we 'll go off to Southwold
811362:62	Erm , we 're there we 're sorting that out the other thing is you see grandma will have to go shopping tomorrow .
811365:23	So you 'll ha she 'll have to get this her supplies in her provisions .
811434:34	So he might get his wall built but he might have to wait a year before he starts it .
811478:73	And if you 're not satisfied with what is happening or not happening you should say something but grandma insists that she must n't upset
811480:4	must n't upset the doctors
811561:7	You have to pay for half of the upkeep of the roads .
812085:29	First thing she said was I 'll have to get my
812089:8	I had to get four pints of milk , you know oh honestly
812149:7	She must have shares in Daisy !
812158:34	there 's hardly enough for two in and then she has to do another two only , only she ca n't pour it in after it 's .
812274:7	You have to take that off do n't you ?
812349:4	have to keep it up .
812351:9	And you had to keep up with their er thinking tactics .
812411:9	but you must do .
812458:15	because er you 'll have to get mother settled
812770:19	Did you say you have to have
812811:10	We 'll have to make a word
812822:7	You must capitulate the word so yeah , surrender 's right .
813415:17	One of you will have to come with me .
813422:4	has to have pick a cushion off , off the floor .
813427:68	Well it will be upstairs cos there 's a pillow up no , no , hey listen he complained because he had to step over the pillow , that 's it !
813432:46	Well at your age you should have a hankie with you , you should n't have to be told !
813434:14	But you do n't have to be told to put your socks on do you ?
813438:49	Then if you both want to go to the hospital you ca n't somebody will have to be either graciously accept to go over and get the bedroom sorted
813689:35	But they they , that was n't accurate because it has to go up , to have fifteen kilometres a second .
813793:14	No , all they have to do once they 've found one new cure for cancer
813801:43	If they find a cure for say , lung cancer they 'll just have to chase just a tiny bit and they will do cancer .
813892:9	And he has to contact the doctor ?
813979:10	I 'll have to .
814008:44	So re I explained about father and he said you know , we must get together .
814032:25	Well let 's hope we do n't have to go back !
814082:16	and now he 'll have to change his ways and he 'll have to take her shopping .
814082:40	and now he 'll have to change his ways and he 'll have to take her shopping .
814098:42	She does , and then it just fades into the background she will have to go if she needs to get bread and milk and things tomorrow I 'll have to take her .
814098:92	She does , and then it just fades into the background she will have to go if she needs to get bread and milk and things tomorrow I 'll have to take her .
814341:10	Hey , must of ee ee , wha what 's it like ?
814453:13	Oh I 'll have to take that tomorrow .
814628:13	with her she had to learn
814674:130	In this month , mind you we 've used this one most Today she was saying , had n't Tony decided which school he was going to and then she started which school should he go to , will you have to pay ?
814699:14	because it would have to of been H reg would n't it ?
814911:31	No it does n't , he , he does n't have to follow his brother 's footsteps
815091:18	and then I 'll only have to carry forward of about three thousand , plus me twelve thousand deposit

824932:54	I 'd be alright as long as I could go on a route where all I had to do was turn left but as soon as I turn right
824937:21	I think you 'll just have to move your house so you just have to do a couple of miles .
824937:46	I think you 'll just have to move your house so you just have to do a couple of miles .

825587:7	We have got to .
825641:22	I taped Louise and and they had to be .
825700:53	That 's why I put you down the end of the table so I would n't have to talk to you .
825912:27	And we hardly got in and then you have to
825915:7	I must start using the library .

826547:16	I 'm , they must think I 'm so thick !
826582:10	You 'll have to take mum out for a nice Indian once she feels better .
826599:100	Cos he 's quite good in a , but it 's so easy to get wrapped up with , obviously at that age it 's very impressionable and very like they , they must look so big to a lot of people that they go out
826636:25	I think the teachers are gonna have to be there .
826651:25	I think they 're just gonna have to be really , really strict with them .
826713:7	She must have been away so we took flight .
826745:11	Oh you have to go back down there and turn er , left underneath , underneath the motorway .
826746:77	But , when we came back , yes , there 's a sign there , but it did n't tell you the other side , you have to come
826748:7	You have to lose your way , come back , yeah .
826756:31	I went across and yes it 's , you have to go back er a a a again , and when the road narrows , just after the , the , the narrow in the road , you take the first left .
826773:27	And how bi , quite big , it must be quite big .
826779:31	the th , the , the Thames in fact , must go underneath .
826798:20	all yo , if the clients had to pay for anything it would be for one newspaper and one telephone call home that was all .
826853:110	Oh it was when we were gonna go to the cinema and I phoned Marion and I said no , I really cannot be bothered , it 's just pouring down with rain , had to
826913:10	We 'll have to make a booking .

827065:15	I suppose they must put these in the the oven I would
827134:52	Erm , I , I wa , when I get into work on Monday I 'll have to find out .
827391:7	We had to like tell her about five times so they knew it was n't our room as we like took this guy in it was like books , everything was , there was so much crap on the floor , we had to get through to get to the radiator so that our next door neighbour could try and like stop it from leaking .
827391:136	We had to like tell her about five times so they knew it was n't our room as we like took this guy in it was like books , everything was , there was so much crap on the floor , we had to get through to get to the radiator so that our next door neighbour could try and like stop it from leaking .
827410:13	Yes you 'd have to be
827444:55	Cut leg cos he 'd kicked a car and his leg was all bleeding so he had to
827484:41	So we thought I , so we said look , we 're gonna have to break it down .
827591:15	No , I 'll have to give it to you .
827690:12	So you really have to have a sort of strong character and in you go .
827877:11	Does everybody have to be in their studies at quiet time ?
827879:9	No everyone has to be in
828013:7	It must be six fifteen .
828047:24	I just love the way that kid must 've been standing out there for what , fifteen minutes ?
828058:24	He is lovely er er he must be in Duncan 's er what house is Duncan in ?
828317:15	I suppose it must be quite hard , if you do n't teach someone you just like have to shout at them , I dunno .
828317:58	I suppose it must be quite hard , if you do n't teach someone you just like have to shout at them , I dunno .
828391:131	and she seems really full of herself and I bet you , I mean come on I 'm sure if there , if there was a master like a sports bloke like that you might be s it 's like there must be some
828392:7	There must be some people that fancy her actually
828600:16	I suppose you must have sport and everything else too , you must do .
828600:41	I suppose you must have sport and everything else too , you must do .
828618:158	Not really , I mean well I know , German I mean I 'm gonna be worried about it when I get there but at the moment German and French are just gonna be translating something , there 'll be , give me an extract and a translation and I 'll have to do them , you know
828622:24	There 's not really that much you have to know .
828623:27	I mean maybe with politics you 'll have to know .
828666:25	I 'm so pleased we do n't have to sleep in here .
828703:65	Yeah , so you see the few selected ones that come from other schools and you instantly assume that their school must be much more er much better looking than ours .
828774:204	because of a girl , I really think he 's loyal in that way , in that sense , because they are very close they have a laugh and I know when we 're with them they 're always like seem to be impressing everyone but I 'm sure when they 're together they have like , you know , human conversations , they must do , they ca n't always be talking about screwing and you know , which girls have got big tits and all that
828810:65	Erm I felt really organized cos Mr said that I was too hyperactive and I needed to have , I had to do something constructive so he sent me out posting well giving everyone their letters and I felt really I mean he did n't do it nastily , he just said I was flitting about and needed something to do and so it was really fun .
829099:11	If you have to translate any of these , when as soon as after
829137:18	Right , what do I have to do ?
829308:7	You must have driving instructors there .
829364:10	And we had to go and do the washing up and they were sitting in the erm in the kitchen choosing their Christmas presents from the Argos catalogue oh that 's nice , ooh it 's five ninety nine Jenny I 'm serious .
829610:12	You do n't have to listen to it !
829665:9	No you must find out for us which is the one to go to .
829790:10	We 'll have to teach him .
829828:10	I 'd have to say that you
829842:25	Well did I tell you we had to do this , I did tell you , we had to do this erm competition ?
829842:58	Well did I tell you we had to do this , I did tell you , we had to do this erm competition ?
829844:20	Dra er some of us had to do a drama competition
829942:27	Pete , Pete would yeah Pete would have to get off with you and Charlie did it .
829960:10	Well you must have left but then the bet was if Charlie could do it and do something like splits in the middle or something , ca n't remember what it was , then I w
829961:12	Pete Pete would have to go out with you .
830065:25	yeah in the same respect you should n't have to think that every time someone says they fancy you , you should n't have to think , you know , that it 's a joke at all .
830065:72	yeah in the same respect you should n't have to think that every time someone says they fancy you , you should n't have to think , you know , that it 's a joke at all .
830072:14	No you do n't have to be horrible you just have to go up and say make the point that
830072:35	No you do n't have to be horrible you just have to go up and say make the point that
830091:21	Well yeah but they do n't have to like pull you through it as well .
830160:175	Ed was just like a one off and I 'm not forward any more at all and , you know , everyone thinks I am you know and Pete thought right I 'm in for a good time here , you know , I can probably get her you know , and so Charlie would have to carry out his part .
830287:123	My parents are going to France at Christmas and erm I do n't wanna go with them really and nor does Digby so he , Digby 's gonna come and stay just for a bit and my house it has to be empty and Foxy 's coming round to stay .
830423:24	set up a little business and they have to pay us and then we 'll
830431:131	He had this really nice cap and it was a really smart cap , I just really liked it and he was a bit of an ugly , well he was n't ugly he was just really gormless and I said erm he must have been about twenty something and I said to him can I have your hat , he said no it 's from a friend , it 's sentimental or something
830439:235	it was n't good because erm I did n't love him and right so , so if I kissed him and met him the next day would I , would I snog , would , would he , he 'd give me the hat so I said yeah sure , you know , whatever , so he goes okay and he like prepared himself and goes no I ca n't do it in here and so I had to go outside with him , snog him , got his hat and pissed off , never saw him again .
830559:7	Somebody must have one .

834977:16	blocked off , he had to
835014:89	They said they said oh there 's no beds left at all , there 's probably about ten and the there was a bed , then I had to wait till about half past three in the afternoon to get into it .
835029:12	And , they had to pull everything up and she was n't very pleased about it .
835035:76	Erm , and Chris had a look at it and said it 's not the phone it 's your line , so she had to have the , the G P O people in .
835036:22	Erm and then of course they had to haul up the floorboards and re re-lay a line for the phone
835058:28	Well yo you could , but you 'd have to have erm
835065:59	pull it up , well they might leave it and just co disconnect it but they they 'd have to bring it in , I do n't it 'd be better I think if we had ours in the back because the , the telephone thing comes in from the back be better than having it in the , in the passage really .
835090:10	You 'll have to get into bed .
835130:61	Er , she said , you know , make it one to sort of so you do n't have to come back .

836317:30	Your Mum ca n't afford toilet paper , she has to slide down the banisters .
836330:8	He has to stick his head up and go where the fuck has it gone ?
836335:7	They must be very small .
836343:7	She has to cut hairs off of your dolls and stick it on with Sellotape !
836406:7	You must have touched her up the wrong way .

837081:12	I do n't have to speak because they 're all waiting for me .
837097:12	You do n't have to say that but we all you know you 're you 're pulling their leg the whole time okay ?
837451:14	Sir will we have to know ?
837470:12	You do n't have to put L with the commas do you ?
837515:12	You do n't have to say that ever really .
837691:23	Nothing in between you do n't have to revise , even if you know next week I may I do n't know , I may ask you to get on with unit seven .
837751:9	No Steven has to be deaf with ears like that .
837883:7	That must have been a horrendous death for some of them
837889:7	You have to put them all in a s in there
837934:115	Still was n't enough goals though even if Poland had beaten Holland , England still would n't have qualified because they needed , because er the opposition got a goal , they need to be , they had to win by seven clear goals so that meant they had to win eight one , not seven one , you see .
837934:149	Still was n't enough goals though even if Poland had beaten Holland , England still would n't have qualified because they needed , because er the opposition got a goal , they need to be , they had to win by seven clear goals so that meant they had to win eight one , not seven one , you see .
837938:90	That 's the end of the game , that 's the end of it because on on erm once h Holland needed to lose right , they had to lose , Holland , and er Poland needed to beat Holland and England had to win by a seven goal majority I E seven nil or eight one , seven one would n't have been enough even if Holland had lost
837938:135	That 's the end of the game , that 's the end of it because on on erm once h Holland needed to lose right , they had to lose , Holland , and er Poland needed to beat Holland and England had to win by a seven goal majority I E seven nil or eight one , seven one would n't have been enough even if Holland had lost
837940:7	It had to be eight one you see
837943:17	If Holland , Holland had to lose , that was the that was the deciding factor
837953:7	It must 've been pr
838059:19	I suppose it 's must have been re re-opened or opened newly opened and they 're all well wishers that send flowers you see
838068:22	Yes we do actually , just have to er , the difficulty is teaching the girls how to use that machine properly
838134:145	Yeah , and there 's another couple of guys and they were saying that how strict the training was when they first took it on you know that the their masters used to beat them and everything , into submission , s said they had to have complete submission before they could train them to be what they were , you know , bring them up , teach them and train them
838226:7	It must 've been a belt that 's come right through central London and completely missed the suburbs , or North London anyway suburbs
838307:56	When you ca n't do the time , do n't do the crime turn to criminology you must be prepared to accept the punishment when they get caught
838328:18	This is where you have to be aware of black ice you see
838337:7	There must 've been a little bit of snow
838525:98	All of a sudden there 's the snow and the ice and when we pulled into the village they got this fl flat roof some of the buildings and the snow must have been about ten twelve feet deep on top of the roofs where they cut a path through through to get to the village .
838597:60	You do n't need a licence you see on private ground to drive a car , you do n't have to be a certain age either .
838606:7	Yeah must be really good the thing that I really want to do in the Christmas holiday is go-carting
838857:131	The moon is that much further away from the sea on this side so that 'd have that much less of an effect holding the sea water down on to the earth and therefore the sea water comes Now obviously the water from the high tide has got to come from somewhere so they 'll be some parts of the globe low tide .
838982:9	D' ya have to draw this ?
839104:68	Yeah well I 'll ask I 'll ask my mum but if I if I did n't I 'm gonna have to get perhaps
839179:12	You do n't have to hold like that you can hold it
839432:12	Shit it must be quite a little thing if it can only hear your voice .
839726:10	Well they must be at that age .
839792:7	You have to have evidence
839810:18	Yeah I know they must be they must have been provoked or

862785:9	Well it had to I suppose .
862787:9	Well you had to , to go then ?
862802:9	Someone else must be going .
862867:8	We had to work ourselves , we did the parrot sketch .
862868:7	We had to write up the parrot sketch in English and this French translated in French for us .
862873:9	So I have to go upstairs then ?
863099:34	But ee , if Miss comes in I do n't have to do it , I just hand it over to Miss and bugger off .
863282:41	No , on the letter though it did say er wha no I had to ring Sasha you know .
863299:7	They must use a .
863402:10	We only have to walk down
863471:63	Cos I do n't wanna make a big thing of it cos if it was today we 'd have to go before Sesame Street or after the Sesame Street .
863495:74	And go I 'm a bit shy you see , erm well I 'm a bit shy and tell the truth I have to admit I 'm a bit shy so , I when I come on I 'm gonna say hello and then you say hello back to me .
863497:16	And then , no one has to be shy .
863552:34	I did n't have time to talk cos I had to be here for nine .
863618:46	and you 'd fit them together but if it did n't fit you 'd have to do something to you 'd have to get them from som , from somewhere else .
863618:72	and you 'd fit them together but if it did n't fit you 'd have to do something to you 'd have to get them from som , from somewhere else .
863684:15	See what I have to put up with ?
863692:11	We 'll have to knuckle down a bit wo n't we se Rachel ?
863837:7	I must give you one and take it for her .
863964:15	I thought you had to be quite careful with chicken .
863972:10	I 'll have to try that one in , in Dublin , tell Molly I 've been .
864114:27	I 'm looking forward to the sweet I must
864243:7	He must be running low .
864300:9	So she must have been quite young herself then ?
864387:30	That she would n't say anything so , Dorothy had to actually say erm well I really do n't think you should go for that .
864458:17	tape or you really have to wipe it out .
864480:7	He must have heard that I 'd come back from Ireland .
864626:9	So I had to lie .
864670:26	I felt sorry for him but I must admit when I got home and the following morning , and since then I 've felt quite angry about it .
864869:10	I 'll have to do it
864873:22	Yes , cos I 'm gonna have to make up some
864898:7	I must say you
864911:15	Well you 'll just have to change it when you leave .
864926:10	I 'll have to say I 'm Rachel because our voices sound the same .
865014:34	No , I think there 's some people you have to be very blunt to .
865296:35	If any force guides the universe , universe , it surely must be love .
865321:10	You will have to spend a lot of time preventing tricky scenarios from getting any worse or keeping antagonistic individuals apart .
865404:9	But you have to look at th , his trousers , the last man .
865567:22	She 's go , she 'll have to go back behind the scenes and chat the other two up .
865634:66	And he did n't know where the Em , he did n't know where the Emerald Isles was last week , he had to ask .
865927:21	I 'd say we 'll have to do more than that , I 'd say we 'll have to go down for a week .
865927:60	I 'd say we 'll have to do more than that , I 'd say we 'll have to go down for a week .
865966:28	Yes it would be really , you 'd have to employ the staff over there as well .
866085:9	Then I had to come back and read Shakespeare .
866094:21	How much of Shakespeare do you have to do or do you have to do it all ?
866094:39	How much of Shakespeare do you have to do or do you have to do it all ?
866095:15	You ca n't possibly have to do it all do you ?
866100:12	But you you must prefer one over the others do you ?
866116:19	How much teaching practice do you have to do ?
866151:92	The reasoning behind that is that come from a lower class generally if you ca n't you know you ca n't go to a nursery school cos you have to pay for nursery school education in this country .
866178:10	Well you have to travel by car to the station .
866240:70	And we 'd go to the theatre or but I mean we do all that sort of thing still but we just have to cram it into the week .
866247:7	You must open it .
866269:12	Mm do you have to take them off every time you wash it ?
866328:34	No she still buys smooth erm I remember I must have been about three years old , it was when we were still up North and mummy was dashing out , it was breakfast time and she go easy on the peanut butter , there 's hardly any left .
866369:7	This must be nearly Oh no it 's ten .
866410:68	And you know from as soon as he could walk it was explained to him you know , that you must walk and not and
866456:46	But I think she 's doing a good job of bringing Thomas up I must say . .
866468:37	And erm and she says you know well she just has to do what she has to do he can go to school and but she 'll just have to make do on you know , what money she has .
866468:57	And erm and she says you know well she just has to do what she has to do he can go to school and but she 'll just have to make do on you know , what money she has .
866468:97	And erm and she says you know well she just has to do what she has to do he can go to school and but she 'll just have to make do on you know , what money she has .
866480:10	We 'd have to keep
866482:10	We 'd have to keep the outside as is , it would always have to have two front doors .
866482:45	We 'd have to keep the outside as is , it would always have to have two front doors .
866487:22	I mean the whole thing would have to be redesigned .
866492:19	What yo you would have to do a a lot of remodelling downstairs because t there 's no point having two kitchens .
866518:26	Well er I mean eventually we 'd have to think of something .
866530:13	Well we 'd have to divest ourselves of some of our assets .
866705:102	Erm , with his brother I think from Hemel Hempstead , erm , and a lot of pub conversations , in a pub called The Lion in Croydon , with erm , I think it must be an ex-girlfriend .
866745:130	Well , if you do n't want them on , that 's the whole problems of obviously saying , erm , in fact , we do n't , if we do n't want them on a disk at all , we do n't have to have them .
866777:96	If you think that this assignment is , is sort of preferable to the ones that you 've been looking , you could all choose this one , you 'll have to do some recording like the others on your own machines , but you could
866783:98	Listen , listen very carefully shh , because this is important to get right , erm , because the assign because the assignments are part of your degree mark , and have to go to the external examiner , and has to be monitored etcetera etcetera etcetera , it 's all quite formal and so we do need to get this right .
866783:121	Listen , listen very carefully shh , because this is important to get right , erm , because the assign because the assignments are part of your degree mark , and have to go to the external examiner , and has to be monitored etcetera etcetera etcetera , it 's all quite formal and so we do need to get this right .
866790:13	You do n't have to , but supposing you all choose this .
867022:10	You may have to do it in longhand .
867030:9	Do you have to type the essay ?
867031:42	Preferably yes , it 's much easier to mark it , and I must say , research , research shows , that a clearly typed essay does tend to get a better mark .
867046:12	Would you still have to mention things like eye contact and gesture , and that ?
867265:7	You have to the get mattress out urgh , it 's awful .
867353:12	I 'm gonna have to scrub all this bit , now .
867365:24	What I keep saying , we must , we must get to know her better .
867365:32	What I keep saying , we must , we must get to know her better .
867366:7	We must n't
867395:56	Nick , now , I have n't got Charlotte ' s number , so you 're gonna have to
867462:9	Five fifty must be students , eight fifty must be
867462:30	Five fifty must be students , eight fifty must be
867483:35	I know it 's new , but you do n't have to be scared of it .
867600:4	have to start making guesses when I can smell it .
867778:21	Ca n't be a quarter , must be a month , surely .
867807:54	bill for the quarter between the second of August and the twentieth of September , and he had to pay seven quid for standing charges for that bill .
867809:12	And we 've had to pay it for from the twentieth of September to the eighth of October .
867811:12	So we 've had to pay another seven quid something .
868005:78	Right , because in there , if you pay fifteen pounds , you get erm , you get tickets for , you know you only have to pay four pounds , plus you get half price tickets for
868087:7	You have to swing your bottom , papa ?
868098:17	Literally , and then you have to sit there with this cream on , and it 's all very fiddly and messy and it smells .
868249:8	I have to say , that compared to other chairs ,
868302:88	It depends on your lifestyle you live , though , cos I got friends who are just like ah , I do n't like and you have to excuse my hairy legs running or something , I mean , I just like they 're like this , and they 've got like black hair about this long , and I 'm like oh my God , oh my God , you 're just like
868432:44	And reading those terrible things , that you 're for dead , and you have to get up at so many different times .
868452:18	Oh dear , we 'll have to do something about this .
868500:55	their parents , but it 's like when they 're modelling in their bikini and they have to go , oh , I love the environment and erm , I support this charity , thank you very much , and I love world , and that 's it .
868524:7	I must admit .
868568:31	quite a good idea , like free , if you had to erm , speak to a teddy bear
868691:95	Somebody once said to me they think it 's really rude if they did n't bring wine to a , to a dinner party and then they do n't have to have to drink it .
868691:102	Somebody once said to me they think it 's really rude if they did n't bring wine to a , to a dinner party and then they do n't have to have to drink it .
868704:19	Would you think , I have to open Charlotte 's first , because they brought it ,
868733:17	I hate that I must say .
868817:7	You have to buy seven yoghurts so then you can take your car
868834:20	I just , I just have got to the stage now where I 've been er , I ca n't remember it 's five or six times , and I think , I 'm not going to get any better .
868845:53	Well , I think the thing for me is I do n't feel like I have to look brilliant , I just like to have a good time .
868872:30	I think when you go skiing , you must go with a with a group of erm , group of people .
868906:15	Really all we 'd have to pay for is the fuel and the lift pass .
868914:10	You only have to rebind ' em .
868934:17	So when my dad had to ski all the way down to the bottom , while I 'm sitting on the side of this bloody slide .
868977:9	so I had to lie down properly and crawl over the top of it .
869023:12	So you 'll have to go back out and do that grinding
869063:13	Why does it have to be tall , that 's what I want to know ?
869064:7	It has to be tall to really taste nice .
869103:7	He must be alive
869117:14	Actually , I have to say , we got it first , it 's one of those , I think it 's corny , you know when you do something first , and everybody else seems to suddenly do it , and they come round , and say , that 's really a good idea , and like , everybody comments on our coffee grinder and since we come to like , the church , like , practically everybody in the church has now got a coffee grinder .
869158:7	I must say I had a big shock when I married Nick .
869166:7	Ben had to go to a brea a housebreak on the site .
869170:7	I had to stay there .
869174:62	It was a Sunday , I was so worried , I did n't know anything about , and I just have to sit there and we had to make conversation .
869174:82	It was a Sunday , I was so worried , I did n't know anything about , and I just have to sit there and we had to make conversation .
869255:9	Do n't have to get up now .
869321:24	So you think , and so people must like do this , and then phone back , I 'm sure it 's not just me , because I ca n't be that thick .
869389:10	It would have to be really
869443:84	and you go up this thing that winds in and out and like there 'd be cockerels sitting on the , on the little fences you have to go round , trying to peck you to death , er I was like only tiny , you know , it was just like
869446:49	But I just used to have this dream , of all these animals , and I had to go in with all these animals , it was actually full , crammed full of animals , that were all out to eat me , and , kill me ,
869560:10	We 'll have to get a tablecloth .
869564:7	You have to have a lot of sleep .
869611:14	and when I have to get up , I have to get up .
869611:32	and when I have to get up , I have to get up .
869662:7	They must have a sprung floor , or something .
869753:9	Do you have to pay for your T V licence plus all the other flats separately ?
869756:12	We do n't have to pay for ours .
869758:29	But I mean , per household , do you have to pay ?
869866:16	I mean , that must be a thousand pounds ' worth of air tickets .
869922:9	The bath must be the size of a sofa .
869929:9	Do you have to embarrass your parents bathroom .
869978:7	I have to stick to my guns , I 'm paying a fortune for this stuff , why should I have faulty
870057:11	because they have to pay , sort of , two or three percent on
870091:19	cos I mean , I had to help my dad with a car boot sale , this is a man who does n't buy anything erm , secondhand
870115:12	So you really have to keep an eye out .
870133:13	You 'll just have to
870153:9	Do you have to do all this from the tapes that have been recorded .
870158:23	Plus , all us , we had to do erm , transcribe five minutes .
870254:98	Actually , I I want , do n't know whether you want interested in coming , I 'm not sure whether I wanna go , but either next week , it 'll have to be next week , ' cos I think after I wo n't be here , I 'm going home .
870300:14	So , so they had to do it .
870307:12	Yeah , we had to call it , Lear 's Lily
870319:9	So you had to ask actual
870359:9	Would you have to go to university .
870521:12	Well , it must be pretty soon .
870580:45	I love it when they start talking , in the street , they have to sort of , adapt to it , do n't they ?
870647:70	describe it , it was brown , it had like red in it as well and it was so curly , it must have been natural .
870766:27	Well , you never know , you might have to study it then for the exams .
870767:33	Yeah , I suppose I might , if I have to .
870768:92	One of the girls , today , she wasn ' say she was n't sure , but she was saying that she heard that perhaps the exam structure you have to incorporate all three phases of the
870784:32	The whole point of tea , is that it has to brew , is n't it .
870875:13	You do n't have to , but we live here .
871001:7	It has to be not too strong and not too weak .
871013:43	So I decided to give up one sugar and you know , I have to take it sort of weak weaker anyway .
871150:77	she says she reckons that it 's Scottish , it 's a Scottish brand , but you know , I do n't think it must be .
871191:31	Oh , what a pain in the arse , you have to go downstairs .
871222:88	Made two , erm , cooked two eggs , and it lasted me two days , whereas you know , usually if I go downstairs , I do n't have to make anything , because all their pre-prepared anyway .
871343:33	, that 's hard work , you know , you have to prepare all that veg , and
871350:20	I mean , you just have to control it ,
871361:9	everything else has to be thrown out .
871377:57	and it 's a much better system , overall , which is , you know , you do n't have to ring up some many different people every week .
871559:20	I did n't know you had to pay if you cancelled a cheque ?
871587:17	Oh , I still have to cancel that cheque , yeah .
871684:12	You do n't have to change the subject .
871790:45	and it was all split up into the different seminar group , we we had to take one aspect .
871842:13	So I 've had to come down and
871932:7	I had to do Valponi as well , which is one of these other ones .
872076:116	There was two thousand pound , Second World War bomb , they found in Walton , which is right near the River Thames which is , like , past Hampton Court , and Mike said that he 'd have to go out there today , and it 's er erm , this guy who he works for , owns a Leisure Centre right beside where this bomb is .
872077:39	So he 'll need to go down there with his associates and had to evacuate the Leisure Centre .
872182:31	Hampstead , erm , round Hampstead , round Highgate , had to drive up there , it 's so nice .
872388:19	So like , I did n't have to be there for the phone at all .
872396:30	Yeah , Annette was hoping that she would n't have to work on Sunday .
872442:12	Well , they have to correspond to the lecture , so the lecture this week was , world population .
872449:14	And then , you have to get to about three to four articles on that .
872454:31	World population , erm probably what I 'm gonna have to do is , although they , they said you ca n't do it do n't get any ideas about doing it with because it 's not possible .
872457:46	cos if I find that I ca n't find something , I 'll just have to look like
872487:12	Well , I must ad I 'll probably end up going down there , and getting the
872581:95	I could have done with it , I could n't get on the bloo they got this internal bus service that runs from each college , cos you have to go to the other colleges for your lectures , and I just sort , there 's not enough , and you , you get turned away , and I just thought , I went for that bus Tuesday morning , I was supposed to get it at eight fifteen , and he just said sorry , no more room .
872607:12	Yeah , I have to .
872618:8	They must say , God they must get pissed off with it , so I 've already looked around , and there 's loads of parking places ,
872618:24	They must say , God they must get pissed off with it , so I 've already looked around , and there 's loads of parking places ,
872627:9	So we had to wait for the next bus , which was six o' clock .
872637:70	See that 's the thing , if I wanna go and do my studying , I ca n't just go , I have to and , and dinner starts at erm , if I 've got a lecture , my lecture is sort of one o' clock .
872644:10	So I have to get a bit , er jump on the bus , and then erm , either get something to eat at their college , but then , by that time , you see , cos dinner starts at quarter to twelve , it 's all gone .
872652:115	So , it 's , alright it 's not a major problem , but that 's the only difficulty with it is it 's not , it 's good having the bus service where you do n't have to pay , right , if you do n't , like I did n't realize the bus went at five past one , and I was all ready to go , and er , it was ten past one , and I thought , oh no , so I had to wait till three o' clock .
872652:259	So , it 's , alright it 's not a major problem , but that 's the only difficulty with it is it 's not , it 's good having the bus service where you do n't have to pay , right , if you do n't , like I did n't realize the bus went at five past one , and I was all ready to go , and er , it was ten past one , and I thought , oh no , so I had to wait till three o' clock .
872890:64	He said , whereas my mum over there in the corner , he said , if she had a bash I had to listen to bloody Frank Sinatra , would n't I ?
873053:33	I think she 's somebody that just like , has to go with the flow , with what her friends are doing , and all her friends back home are really seriously into them .
873085:7	You have to go and knock on her door , cos she ca n't hear you shouting .
873095:17	Great big coat on , must have been sweating her eyeballs out .
873195:11	Cos he has to have it undercut , cos that 's hard .
873339:79	We were walk walking to erm the , down the high street and a plane went over , and erm , I think mum must have been saying to her about Aunty Jill being on holiday , and she went , ah , there 's Aunty Jill in the plane going to the city .
873379:13	What 's it have to drink ?
873389:25	you 've done it , she 's had to get out and put it on herself .
873395:20	Yeah , I suppose she has to be with Ryan
873503:7	You have to look up every second word .
873532:35	Either other areas where it 's very specialized and you had to look up words , or other difficulties with the
873575:39	It 's supposed to be a play , I suppose you have to watch it .
873632:26	With the amount of my money all this must .
873699:42	So in a very different world to that of Shakespearean comedy , a must harsher abrasive world erm again th that bit where she 's ge get , do I get the impression that most of you found yours much more difficult to get into
873750:151	One day , when he is , somewhere back in act two , one day he is visiting the alchemist he catches sight of this woman , Doll , quite obviously a prostitute , probably an a an absolutely erm catches sight of her and says , I must quickly think up some reason why this woman is , is in the house cos Sir Epicure Manhom thinks the alchemist is a pure , homely er priest-like creature yet in fact , he 's running a whorehouse .
873806:30	I think one of you lot 's gonna have to go over and join these three over here .
873843:7	It must be some .
874120:29	Say so , I mean you do n't have to do this .
874378:16	Because we do n't have to see him .
874392:7	Definitely have to demonstrate .
874546:10	I 'll have to go and get some and put it up .
874550:25	I ca n't move so it 'll have to
874575:35	Now , look , she , there 's something she has to talk to you about and
874576:29	I 'm not gonna say she 'll have to tell you afterwards , you know what I mean ?
874578:10	she 'll have to tell you .
874580:27	She is gonna come back , she had to go and
874858:10	You 'll have to all go this week anyway I do n't want
874938:12	Well you 'll have to move the chair forward a bit .
874965:22	Do you know how long Daddy has to work ?
875020:53	And er , he yeah , yeah he told me he could play basket ball it must be right cos he 's got a nice chest and he went what ?
875096:16	Yes , so you have to put a lot of , like , mousse on or make it wet , no not wet , it stings
875304:39	When he found out his daughter had a stroke he had to come from America and look after her and like then , from then on , he was just like , had that money in the bank , really .
875308:62	I do n't think so she 's erm slow , she 's , she 's like erm , she has to go to a special school
875344:11	What I have to do on chapter .
875376:7	I have to get , I have to get people 's conversations .

878748:66	I ai n't been to no doctor 's , well I 'm lying I had to go again , I had to like because I 've been getting these here bloody , I must 've had them ten or fifteen year or more and , cos I 'm on these here tablets now for the old stomach like , and that like .
878748:106	I ai n't been to no doctor 's , well I 'm lying I had to go again , I had to like because I 've been getting these here bloody , I must 've had them ten or fifteen year or more and , cos I 'm on these here tablets now for the old stomach like , and that like .
878792:10	well he must 've wanted to
878816:40	He says , he says I went , he says I had to go out there stuck in me bloody army stuff .
878842:10	I 'll have to go to the loo .
878882:33	Get , get well away and he , and he had to go back
878887:7	He must know the area .
878949:104	That 's it and let them , let them get on with it in the middle of bloody summer with a pint of water and say , look , that pint of water has to last you the day .
879057:14	Well she had exa had to examine everybody .
879126:42	Pound of , pound of meat in them , Tom , there must be , there must be .
879126:53	Pound of , pound of meat in them , Tom , there must be , there must be .
879249:67	Year and year since I used to get up make fire for Alice in the mornings , this is , must be ten or twelve year since , and light a cig up .
879250:10	Well I must 've passed out one morning .
879278:4	must be terrible that .
879377:57	Looking at all package deals today Tenerife , erm eighteen nights , hundred and five or summat but you had to go sixth February .
879403:7	He had to turn back cos of fog .
879477:17	and like me Auntie Jean has to go down three and four times a day sometimes .
879497:62	I never realised Chris owed me a fiver for me wage and I says to him I had to pay me bill for me food for week and it was like six quid .
879559:47	But in saying that , I , I would n't of minded if I had to go to college full-time cos I enjoyed it .
879614:45	And then they allow her got a stone and a half over before she has to start paying again .
879723:16	So you 're gonna have to , one day , Paul , you 'll look over the breakfast table and see wrinkles on me face and you 'll think , Oh , did I marry that ?
879783:18	She was going it must be that bad if you want you want to run off again .
879786:12	Thought you had to bring shoes into conversation
879808:51	so like after a few days I can her saying , oh , I 'm gonna have to go , I 'm gonna have to feed dog and they 're having it put down , they 're having it put down .
879808:75	so like after a few days I can her saying , oh , I 'm gonna have to go , I 'm gonna have to feed dog and they 're having it put down , they 're having it put down .
879989:21	She did n't like the have to put down er what relation they are to us you know
880174:12	then it 'll have to be dripped-dried
880249:28	I 've finished my coffee again , it must be that cup in it , w is yours still hot ?
880253:7	They must 've forgot
880361:6	Tuesday must of been Tuesday if it was the other day
880372:15	oh well , they must 've worked it out and find out she 's gotta be better off keeping her job
880444:58	They all s they stand there at the door going lighter as if it matters they have to get off the train with a cigarette in their mouth or they 're uncool , some shit like this
880600:7	they must have seen it land or something like that .
880683:10	You 'll have to go s Yeah , I know Pa dad , call me
880691:32	No , cos you have examinations to you have to be
880692:15	Yeah , but you had to pass an examination , did n't you ?
880777:7	We have to be early tomorrow because of going up to London you see .
880890:47	Is it really ? on the top there D d cos I suppose Amber has to go to school on Saturdays , does n't she ?
881013:13	What do you have to record ?
881067:37	I know cos that 's wh you sh you have to listen to words carefully
881152:13	Mom , you have to speak English .
881155:10	Well you have to speak English
881161:12	No , I have to leave it on all the time
881203:7	I have to phone Nick
881239:7	I have to get a lot of people
881422:7	I have to leave it on all the time though .
881490:86	On the other page yeah it had a picture of like this chart yeah and it had the picture of a grapefruit in all this sharing , you had to just draw that .
881644:12	Then you 'll have to buy some more .
881685:15	Yeah , but you have to clean it ?
881764:27	buy , a drink of water you have to pay eight pound .
881781:7	Nick has to come first .
881783:9	So I have to wait for him , come on .
881830:12	erm , you have to pay .
882002:21	Why 's your brother 's birthday have to be today ?
882015:23	Well what 's your brother 's birthday have to be tomorrow for ?
882077:43	I got much more homework than you Nick , because like , I have to do the tape thing as well .
882175:7	You must have been drunk .
882264:168	Anyway , yeah , and so , right I go to Bunnie and I , can you take me home yes , cos I 'm supposed to be going to a pizza to have pizza round my friend 's house , he goes , mm , they 're going , oh we 're starving , you have to go round to somebody 's house , I said he goes well I 'll take you stra , I 'll take you as soon as we 've had something to eat .
882268:30	And took me over there and my , I had to have argument with my mum .
882322:9	Cos I have to do
882659:11	Because I had to pay a then he paid off .
882783:12	Everyone will have to buy one of these machines and erm at the moment we might have to pay perhaps about a hundred pounds , but perhaps later these will become very , very cheap indeed and just will become part of the television set .
882783:55	Everyone will have to buy one of these machines and erm at the moment we might have to pay perhaps about a hundred pounds , but perhaps later these will become very , very cheap indeed and just will become part of the television set .
882791:18	I think we 'll have to think very carefully that our systems are compatible so that one home can send mail to another and that I would like .
882816:26	Now this is bad management and it must n't happen .
882886:23	Is n't the problem that you have to replace the whole unit if something goes wrong ?
882900:49	Well this is the situation where you would ideally you do n't want to have to look down at a speedometer .
882973:7	We have to come to terms with the fact that people 's experience of God differs enormously and the way they talk about God differs enormously , and in order for us to understand even what we mean we 've got to listen to them .
882974:175	There 's a great deal of theological thinking of a very different kind going on outside Europe in the Third World , in Latin America and Africa , in India - the place where we used to think we sent our understanding of God for the heathen to be converted to it , and we 're beginning to have to listen to those places and to receive what they have to give us , rather than thinking that it 's all settled in our patch of the world .
882974:210	There 's a great deal of theological thinking of a very different kind going on outside Europe in the Third World , in Latin America and Africa , in India - the place where we used to think we sent our understanding of God for the heathen to be converted to it , and we 're beginning to have to listen to those places and to receive what they have to give us , rather than thinking that it 's all settled in our patch of the world .
882995:214	I 'm afraid it still does happen that there is fanaticism , which is fanaticism is , as I understand it , self-righteousness with a strong religious dimension , and it does happen and I 've spoken of forces that erode it , but they can also exacerbate it , irritate it , into stronger activity , and of course we erm in the United Kingdom do n't have to look very far to see that happening , and it is , I think , a very great threat .
883057:7	This must be a problem , surely ?
883062:88	But in essence what the government say is that erm the parents ' rights as far as the , what is now called the statement - each authority must have a statement about children with special needs .
883068:67	And I would say that in this respect , too , there is another point in the Act that each child now must be related in some way to what is called a responsible person .
883085:150	Now the opposing argument to that is that if you create a special environment during the educational phase of a child 's life , then what happens after that for his I mean how far have you then separated them off from the sort of life that they will have to lead thereafter .
883094:249	The thing that worries some people is that as it 's come at this particular time that some of the things that might have been done five years ago by Local Education Authorities to improve their whole education for children with special needs may now , either through other competing financial pressures , or through inertia or whatever , the whole spirit of Warnock could be lost , and I think it 's a thing that , you know , one will have to keep a careful eye on .
883099:24	and I 'm sure that there must be listeners who are very interested in this , perhaps as parents , or perhaps being involved in education , is there any book or booklet they can get hold of to learn a bit more about the subject ?
883120:84	For example , many parts of the country , the South West , to some extent this area , are now finding that the benefits that they had to the rates system of people moving in after retirement after ten , fifteen , twenty years before disadvantages erm people need special hospital treatment , people need special types of accommodation and erm these are not the things that will be provided , as one of my speakers talking about hospital services said , by the private sector .
883151:27	And in a way , what they then have to be prepared for is people who are living into adult life because health for children is better - and this is true of many parts of the world , not only Latin America , but also Africa - and you 're going to have to find more jobs .
883151:164	And in a way , what they then have to be prepared for is people who are living into adult life because health for children is better - and this is true of many parts of the world , not only Latin America , but also Africa - and you 're going to have to find more jobs .
883204:204	They 're retiring to various parts of the country , down here onto the Sussex coast and on the whole coast into the South West - to the pleasant places if they can afford to do it , and they 're leaving the inner city and leaving behind there a lot of young families , often single parent families and older people , and of course the kind of provision you have to make , the Social Services , the needs of these communities differ quite widely .
883238:60	So you 've got these problems of balance , and it may be that in these situations Local Authorities have got to take a higher role in providing for their own people , as it were .
883259:91	So if we can look at the relatively small numbers , albeit , I mean , tragic numbers of people who have been harmed or died , we do have to set it into perspective against risks in other walks of life and against the enormous benefits that medicines have done .
883270:28	Nowadays if you 're testing a medicine you have to tell the patient .
883271:10	The doctor has to be perfectly frank with the patient and say this is a new medicine - I 'm trying it - erm I think it will do you good , but we ca n't be sure until we 've tested it .
883308:17	Surely this in itself must be dangerous ?
883344:94	mhm And I suppose in the old days if you actually wanted to know which books were popular and which books were not used at all , you had to a library and to painstakingly look through the shelves , perhaps , and look at the date stamps or something like that , whereas now presumably it 's just a question of pressing a few buttons and the information comes .
883351:8	We had to pay for it , so we had to send off a bill and therefore it knows what the price is .
883351:32	We had to pay for it , so we had to send off a bill and therefore it knows what the price is .
883365:193	Oh , yes , indeed , a close friend of mine has been working on the history of a very large British company and he 's just seen the proofs produced from the printers from the typescript which was typed in his own office , and apart from the fact that their computers can change the typefaces and improve the whole thing , the work has not had to be re-keyboarded , as they would say , re-typed in at all .
883413:109	Yes , he 's always jumping on me to tell me to do more for local radio and get South East Arts and South East Arts clients more regularly in contact with local radio , and I must admit on the latter case I do think that many of our clients do spend a great deal of time and erm want to be active with local radio .
883433:96	It 's marvellous that the Brighton Corporation came in , but nevertheless the building to perform a function which is going to be useful for the community as a whole has got to be properly funded .
883435:15	erm I would have to say in the university 's defence , as you would imagine I would say
883457:184	They do n't all have the same erm facilities as Sussex , nor indeed the same tradition of town and gown relationships , but nevertheless within the university there are several groups of people wanting to develop ideas of literature festivals or performance arts events , which we try and encourage because erm we have very little money within the Arts Association and have to maximise whatever facilities and people that we can lay our hands on .
883464:115	If we 're going to go in and make a positive impact in certain parts of the region , erm then both my staff and myself and our colleagues who are working in the arts in the region have got to pull even harder together to make sure that we can make the partnership between us bureaucrats and the artist really be as effective as possible for the broadest range of the community .
883471:18	However , what he had to say is still thoroughly relevant today .
883487:62	I mean you 're talking about having computers in the offices and perhaps in the home , now this must have great impact on the future education needs of people who are going to use these devices , surely ?
883518:208	At the moment erm the way that we use computers is , of course , to use a keyboard , but I was talking to some people today who 've now developed and you can buy it , erm a system on which you can write on what you want to say , so that as long as you print fairly clearly you do n't have to learn any new typing skills .
883595:36	I think parental anxieties are something with which one must have great sympathy because very often the anxiety is not so much an anxiety about the child , it 's an anxiety about the parent .
883602:172	If the parent feels they know a system that they have heard or read is successful , and if they try it out on the child and the child obviously enjoys it , if it becomes part of a game , then I ca n't see any harm in it , but I think the parent has to be scrupulously honest as to whether the child is enjoying it .
883613:134	Now if a parent can have introduced the child via nursery school to that amount of other children , then I think there should be very little trauma , but that is n't to say that as the child gets older they do n't have to do things .
883614:15	But if a child has to do something because they can understand the end a which they 're aiming , in the way that a footballer has to train , or a boxer has to train , then it becomes easier to do the equivalent of training .
883614:109	But if a child has to do something because they can understand the end a which they 're aiming , in the way that a footballer has to train , or a boxer has to train , then it becomes easier to do the equivalent of training .
883615:90	One of the difficulties is that the end state is so far removed from the average child that it is very difficult for them to see why they have to learn to read , but if they can realize that if they learn to read in those houses where they have it they 'll be able to read the Radio Times and know what the television programmes are , that at least is motivating .
883616:108	I mean reading as to be put in a context and a context that is , in fact , enjoyable to the child , not something that just happens at school that they have to do , hence one they go to school the value of parents hearing the children read , because then the parent is also involved and one does n't get this split between home and school .
883642:67	In the chemistry I did you seem to me to be terribly empirical , you had an inorganic substance and you had to learn absolute by heart what it did if you put it in water and you heated it and you did this that and the other .
883682:63	Once you 've got a system based on a particular form of fuel , such as petrol or gas , there has to be strong incentive to change it if it works well .
883727:7	There has to always be a control and that control will necessarily involve experiments on animals and the animal pressure groups are doing more harm than they can ever conceivably imagine by trying to control experiments on animals , because if they do n't experiment on animals a human somewhere is going to die .
883730:25	There always , with a new product , has to be the first experiment on a human , otherwise a new drug would n't come on the market .
883751:30	It , in the nineteen eighties and nineteen nineties , must be one of the best subjects they could ever conceive of going into because the whole of the future of modern civilization depends on chemistry .
883783:73	That fact , and the fact of being in the island , separated from the land wars which every other country in Europe has had to cope with , have produced in the British by now a different state of mind about politics , about the state , about the military , and about foreigners .
883840:90	Well people are not bound to lose , because some people do finish up ahead , but most people should expect to lose for the simple reason that bookies have got to make a living somehow , and therefore the odds that they offer to entice people to go in are such as to expect the bookie to make a profit , but that does n't mean to say that I am against the idea of people going in for gambling .
883925:35	You might then wonder what the cutting of the hair had to do with it - well , one of the features of auto-immune diseases is that they cluster within individuals and sometimes within an individual 's family , and the reasons for that are that the immune responses that we have we inherit with our genes .
883976:40	But occasional misfortunes do occur and that 's unavoidable , although one must keep in mind that patients with severe forms of this disease who are untreated used to died , now they do not .
883993:30	Does it just come over you - I must write a poem about this ?
884019:116	I mean when I wrote this book of bible poems in fact it took me a very long time and I started all sorts of subjects which I did n't finish , so , no , you have to be obedient to whether the poem intends to get written or not .
884020:46	Are there any rules for writing poetry in the sense that does it have to rhyme , does it have to have a rhythm , does it have to have a particular for to be recognised and accepted as a piece of poetry as opposed , perhaps , to a piece of prose ?
884020:65	Are there any rules for writing poetry in the sense that does it have to rhyme , does it have to have a rhythm , does it have to have a particular for to be recognised and accepted as a piece of poetry as opposed , perhaps , to a piece of prose ?
884020:90	Are there any rules for writing poetry in the sense that does it have to rhyme , does it have to have a rhythm , does it have to have a particular for to be recognised and accepted as a piece of poetry as opposed , perhaps , to a piece of prose ?
884068:19	Well you do n't necessarily have to bring the collective unconscious , do you ?
884070:205	We 've all - take these two poems , we 've all been children ; most people have been in love ; we 're all we all think about our death ; we all think about our parents ; we all like stories and we all like stories that seem , you know , to deal with some primal central human experience , so I do n't think you have to say anything more than what we all know already , that we all have a great deal in common with one another .
884116:116	But in a way the nineteenth century was the century of history , because it was erm thought at that particular period of time that in order to understand what was going on in contemporary life , you had to have historical appreciation , knowledge and perspective , and a great deal of the explanation of other subjects in the nineteenth century was , if you like , historical in character .
884128:36	In other words , somebody else in twenty five years time will have to do a different kind of social history .
884143:79	And he will require in order to do that to be a time traveller into the past , as much as a science fiction writer would have to be a time traveller into the future .
884168:28	And if you 're a professor , well you have to like studying and you have to like reading and you have to like teaching and all these other things .
884168:50	And if you 're a professor , well you have to like studying and you have to like reading and you have to like teaching and all these other things .
884168:69	And if you 're a professor , well you have to like studying and you have to like reading and you have to like teaching and all these other things .
884236:17	It is that you have to learn how to get rich and how to get peaceful and how to be , you know , how to have a good life
884238:24	How to be happy - you have to learn how to do it .
884246:62	I remember the corcus race in Alice in Wonderland , where Alice says everybody is one so everybody must have prizes .
884284:64	One of the difficulties , it seems to me , that exists in schools today is that the teacher has to cope with a fairly large class , and one possible advantage of having a fair number of microcomputers
884318:44	But there 's a sense in which the teachers themselves are going to have to learn new skills , both in terms of the sheer mechanics of handling these devices , but also in sort of learning how to use them best in their actual teaching .
884361:7	You have to look at the way in which children learn , and the principle vehicle through which children learn is associated with visual symbols , and later with the written word .
884376:24	Then , says Bob Brooks , teachers must observe the quality of the child 's classroom response .
884377:26	The teacher in the first school classroom particularly has got to look out , they 've got to be aware , does the child give any overt sign of recognition ?
884388:146	I think you might find a situation quite clearly where you would find a child behaving in such a way in the classroom that it was being disruptive to himself , disruptive to teachers , disruptive to , to his classmates , and therefore the , the first move must be in a direction of rearranging that behaviour so that there could develop a situation in which you might do something about the learning difficulty .
884389:81	On the other side of the coin you might find a child who is experiencing such difficulties in his learning that the first line of attack must be in , in terms of perhaps producing just an improvement of his base level of learning , so that the next step can be taken .
884406:42	If nothing happens by such and such a time , then we shall have to do something else .
884408:20	With any disturbed child , we have to be patient and we have to learn to wait .
884408:39	With any disturbed child , we have to be patient and we have to learn to wait .
884458:18	The language that the layman has to learn is not the original machine code or even the more modern FORTRAN or PASCAL , which is used by scientists , but is generally BASIC , which , as its name denotes , is a very straightforward set of instructions in simple English .
884464:29	The electrical power consumed and the heat that had to be dissipated by elaborate cooling systems made them expensive and inconvenient to run .
884469:43	Basically they can add or subtract , and anything more complicated than this has to be achieved by breaking down the more elaborate procedures down to a sometimes large number of successive steps .
884473:19	The early computer programmer and user had to learn to speak the language of the computer , machine code , and had to learn how to put these simple instructions , often in very tedious forms , into the computer .
884473:63	The early computer programmer and user had to learn to speak the language of the computer , machine code , and had to learn how to put these simple instructions , often in very tedious forms , into the computer .
884474:9	The language had to be learnt and used with great accuracy , because there was very little tolerance for error .
884512:15	Of course this calculation has to be taken with a pinch of salt .
884549:35	Very much a practical proposition , but I think you do have to be fairly keen and interested .
884565:12	You still have to put the data in once , you have to enter the invoice , but once it 's entered , it will be there to be accessed in all sorts of different ways , and at the end of the month , a business would very often want to send out statements .
884565:39	You still have to put the data in once , you have to enter the invoice , but once it 's entered , it will be there to be accessed in all sorts of different ways , and at the end of the month , a business would very often want to send out statements .
884570:100	Well , this is a slightly more complicated application , where you 're not just selling for example straight from stock , but you take orders from customers , and then you would have to manufacture , perhaps to buy in , to assemble , some sort of goods for sending out .
884571:34	And so the systems become a little more complicated in that you have to keep records of your customers , of your orders , of your stock , and to some extent , of how your own production , or your assembly , is getting along .
884584:10	Well you have to have some idea of what you want to do with it .
884587:23	So that first of all we would have to look at how much time people spend preparing invoices , sending out statements , producing age debtors lists and that sort of thing .
884589:137	But if you do find an area where you could save a key person several hours a day , then that is real money saved where he could be using his special expertise in his business to get more business , and then one would have to look more closely at erm the particular application , particular jobs that he 's doing and that could be put on the computer .
884593:44	It is the programs that have been written , and these packaged programs have got to be fairly close to your business in order not to be very frustrating and more bother than they are worth .
884608:9	And you have to have a maintenance contract .
884622:19	erm I think that must often be the case .
884658:15	I think we have to be a little bit careful about this because , of course , erm the feeling is not that once they 've been in the job for a little while that they are still amateurs , it 's merely that we do n't require them to know a great deal about what they 're going to do before they start .
884674:98	erm On social security and health together it 's about ten percentage points higher in West Germany erm and about six percentage points higher in France than in the U K And I must say I do wonder why in West Germany erm you 've got half as many again doctors per hundred thousand of the population of the U K and only about two-thirds as many nurses , which does suggest , you know , differences in national approaches to things like health care .
884683:68	Although in terms of expense they are of course more expensive , and therefore this also erm is something one , one has to consider .
884686:27	National food , drink , sport and erm other habits must also be relevant to the understanding of this problem .
884703:104	On the other hand I suspect that you as a magistrate have , have views about the amount of time that it takes up erm in your court , dealing with what must seem to you erm fairly erm minor offenses , and I wonder what you feel about it .
884713:55	That 's a great satisfaction to everybody , it goes to a car pound , and then you have to go there and pay your sixty dollars or whatever it is to get it out .
884727:118	First of all , he 's got a general election coming up and we do n't know what its result 's going to be and it may disappoint him , he may find that the Parliament he has to work with is not going to be of the same cast of mind as himself .
884739:113	Monsieur Mitterand has already said that he 's going to seek to drive a harder bargain with Britain over fishing limits even than President Giscard was trying to do , and I think our negotiators must expect a rather tough time as far as fisheries are concerned .
884742:141	This is partly because fishing rights erm were written in erm to the , to the European Community system erm as part of in a sense the agricultural policy , erm because they were regarded as part of food policy , and it was thought that you must have , if you 're going to have a common agricultural policy , and that was one of the important points erm of the negotiations for setting up the European Community , then a common fisheries policy went alongside with that .
884779:104	Now , to what extent could one move in that direction using a computer , which is a rather precise and definite sort of object that wants to know exactly what it has to do and how it has to do it ?
884779:124	Now , to what extent could one move in that direction using a computer , which is a rather precise and definite sort of object that wants to know exactly what it has to do and how it has to do it ?
884783:50	Now , if we can do it , and it 's not magic , then there must be some reasons we can do it , some rules we 're following , and those rules can in principle be put into computers .
884800:34	But it is very unfriendly in a way which erm has to do with the type of interaction you 've got to have .
884809:38	Of course at the moment they 're very unfriendly in that you have to learn to type .
884818:154	Packages which checked your spelling , for example , in something you 've put on and very politely suggested that you may or may not have got a word quite correctly spelt that you had intended perhaps spelt one way , it came out as another way , and there must be an awful lot of work going on in this area .
884822:7	They have to have a lot of rules built in .
884832:158	If the new , friendlier systems do come onto the market , and if they 're bought as presents and so on , and they get into the homes and they get into the schools , then people will just learn to use them , and it 's the existing professionals who may have to change their habits to accommodate .
884890:140	Some of the newly qualified teachers , perhaps , found some difficulties initially in coping with the wide range of abilities the mixed ability classes presented them with , and in some ways the school was not well provided with in-service support for mixed ability teaching and had to do a lot of their own work in terms of the appropriate methods to choose , the appropriate resources , the appropriate materials to develop .
884909:24	Well I think really what one must look for now is more detailed research on what actually goes on in mixed ability classrooms .
884914:21	The difficulties are that one has to spend a lot of time sitting in the classroom working with the teacher , or observing the teacher , and it 's difficult to find that time when one is teaching at university .
884961:20	To start the exchange we have to suggest a list of possible topics , but we also feel confident that we could should be able to lecture on any topic , any scientific topic , to , for instance , third form children certainly .
885008:29	And he concluded , quite soberly , that they must have been visited by muse .
885050:124	He thinks it is itself something beautiful that sort of swims down into our world and is incarnated in particular objects , and then he wonders about that because his own way of forming universals means that he 'd have to do it all again and again and again in an infinite regress , so he has a problem , basically , about calling beauty itself beautiful .
885071:17	One thing that I had to say , frankly , at the beginning of my book on allegory was that The Tempest was not the necessary base of that book .
885122:17	Those of course would have to qualify according to the rules of technical assistance and British aid , but in principle the study seminars are certainly open and we normally have people from countries other than the Third World ones .
885144:40	Well that is a very difficult one for anybody who erm has to try and sort out the ideological , tribal , personal rivalries in Uganda and to answer the question of whether these are going to get in the way of some sort of erm coherent government policy and political stability .
885177:43	But is n't there a sense in which people in other countries really have to help themselves , at least in the first instance ?
885181:7	People have got to be involved in solving themselves the problems themselves .
885196:57	I was co-ordinating operational activities in the Institute , an international project on commodities last year , and I had to visit a number of research institutes in Asia , erm in Africa and in the Americas , where they were conducting studies on the commodities they produced .
885244:82	I was trying to suggest that instead of actually definitely writing novels with a very straightforward moral theme , the theme of the novel being that you must do this or terrible things will happen , instead of doing that erm she is anxious to write novels which show you moral possibilities , that somebody or other may actually get into difficulty because they fail to understand something about somebody else and I think that these novels are intended to tell people more about themselves that erm they might otherwise realize .
885335:145	I do n't like just doing research without communicating it , and I think if you 've got an interest and you can communicate it well to people , then it stimulates their enjoyment and of course in a time when there 's going to have to be more and more leisure I think that 's very important .
885346:14	And you do n't have to have a history degree to come along to one of these things ?
885353:8	They have to buy their own lunch in the university refectory , but that 's an experience in itself , so anybody who wants to come and play student for the day , it 's great fun .
885378:80	I liked York very much , because it was set round a lake and it was the first one I went to , but I must say of the other modern universities that I know I would say that Sussex was erm was the other best one that I 've been to and the one that I felt most comfortable and happy .
885390:15	I imagine it must do , yes .
885419:7	There must be quite a number of members from the university who are in the chorus .
885427:14	Here again , there must be a fair number of university people that are involved in one way and another ?
885502:12	They do n't have to make those initial decisions of how to plan their time and their work .
885671:30	I think this is something which everybody has to work out for themselves .
885687:66	It 's not because it 's the tool of , well , physics anyway and engineering , it 's because you have to think in a way that is probably entirely foreign to you .
885757:87	I realize I 'm sort of giving a very , very negative impression , and I do n't want to give the suggestion either that being unemployed has to be always bad , that all unemployed people are having a totally horrible time all of the time and are feeling very depressed all of the time - that 's not the case - but I 'm afraid that is more like the average erm situation , the typical situation , than otherwise .
885800:20	I think that the schools have to fight this image , but I would say that the girls themselves more recently are also changing their ideas of themselves and we are making progress .
885839:28	Juliette , it seems to me that openness must be represented not just in the way a school carries out its activities , but also the way it 's run , the way it 's governed .
885870:103	As you probably know , about ninety eight per cent of all criminal cases are dealt with by magistrates ' court , which is a truly remarkable figure , and I think you have to think about it twice when it 's first said .
885880:148	In the Magistrates ' Court the decision as to verdict and sentence is entirely for the Justices acting on the advice of their Clerk , and of course it is erm true to say that generally speaking Justices will follow the advice of their Clerk , but they do n't have to .
885896:21	I 'm afraid you 'd have to look up that figure .
885905:12	They do n't have to have a solicitor to represent them ?
885922:162	And of course what very often happens these days , with such a high level of unemployment , is if it 's a fine that 's decided upon - and I think something like in three-quarters of the cases dealt with by Magistrates do end up with a fine - that it has to be scaled down because of the erm poor circumstance , poor financial circumstance in which the defendant is .
885974:200	Though that 's beginning to be qualified a little because of the erm effects of erm national legislation , for example national employment legislation nowadays requires that all employers in a certain field of employment , and universities is one , erm pursue similar policies towards their staff , and indeed in our case erm pay them on the same pay scales and erm so in that sense we have to enter into agreements with trade unions and others which are binding on our members .
885980:36	Well , relative to the size of the job we have to do I think the answer is yes .
885981:37	If you 're comparing us with primary and secondary schools we have to remember that the erm the great erm age bulge pass has passed through the primary schools and is passing through the secondary schools and is still to reach higher education .
885985:21	So that means that the productivity has to go up , presumably .
886018:14	But supposing we had to make cuts all the same , supposing we just were forced into it , would you suggest that the best idea would be to close down one or two universities , not Sussex of course but one or two of the other universities ?
886019:63	I do n't really think that , that this is likely to , to be an option which governments have to consider .
886035:34	The availability of calculating machines , and now micro-computers , must have affected the way that maths is taught , and also possibly the skills that are needed to become a good mathematician .
886044:34	Well , yes , of course , but erm we have to remember that a large number of children have always left school without knowing their tables , without really having got anything out of mathematics .
886059:11	And the child has to combine those three numbers to fill one of the squares on the screen .
886068:16	I mean to have to work out from first principles erm four plus three is seven every time , you may be able to do that with great understanding , but there 's an awful waste of time if you 've got to understand it each time .
886070:23	Yes , of course , and there has to be a balance , and we must n't go too far to one extreme .
886070:46	Yes , of course , and there has to be a balance , and we must n't go too far to one extreme .
886077:22	Old-fashioned mathematics you used to have to do calculations of how many square feet of linoleum you
886093:20	I 'm sure though they have to go into primary .
886161:90	And he went to them , and he found that they had n't a clue what they 'd written , and he concluded , quite soberly , that they must have been visited by a Muse .
886224:55	And then he wonders about that because his own way of forming universals means that he 'd have to do it all again and again and again , in an infinite regress .
886252:17	One thing that I had to say , frankly , at the beginning of my book on allegory , was that The Tempest was not the necessary base of that book .
886279:91	One of the difficulties , I would imagine , is associated not just with the level of cutbacks , but also the scale of time in which they 're have to be implemented .
886281:119	It 's more at the medium-term level that you can talk about the system making sensible adjustments to new circumstances , and indeed , many schools and many Local Education Authorities have simply had to do that , they 've had to erm adjust to much smaller numbers of pupils , correspondingly smaller numbers of teachers , and a much more static situation generally .
886284:49	One of them is at the post-compulsory level of schooling , where people no longer have to be at school .
886308:143	erm There are one or two people who have just begun to identify a faint movement back into an increase in numbers , but over very many years you can know pretty well exactly where you are as far as the total number of pupils you have to provide for is concerned , and therefore , in that sense , the system can plan its resources for a known population .
886355:25	And that 's something which you have to get across to young people , and if they 're involved in the actual discussions on this , they 're involved in the organisation , they begin to see the complexities , and they 're less inclined to think , to automatically assume that erm people are n't on their side and do n't want to listen .
886379:110	And I think if you 've got an interest and you can communicate it well to people , then it stimulates their enjoyment , and of course in a time when there 's going to have to be more and more leisure , I think that 's very important .
886388:14	And you do n't have to have a history degree to come along to one of these things ?
886395:8	They have to buy their own lunch in the University Refectory , but that 's an experience in itself , so anybody who wants to come and play student for the day , it 's , it 's great fun .
886416:82	I liked York very much , because it was set round a lake and erm it was the first one I went to , but I must say that of the other modern universities that I know I would say that Sussex was erm was the other best one that I 've been to and the one that I 've felt most erm comfortable and happy in .
886490:20	But this is what he had to say about one of the side effects that he noted .
886504:61	This attitude , you know , boys will be boys and they make a mess and poor Mum has to do all the washing , is really quite , quite misguided because it , it does encourage those assumptions that mothers are there to tidy up after sons , and of course then sons when they grow up and get wives want to replace their mothers .
886547:31	And once you spent those dockets , you just had to go and buy secondhand if you wanted any more .
886583:121	Well it 's hard to know where to stop , really erm I mean the , the difficulty of concentrating on one area of the country , is that we 're of course I think there must be very great differences in different areas of the country .
886592:10	Now one has to get this picture into some sort of perspective against , as I said , the big films of today .
886822:7	You have to erm spend progressively more because it , it , it , it just is as you say much much harder to get down .
886823:7	You have to have bigger compressors , higher pressures , and , and better insulation .
886926:12	erm Do you have to wear gloves and protective equipment to do these experiments ?
886929:114	It 's really erm insulated by about ten different layers from erm of various kinds of insulation from , from , from the room , so that erm we never actually experience the low temperatures ourselves , I must confess .
886946:24	And in the past few years we 've had to go into clearing as most other universities would do .
886954:20	Well I think that it must be recognised that the current state of demand and supply is going to make it very difficult for most applicants , and we would be concerned to advise them not to panic unduly as a result of that , and to make their choices on the sort of rational criteria that would apply in any year .
886982:7	It has to be a serious process of thought and research , both about the candidate 's own interests and motivation , and about the type of course and institution which they want to attend .
887005:19	I think candidates somehow have got to assume that the admissions tutors or selectors do n't think the candidate wants to do the course .
887021:12	UCCA then have to process it , they create a computer record , they photocopy it , and pass those papers then on to the universities .
887080:23	erm I think first you have to relate to so many teachers erm as a parent of a secondary school child , and this is obviously a much more complicated procedure and also I think parents , many parents feel that they know a little bit less about what their children are doing at school at the secondary stage , it 's all that little bit more advanced , that little bit more different perhaps from what they had in their own education .
887221:9	Well that must have been quite a mess .
887244:30	It , it 's a thing that we have to live with , it seems .
887262:18	How much do you have to look after a pond , I mean
887266:12	do you actually have to do
887320:21	And I think if I had to choose an adjective to describe myself , I would say that I 'm a cultural historian , with a very strong social interest .
887353:117	But in a way the nineteenth century was the century of history , because it was erm thought at that particular period of time that in order to understand what was going on in contemporary life , you had to have some historical appreciation , knowledge and perspective , and erm a great deal of the explanation of other subjects in the nineteenth century was , erm if you like , historical in character .
887375:67	And we 're always revising that picture of the past , in other words , somebody else in twenty-five years ' time will have to do a different kind of social history .
887391:81	And he will require , in order to do that , to be a time traveller into the past as much as a science fiction writer would have to be a time traveller into the future .
887467:24	And one of the things we must n't do , in fact , is to assume that erm our seventeenth ancestor is just ourselves in funny clothes .
887468:12	What we have to do , we have to make the mental leap into a very different world in which witchcraft and dreams and superstitions and so on are mingling together and we must make that effort , and not just assume that somehow it 's William Gladstone who happens to be dressed up in Oliver Cromwell 's clothes .
887468:27	What we have to do , we have to make the mental leap into a very different world in which witchcraft and dreams and superstitions and so on are mingling together and we must make that effort , and not just assume that somehow it 's William Gladstone who happens to be dressed up in Oliver Cromwell 's clothes .
887468:108	What we have to do , we have to make the mental leap into a very different world in which witchcraft and dreams and superstitions and so on are mingling together and we must make that effort , and not just assume that somehow it 's William Gladstone who happens to be dressed up in Oliver Cromwell 's clothes .
887505:123	She had a number of very enthusiastic friends who did the research and , and generally assisted her , but everybody gives her credit for , not only working in New York , but it actually was not Federal legislation , they had to work state by state .
887508:7	It must be .
887591:23	I think the first answer I must give you is , is simply in terms of my personal biography .
887622:7	You had to be very courageous to be a democrat .
887628:219	They 've not in the past shown themselves to be very honest erm nor very keen on going into their own archives , and I think it 's , actually takes people like me , who live on the border-lines if you like of the two cultures , to go in and discover erm sometimes embarrassing documents , embarrassing information , to confront them with it , in their own language , so that they have to take stock .
887630:62	One of the things that always puzzles me about archives is it seems to me that there must be a limited number of archives , and there are an awful number of historians .
887638:9	So one has to actually learn erm an entirely new alphabet before even being able to read the first word on the first page that you see in the archives .
887641:15	I think you have to evolve , develop quite a lot of detective sense , to meet people , to imagine where could further letters be that would help me , and you have to charm your way virtually into those houses , and persuade the people erm to let you look at Grandfather 's letters in the trunk in the attic .
887641:108	I think you have to evolve , develop quite a lot of detective sense , to meet people , to imagine where could further letters be that would help me , and you have to charm your way virtually into those houses , and persuade the people erm to let you look at Grandfather 's letters in the trunk in the attic .
887648:93	I discovered recently , in a public archive , a letter from the Kaiser , written in nineteen nineteen , to erm an ex-general of his , saying that the Jews must be exterminated from German soil .
887719:151	And it 's this journey from external reality to the profound truths of art , a journey which takes Proust through a series of investigations of the nature of time , the nature of the intellect , the nature of memory , it 's this journey which I must now attempt to trace , and I perhaps just ought to say that I think I get abstract once or twice from this point onwards .
887720:94	I do n't think it 's so much the difficulty of the matter , as the inadequacy of the manner , but erm it the main structure behind erm what I have to say at any rate revolves round these three successive ideas of time , intellect , memory .
887731:77	Now turning from the structure very quickly to the style , one has I suppose to underline Proust 's insistence that a writer 's style must grow organically out of his thought , out of his conception of reality .
887785:12	Well , you have to be terribly diplomatic .
887812:18	mhm And , and you had to provide information about them , apart from everything else .
887869:33	Well , course , erm like most things you have to work at it .
887870:7	You must prepare yourself for it in the erm in the time-honoured way , which is to erm acquire A-levels or erm an Open University qualification or a Higher National Certificate or something of that kind .
887956:23	It seems to me that it must be a very fine line must be drawn a violent act and a non-violent act .
887956:39	It seems to me that it must be a very fine line must be drawn a violent act and a non-violent act .
887967:120	Certainly discretion is exercised by human beings , and those human beings are subject to all the , the frailties of humanity , and in many situations the policeman is in a tense but essentially human situation , where he has to make snap decisions on the spot .
888040:77	I , my interest lies particularly I think in the kind of erm popular fiction written in America between the wars , though it has to some extent carried on since World War Two .
888060:74	I have always liked to read the Golden Age detective stories , if you like , the country house murder mysteries , but I would have to admit that reading those is to some extent desire for stasis , a desire erm for a particularly safe kind of world , where everything works out in the end , because that 's usually what happens , and so these days I tend only to take very small doses of that particular medicine .
888074:234	erm If you take a novel like Dorothy Sayers ' Gaudy Night , which is offered as an example of a classic detective story which really is also a novel about academic life , it 's a love story , I think as a love story and as a novel of academic life it 's in many ways very good indeed , but I think as a detective story it 's completely uninteresting you know because one part has to fade in order that the , the other should come into focus .
888103:47	erm One of the reasons is that , unlike the British situation , you do n't have to resign if you stand for election as a Member of Parliament in France .
888145:207	He may not be able to see the political and general interest wood for the specialist trees , and there is a sense in which there are obviously dangers of that kind erm and the generalist has always taken the view that it 's for the specialist to be able to explain his problems in language which , after all , politicians who take the final decisions will have to be able to understand .
888147:42	I 'm not sure it 's a bad thing for a specialist to have to be able to explain his problems in terms which erm and intelligent and reasonably informed layman can understand , but erm I think perhaps in Britain we go too far erm in not integrating the two and putting them together and erm this is somewhere where the French in many cases have got the balance a bit better .
888159:45	erm Other people 's solutions affect what we can do , and so we have to come closer , in the sense at least of understanding and consulting .
888182:31	does n't work out the right way , but that must be just the tip of the iceberg as far as you 're concerned .
888185:13	What do you have to do actually to , to prepare a forecast ?
888197:32	Well of course to forecast the weather accurately , you have to understand the atmosphere .
888211:7	We have to assume it 's the same as the nearest observation , so erm it can be misleading just to take the surface observation , surface instrumentation readings , erm but erm we have to be able to interpolate , and this is the experience of the forecaster comes in , to say what is in the gaps .
888211:110	We have to assume it 's the same as the nearest observation , so erm it can be misleading just to take the surface observation , surface instrumentation readings , erm but erm we have to be able to interpolate , and this is the experience of the forecaster comes in , to say what is in the gaps .
888221:12	erm We have to study the atmosphere at very levels , say , from the ground , up to six inches above the ground .
888234:49	For daily operation and domestic use , of course , the Electricity and Gas Authorities , they have to predict the amount of gas or electricity required , and the first thing they have to think about is what is the weather expected ?
888234:96	For daily operation and domestic use , of course , the Electricity and Gas Authorities , they have to predict the amount of gas or electricity required , and the first thing they have to think about is what is the weather expected ?
888239:25	And I suppose people organising special events must erm seek your advice on occasions .
888243:118	I personally do n't like doing it , because it involves accountancy and all this sort of thing , but erm it erm when you stop and think about it , it 's a , it 's a must .
888256:16	Well of course it must do , it 's on the south coast for , first of all , but erm the South Downs have their problems .
888353:13	erm You must recognise that the general outline of school education , from primary and in secondary level , is a matter of policy , and this is in the hands of the D E S and local authorities .
888354:20	Our role , I think , has to be , among a great many other things , to look at the over-all effect of the school curriculum , to ensure that it 's balanced , that it 's cohesive , and that it has an appropriate spread for all children .
888366:40	It 's an age when I think erm children leaving school have got to be versatile , self-reliant and able to cope with very changing situation .
888368:11	And so children have got to leave school able to cope with these changes , and this means that we have to develop self-reliance in them , and general abilities for living .
888368:64	And so children have got to leave school able to cope with these changes , and this means that we have to develop self-reliance in them , and general abilities for living .
888371:133	Yes , that is something that erm we 've erm made quite clear , as a result of our first major meeting , which we held two or three weeks ago , that sex equality , sex stereotyping , are matters that have got to be looked into very carefully .
888372:100	This is particularly important , and I 'm now riding my own hobby horse , but in the area of science erm we have a situation that erm in most secondary schools choice has to be made at the age of thirteen , fourteen , by boys and girls as to which subjects they should take .
888375:37	And we are moving into an age , I think it must be recognised , where some of the traditional jobs for girls , for example , secretaries , shops , things of this sort , are actually being decreased because of the technological revolution , so bearing in mind that something like seventy per cent of women are actually in employment , it 's very important that a girl , at the age of thirteen or fourteen , does not decide to cut herself off from the possibility of employment in these technological , engineering fields .
888378:7	It must be very difficult to be objective so far as the curriculum and level of knowledge of certain subjects are concerned .
888383:121	One thing that has not been taken up very thoroughly at this stage is the question of teaching of mathematics in primary schools , and this is a field that erm we decided at our last meeting that we must erm look into .
888388:41	Well of course there , there is this worry , and , and they have to be used erm properly and in a helpful way .
888391:71	So I think there is a lot of work to be done there , but as you rightly say , it has to be done carefully and one must n't get the dependency on calculators which one does see around one .
888391:93	So I think there is a lot of work to be done there , but as you rightly say , it has to be done carefully and one must n't get the dependency on calculators which one does see around one .
888392:31	I 've seen this in shops when somebody has to add a twenty p to seventy-three p and out comes the calculator
888399:42	So it is a major problem , this communication , and so we do have to work with local authorities , with teacher organisations , anyone who can help us in this task .
888420:28	The folklore in school terms is that you have to be a relatively ancient teenager to appreciate physics and chemistry and biology .
888434:64	Do you think we perhaps put kids off an interest in science by our sort of insistence that they have to have a solid understanding of Newton 's laws and all sorts of principles , and we lose the magic too early ?
888473:160	Again , it 's a questin of matching the kit to the age of the child because some of them erm - the one we have at home , for example , plugs into the mains and although it only pushes out six or nine volts at the end the child actually does have to plug it in and , well I do n't think I 'd be happy if my six or seven year old was doing that , although my nine year old could cope with it quite happily .
888503:40	So that I feel that one of the things that we must do is ensure that all people who are now training to be teachers , and those who already in the service , have got to be given more information about the condition so that they may be able to recognise it .

888507:140	The P G C is a difficult course to fill , really , for the people who are organising it , because although it 's called a one-year course , in fact it lasts eight months in practice , and there are so many aspects that have to be fitted in something has to go .

888530:22	In order to spell , one has to combine both kinds of sequence , one has to think of the syllables in the word in the correct order and remember them and remember how far you got , and also remember the sequence of visual symbols , i.e. letters on paper .

888532:16	Last of all , we must mention orientation .
888675:18	Well you do n't actually have to do that with the pye meson because if it erm if you have a pye meson it just breaks up itself .
888678:41	You see the thing is produce something like a pyon you have to create enough energy to make it , and in order to create enough energy the you have to produce particles colliding at very high speeds , and in order to produce these particles you have to accelerate them .

888698:179	For example , they lived very much longer than one would have expected , and Gellmann said well these were strange particles and he invented a new quantum number called a strangeness , and then he assumed that this strangeness quantum number was not quite conserved. erm we have conserved quantum numbers in physics like the charge - you have to conserve the charge , but you do n't quite have to conserve the strangeness .

888728:18	We 're going to have to talk about what astronomical units are in a moment , but let 's go on in terms of size .
888766:62	And that 's , I think , important because it gives us some concept of how far we would have to go to get there , as it were , apart from seeing it .
888794:24	But , Robert , we on earth must have a very small baseline compared with the big distances we 're trying to measure ?
888800:45	And that get us up to a certain distance , but even then that method must fail when you get beyond a certain distance .
888804:46	Beyond that the angles involved become just too small to be measured and we have to use a quite different kind of technique which involves knowing something about the properties of the objects we 're looking at .
888828:163	For very distant objects these stars themselves are too faint to be visible , but if you look at clusters of galaxies , we find that the very brightest galaxy in a cluster is the same brightness in all clusters and so the fainter it looks to us the further away the cluster of galaxies must be .
888911:9	But I must say I 'm very encouraged to see the numbers of women who are applying to do subjects like chemistry and physics is going up and certainly we would applaud that sort of activity .
888983:64	Well not before the doctor sees the patient , because much of the information that is fed in would have to be gain , acquired , by somebody with a good deal of medical knowledge .
889011:12	So you do have to rely very heavily on collaboration with the local doctors ?
889013:127	This is one very good aspect of such projects , I think , that the interesting work is to be done at the interface between one discipline - medicine in this case and another discipline - computer science - where both people just have to learn to talk to each other in their own language .
889037:49	It 's possible , I suppose , but I think a lot of research has to be done on the way interaction takes place .
889074:90	mhm And I suppose in the old days if you actually wanted to know which books were popular and which books were not used at all you had to send a librarian to painstakingly look through the shelves , perhaps , and look at the date stamps or something like that , whereas now it 's presumably just a question of pressing a few buttons and the information comes .
889082:8	We had to pay for it , so we had to send off a bill and therefore it knows what the price is .
889082:32	We had to pay for it , so we had to send off a bill and therefore it knows what the price is .
889083:7	We have to put a shelf mark on the book so that we can shelve the book , but that tells us quite a lot about the subject .
889105:191	Oh yes , indeed , a close friend of mine has been working on a history of a very large British company and he 's just seen the proofs produced from the printers from the typescript which was typed in his own office , and apart from the fact that their computers can change the typefaces and improve the whole thing , the work has not had to be rekeyboarded , as they would say , retyped in , at all .

889202:153	I think sometimes people who do n't actually work in schools imagine that the schools are managed , in the financial organisational sense , by the Local Education Authority , and that in some way the head of the school is merely concerned with discipline , curriculum and so on , but one has to bear in mind that the sheer size of some of these schools now makes the head a manager in a very real sense .
889203:15	I mean I have to cope with about five thousand different individuals each week erm at Portslade Community College , erm fifteen hundred full-time eleven to eighteen year olds , and the rest adults from the community coming in to use the college .
889220:18	Well I think I must take issue with you when you talk about the old days .
889231:142	When you come to internal democracy and how much , say , the pupils have , I agree with Bob that is a very tricky one and certainly you ca n't just transplant erm democracy onto what is really a rather authoritarian system , you 'd have to prepare and train pupils much more than we do and what I think is the most dangerous thing is playing at democracy which I am sure we should not do in schools .
889232:64	I think that some people may not realise fully too is that in order to make a decision you have to be full informed , and teachers are very busy people and a teacher really is spending nearly every moment of his day either teaching or preparing to teach , and it 's impossible , therefore , to establish in a school or a community college the faculty committee structure that one might have in a university , where people do probably spend some time informing themselves before debate .
889246:151	Michael Marland has talked about the disappearance of deference and I think that 's the biggest change really that the kind of instant erm response to authority has gone and that has good and bad sides in it , so more is demanded of the teacher because his authority has to be earned , much more even than in the past I think .
889275:93	Obviously there is a very delicate balance between erm demanding too much of people 's time in consulting and talking with you , and not involving them at all , and you have to be very sensitive to how much time people are prepared to give and how much they want to be involved in something .
889279:7	People have to be involved in something if they 're going to want to do something at the end .
889281:87	One does n't want them to sort of follow it blindly , of course , one wants them to discuss it carefully , very carefully , but it has to sort of fit into the ongoing life of the institution and not be a kind of little game that someone is playing on their own somewhere because they happen to be linked with the university or doing a degree or something .
889302:17	Even in a school one has to think of a very large number of different pupils with their own different characteristics and strengths and weaknesses , and one has to operate in a classroom and to a timetable and with given resources , and so on and so forth , and the combination of all these pressures and the ways that one has got used to handling them , on the whole , is what makes a person teach the way they do .

889309:164	There are other things that emerge from evaluation that perhaps suggest that at least , not necessarily universally , but for that particular school , with those particular children , with those particular aims , if they want to achieve what they 're trying to achieve , then they 're going to have to make some rather more or at least some of the people are going to have to make some rather more fundamental changes in the way that they , say , handle children in the classroom , than might otherwise be the case .

889313:7	One has to develop routines to cope with the situation because it is far too complicated a situation to be handled in any other way .
889314:74	You just cannot pay attention continuously to all the different variables in a situation and remain sane at the end of the day , you have to develop routines and techniques for handling it .
889361:7	I must say that it sheds some light on the state of some of the aircraft that I had to fly in then .
889361:59	I must say that it sheds some light on the state of some of the aircraft that I had to fly in then .
889385:28	People clearly are interested in what Darwin had to say erm and they mind about whether he was right or not , and I think that many people , I dare say many people in this room , have a wish which they may be conscious of and they may not , sometimes quite a strong wish , that he 'll turn out to be wrong .
889386:17	And I think one has to ask themselves why should this be so ?
889401:174	which I shall not attempt to conceal from you , but before I come down to the details let me say that Darwinism occupies such a central position in evolutionary biology - in biology as a whole , not just in evolutionary biology but in the whole of biology - that any important , new idea in biology has to be , to some extent , judged by its compatibility with , or its contradictions of , the Darwinian position .
889437:205	The claim is that because of this feature of the fossil record the major features of evolution , the sort of trends that you see over hundreds of millions of years , are not merely a kind of adding together of the changes which go on by natural selection within populations and which we can study today , but that some quite different kind of process must be responsible for the major features of evolution , other than natural selection of variants within populations .
889440:47	What I know about palaeotology is n't too much I mean I obviously have to try and know a bit , but it 's not my field - erm in order to test the minor claim , you have to be able to get your hands on some rock which actually consists of continuous sedimentation over long periods of time .
889440:117	What I know about palaeotology is n't too much I mean I obviously have to try and know a bit , but it 's not my field - erm in order to test the minor claim , you have to be able to get your hands on some rock which actually consists of continuous sedimentation over long periods of time .
889450:60	It 's an admirable and exciting piece of work , I think , although I do n't , and I must make this clear , altogether share Peter Williamson 's interpretation of his own data .
889477:116	Indeed it cannot have done if he can lay his hands on enough fossils just in a single surface exposure erm to be able to erm measure the properties of populations , it 's clear there must have been millions of specimens of these beasts present at any one time in the lake .
889493:48	I mean if one was talking about great tits in China , you 'd have to say there are two kinds of great tits .
889543:56	Then a number of things we ca n't follow in the fossil record , but we know must have happened .
889548:11	All those changes must have been happening in parallel with these other ones .
889569:154	erm the I mean we have a pentadactyl limb , whether we climb or run or fly or swim , you can recognise an obvious deep anatomical resemblance between the limbs of organisms behaving as differently as that , and therefore that if we really want to understand evolution we have to understand these erm , I do n't know whether one wants to call them plans or archetypes , or structures , call them what you will .
889572:49	erm however , what about these ? erm let me read you what Darwin had to say erm about and this in fact is erm erm the end of chapter six of The Origin of Species .
889595:12	Next week we must have Brian or Gerry telling you why I 'm wrong and they 'd be as persuasive , or more persuasive than I 'm being , but I ca n't see the case for such a thing as a law of form .
889599:41	And I 've no doubt at all that the answer to that question has to lie in an understanding of the mechanics of development .
889600:23	If it was n't that we had to develop from an egg in every generation , I do n't think that kind of conservatism would be observed .
889690:24	Some of them are going to have to puzzle a little bit hard .
889716:32	And I ca n't remember - I think Michael must have come after A Lovely War , or maybe contemporary with it , I 'm not sure .
889740:9	So somebody must think something of you .
889750:15	I think Sussex has got to find a new , new hat , and got to express itself and demonstrate that it is in no sense relying on twenty five years of erm of erm fairly high reputation that the next twenty five years and the next twenty five years after that are just as challenging , perhaps even more so .
889751:111	Again , I repeat with this problem of unemployment and so on , and the really obscene level of unemployment in this country at the moment - absolutely shocking I think - and I think the universities have to address themselves to that problem .
889763:131	I saw it erm I ran it - I ca n't remember why I was running it , oh I think I wanted to look at an actor erm , oh no , it was at a festival and I had to sit through it and I was very disappointed in it , I found it slow and rather obvious and erm a little lacking in bite .
889766:226	Oh some marvellous performances in it , but really it was Joan Littlewood 's intrinsic concept which was miraculous really , that 's and really I do n't know whether the movie lost a lot as against the play - I think it lost something - the important thing was that millions of people who would never have seen it , had it remained purely as a theatre production , did see what Joan Littlewood had to say , saw her perceptions , her wit , her humanity , and therefore I think it was well worth making .
889780:29	I was a very good movie too , I must say .
889807:172	The great problem we face is that obviously the authorities in South Africa do n't want the picture to be made , and we 're shooting it in Zimbabwe , where we 've been made very welcome , and erm the difficulties is the creation of South Africa in Zimbabwe , which means you have to go all over the place .
889808:38	It 's a very costly business , you know , but it must ring true because of course the actuality 's on our televisions screens every other night and if it does n't have an authentic ring to it then people wo n't accept what the picture has to say .
889808:141	It 's a very costly business , you know , but it must ring true because of course the actuality 's on our televisions screens every other night and if it does n't have an authentic ring to it then people wo n't accept what the picture has to say .
889853:128	I mean by this it was not the sort of preparation which on the one hand Elizabethan erm critics and writers of rhetoric books , or on the other hand Ezra Pound in the twentieth century would advise to the poet that he must learn to turn a good sonnet or write in all the metrical forms , or accomplish himself deftly in the technical devices .
889864:78	The reasons he feels uneasy at the task he 's given himself , of pamphleteering , are first that he 's not he 's had to interrupt his studies and is not get learned enough for his poem , though you will have noticed he considers himself quite learned enough for ecclesiastical politics .
889872:10	Well I have to establish my own virtue and distinction .
889876:24	Indeed , there is - and we must confess it - there is no doubt about Milton 's egoism as a man .
889885:98	Lucidas , I suppose , more than any other poem of Milton 's , and indeed I suppose more than any other poem in English , Lucidas shows us that there does n't have to be a conflict between personal involvement and formal rhetoric .
889921:86	Paradise Lost , like Colmris is a poem with a thesis , but the counter position of the thesis is so powerful that the poem , both these poems , have to be described as the enactment of a conflict , rather than the giving us of the result .
889923:107	The poem sets out to justify the ways of God to men , and what little time is left me will be devoted to justifying the ways of god to men , and we must begin this , sorry we must begin this by a word on on the fall - the way of God the ways of God to men of course are punishing men for the fall .
889923:125	The poem sets out to justify the ways of God to men , and what little time is left me will be devoted to justifying the ways of god to men , and we must begin this , sorry we must begin this by a word on on the fall - the way of God the ways of God to men of course are punishing men for the fall .
889927:54	That comes from Milton 's Latin Treaties on Christian Doctrine , and you can see he certainly must have felt he 'd found his subject .
889930:25	Well , I am alas going to have to leave out my discussion of God in Paradise Lost , the question of whether , by presenting the obedience to God you can somehow make it more palatable to the readers ' tastes than you could if it was entirely thought of as a secular morality .
889950:94	And to justify the ways of God to men with such honesty , that is to say with such a complete account of what the price is which would have to be paid , is of course no longer to justify but to enact the actual conflict .
889952:109	And that , of course , is why in the end , though we can all read Paradise Lost alike , and we can all in a certain sense respond to Paradise Lost alike , we must come to our final conclusions about the poem in terms of our own values .
890000:36	I think parental anxieties are something with which one must have great sympathy because very often the anxiety is not so much an anxiety about the child , it 's an anxiety about the parent .
890007:172	If the parent feels they know a system that they have heard or read is successful , and if they try it out on the child and the child obviously enjoys it , if it becomes part of a game , then I ca n't see any harm in it , but I think the parent has to be scrupulously honest as to whether the child is enjoying it .
890018:134	Now if a parent can have introduced the child via nursery school to that amount of other children , then I think there should be very little trauma , but that is n't to say that as the child gets older they do n't have to do things .
890019:15	But if a child has to do something because they can understand the end a which they 're aiming , in the way that a footballer has to train , or a boxer has to train , then it becomes easier to do the equivalent of training .
890019:109	But if a child has to do something because they can understand the end a which they 're aiming , in the way that a footballer has to train , or a boxer has to train , then it becomes easier to do the equivalent of training .
890020:90	One of the difficulties is that the end state is so far removed from the average child that it is very difficult for them to see why they have to learn to read , but if they can realize that if they learn to read in those houses where they have it they 'll be able to read the Radio Times and know what the television programmes are , that at least is motivating .
890021:108	I mean reading as to be put in a context and a context that is , in fact , enjoyable to the child , not something that just happens at school that they have to do , hence one they go to school the value of parents hearing the children read , because then the parent is also involved and one does n't get this split between home and school .
890036:15	One does n't always have to make those assumptions , of course .
890047:59	I think it would be very exciting if they were changing , but I 'm afraid one has to be a reluctant revolutionary at the moment - there really is no evidence for that view .
890048:243	I think really what happens when you go into the past is not so much that the laws that we now use change , but we just find that there are many more new rules and particles and things that can happen , so the things that we know are the same , but there are many , many more different types of interaction and particle in nature which we have no experience of , which we have to take into account .
890049:53	If we go back to the first few minutes , or maybe even the first few seconds , there must have been an incredibly high density of matter near that point ?
890113:11	But then we have to move with Ulysses to a huge spinning-top of words which defies such judgements and leaves us clutching at apparently familiar images which so sooner appear than they are gone .
890115:48	If then we have uneasy feelings about modern art , it looks as if Joyce must confirm them a thousandfold .
890118:97	And then again if agonisings about modern are seem to take us in one direction , the banning of books as reminded us , takes us in quite another , and we have to remember that for all practical purposes it was indeed a banned book for nearly fifteen years , from the Twenties into the Thirties .
890134:13	What I have to say would bear essentially on the four works named , and would be grouped round three notions which I shall call language as rescue , language as screen , and language as replay .
890144:56	He had never felt like that himself towards any woman , but he knew that such a feeling must be love .
890179:29	If he is to write at all he must , in the final irony , turn to language .
890197:7	It must be curious to hear after their own strong bases - connoisseurs .
890217:77	At the same time , this screen , these games with and in words , can even now frighten off those readers who feel they must always know where they are when they read , or irritate those who see the games as a form of deliberate teasing or provocation .
890262:65	He is a husband who recites with dull pain the continuing succession of his wife 's lovers , while he must comfort himself with fantasies - his own , or the kind printed on cheap paper .
890276:55	And so gently , uncertainly , yet doggedly , he makes his way along through this day as , we must suppose , through the whole of his life thus far .
890298:48	As he makes his way along within the quiet desperation of his life , he must reveal himself to us as cuckold , fetishist , masochist , outsider , victim , inferior , loser .
890302:7	Bloom must accept a particular life so that Joyce need not , and Stephen must be shown in his byronic self-deception so that Joyce need not .
890302:41	Bloom must accept a particular life so that Joyce need not , and Stephen must be shown in his byronic self-deception so that Joyce need not .
890312:28	For these above all , the culture insists , must hide their wound beyond the receiving end of experience , whatever their gifts or desires .
890331:43	If we are aware of this , we at least know that it must always have been so .
890358:25	It is to the eye that you must turn if you are to read Finnegans Wake .
890390:46	Sometimes he 's so determined he 's not going to go that we have to forcibly put him out of the door and get him into the car and get him there somehow .
890411:24	There are many adults who 've had to face up to this problem and have , in actual fact , overcome it Susan Hampshire is one ; I believe Hans Anderson , also , has suffered from this difficulty - that with help they can overcome this and live a normal life .
890434:81	If this method is barred because the headmaster does not agree that the child might have a learning difficulty called dyslexia , then the parents will have to go outside the school system and possibly go to the Dyslexia Institute at Staines , where a full assessment is carried out , with a report , which is sent to the parents .
890435:45	Unfortunately this is not part of the National Health Service , and the parents will have to pay a fee .
890442:18	When I started I had to right back to the very beginning and start from three letter words .
890454:8	They must take action and they must feel free to contact us , feel free to put their point of view across to the headmaster and to ask for a psychologist 's report .
890454:23	They must take action and they must feel free to contact us , feel free to put their point of view across to the headmaster and to ask for a psychologist 's report .
890455:9	And they must join with other parents who 've got a similar difficulty , so that we can fight this very wide cause .
890471:8	He must now , by my reckoning , be nearly a hundred years old , but in no way does his enthusiasm for life appear diminished .
890484:25	Well I 've been here , it must be thirty five years .
890488:10	Well you must be getting on for a hundred , because I believe you were in the Boar War , were n't you ?
890510:21	It 's very difficult , I had to pay for the sheep when the Chichester was here .
890559:10	Well I must have to try and buy a radio I think .
890559:13	Well I must have to try and buy a radio I think .
890568:158	The growth of the middle classes as industrialization became , got under way , men , more men earned their money , so instead of having two classes , the working class and the upper class who spent their lives in leisure , in idleness , you got another class of people who had to earn their living , but who still made a lot of money .
890570:96	Previously , in the eighteenth and seventeenth centuries , a man himself could dress and show how wealthy he was , and when man started going to work he had to wear a respectable , responsible suit ; he had to put across the image of honesty , of , you know , I 'm , I 'm a respectable man , I 'm decent , I 'm down to earth .
890570:123	Previously , in the eighteenth and seventeenth centuries , a man himself could dress and show how wealthy he was , and when man started going to work he had to wear a respectable , responsible suit ; he had to put across the image of honesty , of , you know , I 'm , I 'm a respectable man , I 'm decent , I 'm down to earth .
890572:140	So the man needed a way of showing how wealthy he was , and he did that by having a large house , by having lots of servants , and also by dressing his wife , I mean by having a wife who did n't have to work , who could stay at home , and wore clothes to show this , so you get the beginning of incredibly impractical clothes which showed that the woman obviously did n't do any work , because it was completely impossible to do any .
890618:7	You had to be the , the perfect woman who was one , who had grown up from the little girl of the eighteen-thirties who was all bouncy and skippy and optimistic ; now she had to be very quiet , she was admired for her innocence , for her delicate nature and her dainty physique .
890618:114	You had to be the , the perfect woman who was one , who had grown up from the little girl of the eighteen-thirties who was all bouncy and skippy and optimistic ; now she had to be very quiet , she was admired for her innocence , for her delicate nature and her dainty physique .
890620:37	She was supposed to be very , very quiet , she had to , I think complete submission was really the key point of women in the eighteen-forties .
890623:151	Full skirts - goodness knows how many petticoats made walking very hard , so all this almost enforced leisure upon them , and this was again part of the duty of the woman to show that she did n't need to work , she did n't in fact even have to lift a finger because the man or her servants would do all this for her .
890631:236	I actually have at the back which I will show in a minute , a costume that was worn by a woman in the eighteen-forties , and it shows how she has kept up with the fashion ; it is a fairly fashionable dress , but it is adapted for real life , for day to day life , for for the life of an ordinary middle class woman who had perhaps one or two servants , but had to do the running of the household herself .
890634:31	But actually , because they were very tight , they had to be whacking great things so that they would n't bend under the pressure .
890647:202	The bodice is quite small , but it 's actually not as , you read about eighteen inch waists , I mean this is nowhere near an eighteen inch waist , and although she would have worn corsets , she obviously did n't wear , you can see there , so much corseting that she could n't move , and that she could n't bend down if she had to .
890712:49	They 're not on show because displaying costume is very difficult , because you have to have very strict environment control ; and light has to be very dim and you have to watch the relative humidity .
890712:76	They 're not on show because displaying costume is very difficult , because you have to have very strict environment control ; and light has to be very dim and you have to watch the relative humidity .
890712:97	They 're not on show because displaying costume is very difficult , because you have to have very strict environment control ; and light has to be very dim and you have to watch the relative humidity .
890713:33	And you ca n't let people touch them so they have to be in glass cases which are hugely expensive and take up a lot of room , and the director is not very interested in costume .
890746:177	That is an opted out school as against the standard state school , which is subject to the overall policies of the Local Education Authority , and indeed it is funded by the Local Education Authority through a formula , and the amount of money that is put into that formula will obviously affect the amount of money the school has to spend , so it 's providing the same range of education within the National Curriculum , but it is not beholden to the Local Authority - that 's the basic difference .
890783:40	And so Mr. Green , I think it was Chris Green , had to he was chairing that meeting and had a double vote .
890808:35	It 's part of an education philosophy which I must remind erm which I must remind you starts off with local financial management of schools within the Education Service erm prior to local financial management County Hall was big brother .
890808:53	It 's part of an education philosophy which I must remind erm which I must remind you starts off with local financial management of schools within the Education Service erm prior to local financial management County Hall was big brother .
890833:54	But at the moment small primary schools may well look at the opting out procedure , and I would have to say to you that in many cases those very small primary schools are receiving , by the wish of the Council , a very substantial subsidy from the Local Education Authority in the manner in which they are funded and
890847:55	Now I believe that in the case of some of our small primary schools , and you have to build into the formula an element of subsidy , it is the size that subsidy which is open to debate .
890874:17	But you know we have to look beyond the first year or two , we have to look at what 's going to happen to that school over a much longer period of time , and quite frankly erm I would feel safer with erm what was called the big brother of the Local Authority .
890874:48	But you know we have to look beyond the first year or two , we have to look at what 's going to happen to that school over a much longer period of time , and quite frankly erm I would feel safer with erm what was called the big brother of the Local Authority .
890905:21	Do you think that all policy must be established on the basis of worst case scenarios ?
890929:7	I have to tell you I am not any sort of an expert on the budgets of grant maintained schools .
890936:5	have to tell Bob whatever he might like to talk about that he turns it to the Poll Tax , the fact of the matter is that the Poll Tax is nothing to do with Oxfordshire County Council .
890938:10	They still have to pre-set the amount of money .
890939:117	This time the District Councils collect it from Community Charges payers , and whether you had a rating systems in place at the moment , or whether you have Community Charge , Bob and his high spending friends would still have to rein in their expenditure and recognise that the people of Oxfordshire cannot keep paying for his profligacy .
890941:37	I do n't want to either , Bill , but I must come back on this , I mean Choppy wants all things and wants to be all things to all men .
890954:51	It gives me great pleasure to announce that that would mean Cherwell District Council would have to disappear as well , and that would be another blip off the horizon erm but that what would happen you would therefore have a smaller authority , who would then become the Education Authority , and that would be would have to be , I think , somewhere in between the current District Council size in Cherwell or the Vale , of what about a hundred thousand , and the present county , which is rather more than half a million .
890954:182	It gives me great pleasure to announce that that would mean Cherwell District Council would have to disappear as well , and that would be another blip off the horizon erm but that what would happen you would therefore have a smaller authority , who would then become the Education Authority , and that would be would have to be , I think , somewhere in between the current District Council size in Cherwell or the Vale , of what about a hundred thousand , and the present county , which is rather more than half a million .
890968:7	You have to remember that on the whole the school is run by the principal and her staff and erm the teaching is related to the National Curriculum .
890970:112	They get advice from the officers of the Local Education Authority , so there 's a number of people who are running things , if you like to put it that way , and they have to have good relationships erm and I must say that erm I have n't seen anything obstructive , particularly on our Board of Governors , from local Councillors and we 've had nothing but help from Local Education Authority officers , and I 'm glad we 're not going to lose that help .
890970:135	They get advice from the officers of the Local Education Authority , so there 's a number of people who are running things , if you like to put it that way , and they have to have good relationships erm and I must say that erm I have n't seen anything obstructive , particularly on our Board of Governors , from local Councillors and we 've had nothing but help from Local Education Authority officers , and I 'm glad we 're not going to lose that help .
891027:56	We are going through enormous changes in the education system at the moment and as Governors we have had to struggle terribly hard to learn how to govern schools as more power and more authority has been devolved to us , and we should have been spending this year erm working together on learning how to run a more successful school , and instead erm we 've had to waste a hell of a lot of time on really what was an absolute political nonsense and irrelevance , and I am glad we can turn aside from that .
891027:209	We are going through enormous changes in the education system at the moment and as Governors we have had to struggle terribly hard to learn how to govern schools as more power and more authority has been devolved to us , and we should have been spending this year erm working together on learning how to run a more successful school , and instead erm we 've had to waste a hell of a lot of time on really what was an absolute political nonsense and irrelevance , and I am glad we can turn aside from that .
891047:159	We 've heard a lot about the accuracy of the continuing bombardments , but erm anybody who 's been in a war will tell you that erm once you 're in a war situation , things do n't always go the way you expect them to , in fact there has to be an element of luck and erm the accuracy of bombing in particular erm sometimes leaves something to be required .
891067:24	I sympathise with the Jews , they must have a home .
891099:20	Yes , I mean I have to say that if you 're , if you 're a member of a family and one of your members of the family is out in the Gulf , then you 're obviously going to be
891130:21	Like you know I had to think well what the hell am I going to do with her now , you know , and , you know , get her out of this mischief , and out of that mischief and you know , from bashing her baby brother up , and you know .
891153:69	Yesterday things looked pretty hopeful but that it would n't take too long to get the whole thing sorted out , but I must admit things seem to be escalating and getting a lot worse now .
891163:159	erm I mean as I said before , I do n't have relatives out in the Gulf , but I feel immensely for these men that are out there , men and women , and also for the news reporters , I mean nobody 's actually said what an awful job it must be for these news reporters and sort of camera crews that are actually erm doing this sort of wonderful job of bringing us back here all this information .
891234:40	erm That seems to me a little bit odd that that has to be put on twice to the erm exclusion of other programmes .
891247:17	And it takes it must take a lot longer to produce a plane like the Tornado and a Spitfire or a Lancaster in erm the days of erm nineteen forty three
891255:12	Because we must remember that Iraq has already had an eight years war and they 're used to a war , they used to withstanding a war and it was the only reason that Britain survived in the last world war because it could withstand attack , and wait and wait until they were ready to counter attack .
891257:82	So , you know , if you 're going to talk in terms of losses , then it does suggest , heaven forbid that the allies have got to lose a tremendous number of aircraft before the equation sort of balances .
891276:97	It does at the moment according to the reports , everything is aimed at the control and the command network and also and obviously at the military targets , so we 'll just have to wait and see
891295:53	Yes , but I well yes I mean this is a judgement each of us has to make erm it 's a judgement if you 've got a member of your family involved in this , then obviously your attitude is going to be totally different from the rest of us that are n't .
891311:33	The main reason , main thing is presuming that there must have been refreshments for all these people , probably might have been just a buffet or cup of coffee , or I expect there was probably a lunch laid on , I want to know who footed the bill for the lunch ?
891324:53	Ah that 's not so bad then , I thought perhaps the poor taxpayer was going to have to foot the bill .
891330:46	Oh well that 's good enough then , I thought perhaps if the taxpayer had to pay , I would n't be very pleased
891393:79	And the advice that we got was that if we wanted to establish proper ownership and control of that land again , we would have to seek a High Court action , possibly the House of Lords as well , and that total cost would be in the region of a quarter of a million pounds in legal costs , and we also then stood the , well risk of losing the case as well , so we could have spent two hundred and fifty thousand pounds for nothing .
891415:7	They must have got a piggy bank somewhere .
891431:20	And that is what we had to legally challenge in the courts .
891437:25	But it was I mean you have to admit erm and I 'm I 'll bring Mr Power in and let him speak for himself , but you have to admit that it from what we 've just heard , it started in nineteen seventy four , it 's been going on a long time .
891437:94	But it was I mean you have to admit erm and I 'm I 'll bring Mr Power in and let him speak for himself , but you have to admit that it from what we 've just heard , it started in nineteen seventy four , it 's been going on a long time .
891488:113	erm I enlisted in the Air Force December thirty nine , and I had six and a half years taken out of my life for helping with the war effort , and hopefully my sons and my grandsons will not have to go into another war .
891512:30	And you as the poor customer are going to have to argue the toss as to whether it 's a defect or faulty workmanship , so the chances are you wo n't be able to claim .
891516:40	They 're saying it 's wear and tear and he 'll have to pay himself .
891592:100	I mean in the excitement of buying a car you 're not going to read the small print , you 're not going to read the little bit that says you must have the oil changed every three thousand miles and unless you do it within two hundred and fifty miles of that and not only that , you must send evidence of the service by recorded delivery to you .
891592:179	I mean in the excitement of buying a car you 're not going to read the small print , you 're not going to read the little bit that says you must have the oil changed every three thousand miles and unless you do it within two hundred and fifty miles of that and not only that , you must send evidence of the service by recorded delivery to you .
891626:87	But that poor customer , John - I am sorry to keep going back to you on it , I 'm just seeking clarification - that poor customer has got to prove to your satisfaction that it 's a mechanical breakdown and not a result of what they 've done to it or somebody 's , at any time , negligence in assembly .
891631:93	I think you 've got to you 've got to accept that it is a legally binding contract , all of the policies , and I think you have to realise that in any arrangement that you make erm where there is a degree of legality , there has to be parameters put down .
891631:156	I think you 've got to you 've got to accept that it is a legally binding contract , all of the policies , and I think you have to realise that in any arrangement that you make erm where there is a degree of legality , there has to be parameters put down .
891643:12	You 've had to go to a specialist engineer in support of your case and to argue your case , and you 're still arguing over it .
891665:41	The other point I 'm trying to say is that we have to insure with a Department of Trade approved insurer , so that should anything , for any reason , ever happen to ourselves or a company , then the insurance company is still responsible for the claims and will meet them .
891712:26	It does sound to me was there has to have been given a reason as to why the claim was rejected .
891716:104	But I would say that if obviously a head gasket goes on a vehicle and somebody knowing that fact continues to drive the vehicle , yes - and damages their engine - yes I must say we would reject liability .
891741:123	We write to them normally within seven days , ask them to read it , clarifying exactly the policy they 've got , give them the option to pull out if they should so wish , and in fairness I have got to say that we 've been doing that now for the last eighteen months .
891744:15	I think there must be a general acceptance of the insurance .
891746:67	Like , for instance , can they bargain with you to alter any of the exclusion clauses , or do they have to take it as it is and that 's that ?
891760:65	I 've I 've got your range of one to six here , John , and I 'm not I must stress I 'm not singling you out - I mean your company is fairly typical of what 's happening in this area - but the main difference between one and six is that erm two and six is that number two covers for two hundred part up to two hundred pounds
891800:59	I think also on the inherent fault situation , I mean when somebody buys a vehicle the vehicle has to be of a standard obviously and if there are problems there then obviously people appreciate the fact that they can go back and this is really the point of dealing with a reputable dealer from the word go .
891823:7	You must have some idea how much a customer would be expected to pay for it .
891846:13	Yes , you must have many people who do n't claim at all on this insurance , they have no need to claim or just decide not to .
891852:91	There 's possibly , oh I do n't know , there 's probably five that have got say punctures or fanbelts gone , or erm service items which we have to say that are not covered , but that 's a ball park figure .
891926:195	As far as Kuwait is concerned we 'd like to see our country free again and this gives us the type of hope we have been wanting for the past six months , and I am sure for the people inside Kuwait - because I was there for about three weeks prior to the after the invasion I was there and I had to escape that country .
891929:48	We ran out of water and some other friends ran out of water and we had to help each other and we were getting stuck in the sand and the heat was very high because it was in August and it was around noon time , so erm some people actually turned back erm they could n't continue , unfortunately ; they are friends of ours .
891930:38	They could n't continue , so it was quite difficult and we had to avoid the Iraqui army as we did that .
891950:15	He says you have to have erm nerves of steel .
891951:48	By now they are probably nerves of iron because , you know , you have to co-exist with an army like that he has to really take it fairly easy because they can be quite rude and , you know , shove you around get whatever they want and very harmful methods .
891951:78	By now they are probably nerves of iron because , you know , you have to co-exist with an army like that he has to really take it fairly easy because they can be quite rude and , you know , shove you around get whatever they want and very harmful methods .
891952:13	So you just have to take it fairly easy , you know , calm down and yes and and everything will go well .
891985:41	But what about the argument that in order to save Kuwait the allies have to destroy it .
892043:40	I believe my friend is shaking her head yes , so we must have been also part of the route .
892077:24	in and out of Kuwait they never have to their only restrictions at any time , never , even if Kuwait had a financial crisis because of the crash of its stock market one expected that people might move their capital outside the country because of it , but there was no restrictions , no control , everybody was free , you could walk in and out of the country
892083:42	For the international people there are civil laws , by which they companies have to provide what we call indemnities for the person who works and these indemnities go according to certain formulas , which is known by everybody , and it 's in a way protecting them after they leave .
892087:7	Everybody had to leave , almost much poorer than when he came into Kuwait , including ex-patriots .
892090:92	Yes , but very restricted erm in other words if you look at the history of Kuwait for the time that we received or we got our independence , we had to start our nationalisation process as an independent country .
892092:56	With time , as it became more lucrative a country for people to come , obviously the country had to be more restrictive about providing the nationality .
892096:58	Well , it depends , because there 's a committee that is responsible for this and you have to bring many erm recommendation letters and you have to bring a lot of documents and eye witnesses to go by this rule .
892096:84	Well , it depends , because there 's a committee that is responsible for this and you have to bring many erm recommendation letters and you have to bring a lot of documents and eye witnesses to go by this rule .
892148:148	It is the people , the parliament actually , because the Emir when he proposes a cabinet the parliament can accept the cabinet , or change , or request it to be changed and even the Prime Minister , which is proposed or nominated by the Emir , the cabinet has to approve him , and together they they run the business of the government .
892150:63	The national assembly , up to only a certain period of time , according to the constitution , and then again the parliament has to come back again into the picture .
892154:25	erm only the Emir , and he has to give very erm strict reasons for it and he sends it back to the parliament to look into it again and when it comes back the second time the Emir can pass it .
892158:20	Yes , I think he has to pass it .
892168:67	Yes , Dehad , you mean the political life of the country is devoid of you 're erm whatever you have to offer ?
892194:34	That 's putting your question a rather smart way I must say .
892204:55	You have things like heredity , marriages , divorces , erm some way of life which has to do with Islamic doctrine that you do and some dispute happens , you take it to the Islamic courts and they have religious judges who take it in that context and they go according to the laws of Islam .
892227:148	On the contrary , there was attempts to the life of our Emir during the Iraq/Iran war because we were taking relatively trying to be neutral there , and there was a bomb attack on him , and he personally survived it , a few others died , and it had to do directly with the Iran/Iraq war .
892238:7	That must be one of the largest settlements of Palestinians .
892261:125	I believe the Kuwaiti people naturally are a peace loving people and we will never forget that erm good nature of us and we will try to capitalise on that and maintain peace and Kuwait become again a country which has to have peaceful causes everybody .
892328:13	Now I 'd have to say when I saw the report in the Observer , which was a couple of months ago , the rape in the quad report , my feeling was that this was a national newspaper picking on Oxford because Oxford and sex makes great headlines and it was going to be a good sell , and I felt that it was inappropriate in that sexual harassment is a problem in other campuses .
892329:10	Now I have to say that since I 've seen a report from the Students ' Union and have read it through , I was actually shocked at the level of harassment that that report seemed to indicate .
892411:33	Yes , he 's a very enlightened man , I must say .
892428:15	I think we have to accept there 's going to be a period of transition .
892439:95	Well , I think the first starting point is asking men to be self-aware and if one of the untoward consequences of that self-awareness is self-consciousness , then we 'll just have to live with that .
892441:56	Now I 'm not saying that two wrongs make a right , and the fact that women have had to put up with this means than men just have to put up with it in their turn .
892441:89	Now I 'm not saying that two wrongs make a right , and the fact that women have had to put up with this means than men just have to put up with it in their turn .
892464:8	We have to tackle it in two directions , and I think that education is going to be incredibly important in terms of trying to create a more appropriate atmosphere in the colleges , you know , because at the end of the day that 's where people spend an enormous amount of their time .
892471:52	Part of that picture that 's coming out about the behaviour of males in colleges has to do with alcohol .
892495:43	I mean I think that does you know in honesty one has to recognize that alcohol is a very major part of Oxford life in some ways , you know for many of us .
892502:136	Now I think it also is important that we recognize that as a university and as colleges we have a responsibility for the sort of environment , the education environment , that we provide our students , but I think we also have to remember that these students are eighteen years old when they come up , they are twenty one when they graduate , and many of the students are older than that , they are graduate students and they are young adults .
892510:156	But I think that to allow those two sort of issues to get too inseparable , as it were , to so that we simply regard ourselves as being in a position to issue directives about behaviour , which do n't acknowledge that these are young people who have to learn to be autonomous , then we get ourselves onto a hiding for nothing .
892511:212	I mean personally I think one of the difficulties in the colleges is that they do still have a sense of being at schools , and when you have an atmosphere which is like school you 're tacitly given people permission to act as if they were at school , and so we have a and that activity may not always be very adult , so we have to find a way of changing the environment of the colleges .
892540:187	distinction between attempting to respond on the basis of behaviour , or a response based on whether or not there 's a victim , can carry you a certain way , but I was just thinking of some of the discussions we 've had in college recently about the sort of behaviour with which we feel uncomfortable , and I have to say that sometimes it would be difficult to identify a given victim or , you know , a group of given victims .
892567:62	Well , we 've clearly seen that this is out in the open now and people are going to have to deal with it .
892618:31	Yes , I think as adults one thing we have to do is actually trust the wisdom of our children to let us know , to give us the cues to when they need to talk or express their fears in some way erm I mean that 's our duty not to stop them talking , not to stop them asking questions , but to be aware of when they may have fears .
892634:44	Yes , I think talking about the stiff upper lippers I think we have to work with people where they are an if that 's where they are at the moment , that 's fine .
892654:21	erm I mean it really must make them feel like the world 's gone haywire .
892675:112	They 're sense of self is such that they do n't see that they have a self to assert , perhaps , or that they are not valid enough as a person , which obviously must stem erm from their early childhood experiences , and from the adults that surrounded them when they were growing and developing that sense of who they are .
892695:103	Yes , I think I agree with everything that Elizabeth said , and I think this is why erm one of the things I very much feel is that it has to start with the schools , as well as at home , of course , when children are young .
892747:126	I mean there 's no doubt that in human terms that child needs that fifty pence more than you do , but we do n't because I mean there 's a level in which we ca n't because we have to somehow psychologically protect ourselves , and I believe we do do that by convincing ourselves that somehow people out there are not people in the same way that we are .
892769:7	We have to answer questions to our children as to why we 've got a siren that 's visible for everybody around , right level with the bedrooms , in the middle of an estate .
892778:20	Yes , I think we have to take any situation like this , not just the major ones like war , but any situation that we come across and use it as a real opportunity for learning , and maybe for adults to be able to do the things that they did n't do when they were children , which is why now we often respond as child in these situations .
892784:114	They learn , as Elizabeth said earlier , you know , we 're models and children learn more by what we do more than what we preach , so you know we do have to repair what we did n't learn maybe earlier on .
892785:8	We have to repair the damage in a way erm but it does n't mean to say we do n't not do it with our children now .
892797:105	Yes , I 've just remembered the point I was going to make erm I 've certainly felt from Frankie Rickford 's article that there was this myth , adults have to get it right , that we have to know the answers .
892797:129	Yes , I 've just remembered the point I was going to make erm I 've certainly felt from Frankie Rickford 's article that there was this myth , adults have to get it right , that we have to know the answers .
892846:15	What credentials do you have to decide how those millions of pounds should be spent ?
892872:7	It must have been quite a shock for you all of a sudden to be dealing with millions of pounds on the budget .
892877:34	mhm Well , Eva Barnes , what special credentials do you have to bandy around figures that are millions of pounds .
892916:151	I think erm you 've got to say that it is not easy to find people to give the commitment to local government work these days and I think a partial remuneration of the expense that they incur is a very reasonable thing for the public to have to meet .
892925:151	We had some very , very moving speeches yesterday , as we had had at previous meetings , which made it quite clear that a few pounds were vital and crucial to people 's lives , so we thought it was a a gesture that was worth making , and I have to say that probably our group also includes people on , as members , as Councillors , who are themselves on income support , so it was a move which was n't without it 's personal difficulties for us either .
892937:9	So we had to as far as all the schools and colleges were concerned erm there was a previous Council agreement that erm increments , that is the progression of Council employees through their salary scales , that had to be funded from what we call base budgets this year , so the budgets of the the delegated budgets of schools had to erm bear that cost along with everybody else .

892937:190	So we had to as far as all the schools and colleges were concerned erm there was a previous Council agreement that erm increments , that is the progression of Council employees through their salary scales , that had to be funded from what we call base budgets this year , so the budgets of the the delegated budgets of schools had to erm bear that cost along with everybody else .
892939:96	That meant in practise , I speak in the primary sector I think there 's five hundred and forty six thousand of the delegated budget taken out , and I will have to - if you will allow me a minute
892962:10	Children will have to pay about ten pence extra ?
893025:8	We had to , of course , make a one million pound reduction following the S S A the final S S A announcement which Heseltine made about three weeks ago , but we were always at the capping limit , and I think
893060:165	I I observe that the Liberal Democrats have made a complete U turn in their previous adherence to providing a steady stream of services to the people of Oxford , and by setting for a budget below the capping level you are taking out of funds available to people things that do n't necessarily have to be taken out .
893075:34	You were probably right to ask what qualifications Councillors had to make budgets like this .
893088:75	Now Labour have , in fact , under provided , I think , by about five hundred thousand for those provisions , which will have to be done .
893128:85	But erm on the other hand we do actually have empty spaces in our old people 's homes , so whilst you will have people who may have to move a bit , we 're not actually reducing the number of occupied beds in the whole old person 's home sector
893131:7	You have to have that in context as well .
893160:112	erm certainly the message coming back to us when we went out to consultation on this was not absolutely one hundred per cent by everybody in education that this was a service which had to be had to have no cuts whatever .
893160:122	erm certainly the message coming back to us when we went out to consultation on this was not absolutely one hundred per cent by everybody in education that this was a service which had to be had to have no cuts whatever .
893178:57	It 's particularly difficult for those of us who did n't negotiate this budget , who now have to try and find what
893194:60	It will mean that there will be a reduction in the amount of money that that school will have to run its sixth form , just as there is a reduction in the amount of money that a primary school is going to have to run its school .
893194:133	It will mean that there will be a reduction in the amount of money that that school will have to run its sixth form , just as there is a reduction in the amount of money that a primary school is going to have to run its school .
893210:55	We believe that in education we have retained the core provision for the education service and we have to look at what we will call the peripheral areas to to see where savings and reductions have to be made .
893210:111	We believe that in education we have retained the core provision for the education service and we have to look at what we will call the peripheral areas to to see where savings and reductions have to be made .
893219:56	Okay , let 's John said why did I reduce it and you have n't , I have to say , really explained to people why we are doing what we are doing now , why we are n't here discussing why there 's another half million in the budget .
893223:10	because it must be incomprehensible to people who are already paying very high Poll Taxes .
893255:15	What I 've had to do this year , or what I 've chosen to do this year
893265:59	erm I cannot deny that erm they will not be received at all well by those that have to pay them .
893267:15	Well , they 'll have to pay more .
893272:114	Everybody says that 's what 's going to happen , but erm when it 's been done in the past I 've not had any figures produced that indicate that the service provision has had to fall off because of increased charges .
893304:21	Well on that note we 'll have to draw this one to a close , but I think the debate will run quite a bit .
893324:70	We are one and a half million pounds better off from that , and the compulsory redundancy problem has gone erm I 'd have to explain the list to you , though , to give a proper context , and maybe that 's what I should
893327:27	Well , in simple terms , erm we have to find from a range of measures two million pounds , which will then be ploughed back in to improving other aspects of services , and the big things on this list , and some of the most controversial , are the following .
893333:15	But they 'll also have to pay fifty p for transportation ?
893359:30	For deciding who is exempt and who has to pay .
893363:137	You could have a family of maybe erm an older carer with a mentally handicapped son or daughter who receives various allowances , but whom the total income for that family is such that it is so low because of special circumstances , maybe the mother has to have special heating , or special diets , or whatever , as to be logical that we waive some or all of the charge .
893396:41	My accountant is n't sitting here on my shoulder , and I 'd have to ask her , Bill , but it 's certainly we do n't assume a hundred per cent take up for the purposes of estimating like this .
893423:29	But I do agree that people out there must keep wondering how do they know that we are as , as it were , as slim as we can be .
893424:15	Yes , and they have to take your word from it .
893443:7	We have to do some pre-planning with those people , so that they know what their jobs are , how the systems are going to work , what the priorities are .
893449:86	It 's we 're very conscious that erm the costs that we 've incurred we need to keep strapped down to a minimum , but we have to manage a forty million pound organisation and you cannot do this on the back of an envelope .
893461:43	What it means for the homes is that they 're going to have to take a what we 've been doing over the last two or three years is gradually improving the staffing levels in our elderly people 's homes , because the dependency levels in those homes are getting very high .
893506:14	It 'll we have to run it down slowly over the course of the year .
893529:57	You 're dead right , closing down a service of this kind is controversial and very difficult and has to be handled very sensitively .
893545:8	They had to make policy on the hoof and they reprieved that place .
893587:102	If they want to take the opportunity to erm move to Newcastle , to be near their relatives , they 'll have that choice as well , and it 's if we have to make difficult choices of this kind , then it 's more - I 'm sorry to keep using the word logical , but it is - it 's logical to choose this one than to choose one of the remoter homes in the county that serves a local populace where there is no alternative .
893593:61	Just aside , we 're upgrading one of our elderly people 's homes elsewhere in the county and we 've had to empty the home and move the people to an empty home for six months .
893636:7	We have to register them .
893652:23	And that 's money we have to spend , and it in a way that was a controversial decision because members of the Council were genuinely concerned about spending money on what might be seen to be central services , when they were having to face not improving staffing in elderly persons ' homes .
893654:26	But there are new regulations which we have to bring in .
893664:11	We will have to , by law , respond to them , but you ca n't see the Children Act outside of the context of what we 're already doing with our other Children 's Services , as you know from previous discussions we 've had and from keeping track in the papers , over the last eighteen months we 've been recruiting more foster carers , reducing the number of children 's homes , developing preventative services rather than receiving children into care .
893695:24	That since January I now I have to put two stamps on a week , which makes it eight ninety a week , right ?
893723:146	It seems like you got there 's a logic , there are arguments behind what you 're doing , and you 're equalising things certainly , but I suppose what comes to mind is this phrase to rob Peter to pay Paul , and it must be very difficult to explain to the people in the old folks home when it 's being closed , I 'm sorry , you 're doing this so that somebody else in a different part of the country will have a better quality of life .
893729:21	Remember the County Council has had to find ten million , and to a certain extent , therefore , Social Services has been protected by the County Council acknowledging what you 've just said , the pressures on it and the importance of its services .
893734:15	If this year we have to stabilize in this way , do these things , then that 's not a bad achievement compared with what we set out with three months ago .
893818:21	Well I tell him he must go , and if he does n't I just open the door wide to let the cigarette smell out and erm course then he as I say , I ca n't tell you what he calls me , but erm
893876:23	And to be really frank , one has to say when those kind of things come out in the open one has to say has the church got its priorities right ?
893876:69	And to be really frank , one has to say when those kind of things come out in the open one has to say has the church got its priorities right ?
893969:52	The erm help available is in many ways decreasing erm I 'm afraid we have to drag politics into it sooner or later , but central government funding , or lack of it , erm to my mind lies at the bottom of many of these problems .
893976:165	We 've tried all sorts of things erm and we 've erm sort of erm included erm Lesley 's Elmore Support Team has come and talked to him and tried to support him as well , so over the years we have done all sorts of things to try and support him , as I have to try and support all sorts of people .
893979:73	I do n't know how many of them are genuine , or how many of them are not genuine , and I have to deal with them over and over again .
894013:109	Children leaving home because they 've been abused physically or sexually erm or verbally erm the breakdown in the quality of family life has also got something to do with all this business and that has got to be addressed as well , and money wo n't change that .
894014:7	There has got to to be some genuine changes in our erm willingness to work hard at our family life and not to give in easily at the challenges that so often break our homes up .
894019:15	erm I have had to do in my work quite a lot of work coming up against that act , so to speak .
894042:27	How about all the work you do must bring you right up against a lot of raw emotion .
894065:56	Just now and again when they do get , you know , just past you , you just have to say now look go or else I 'm going to call the police , and they go .
894121:126	He 's in a sense living there is in indictment of an attitude and the love and the care that the church and a society that proclaims to be civilized has for itself , and I think we 'll have to leave it there .
894205:53	I 'd like to get your response to what the Conservative , Peter Audley Miller , has had to say .
894208:196	And it does seem to me that erm the minute you suggest to a Parish Council who has already complained about illegal encampments on roadsides and laybys that there is a good site in their patch , there is an immediate reaction , and I am thoroughly convinced that this reaction is based on a fear that is actually based on ignorance , and that we have to remember that travellers of any description - and I do n't categorise them like Peter does - travellers of any description are human beings .
894216:13	We do not have to provide sites for them , but we may have to very shortly because they themselves are going to the High Court to seek legal definition of their status and their due .
894216:43	We do not have to provide sites for them , but we may have to very shortly because they themselves are going to the High Court to seek legal definition of their status and their due .
894225:33	If you are not a designated area , then you have to go through the due process of Court Orders and notices and move out in twenty eight days or something , you know , it 's a long , expensive process , which does not have to take place when a district is designated .
894225:132	If you are not a designated area , then you have to go through the due process of Court Orders and notices and move out in twenty eight days or something , you know , it 's a long , expensive process , which does not have to take place when a district is designated .
894367:5	has got to remember that a duty was put upon the County Councils of Great Britain in nineteen sixty eight to provide sites for gipsies , and here were are in nineteen ninety one - that 's damn near thirty years further on , and we 're still looking for sites to get the county designated .
894370:134	Now Somerset is a long way away , but the first stopping place that they can find where they will be left undisturbed for a few days is in the Vale , and very shortly the Vale will be designated , so they 'll have to travel even further into west Oxford , which is going to be , if we 're not careful , the only undesignated district in the whole of the south of England , and I would n't want to be a resident of west Oxford in these circumstances .
894371:7	Peter must not talk about erm the provision that has been made .
894372:7	He must not imply that the Conservative group have been working actively hard and long and finding sites .
894430:18	I mean what you have to remember is that we have not made a decision about Rockhill Farm .
894468:15	And where they have to come out onto the road before the Shilton dip , where they actually come from Scrubs Lane onto the road , it 's on a right angle bend and , you know , we 've had several mishaps down there .
894537:167	If the government thinks that they 're going to solve the problem by just lashing out four hundred thousand pounds for sixteen pitches , then they are certainly mistaken , because the mere fact of these people 's business , whether they 're in scrap , whether they 're dealing in furniture , means that they must be on the move all the time .
894620:13	erm and we have to persuade people , really through the medium of , of P R ; through good editorials , through the world 's press and T V erm that it 's safe and then , through the medium of advertising - which is why we 've got a lot of extra money - we have to persuade the world that it 's affordable .
894620:178	erm and we have to persuade people , really through the medium of , of P R ; through good editorials , through the world 's press and T V erm that it 's safe and then , through the medium of advertising - which is why we 've got a lot of extra money - we have to persuade the world that it 's affordable .
894621:70	The pound has been very strong recently , particularly in the United States , where they 've got a weak dollar , and we have to put over the message that there are tremendous deals to be had erm both in air fares and when you get here in terms of hotel rates erm and in terms of prices of food and so forth .
894633:16	So we really do have to fight fiercely , and to do that , of course , erm one of the things that we do I think most effectively is to bring waves of foreign journalists here to write about how beautiful erm Britain is and indeed into your area , into the Oxford area , erm we 've got the Canadian T V crew coming next week , who 'll be filming and erm making erm documentary films for Canadian T V , which should be screened fairly quickly .
894643:14	Well , I have to say , I mean it is a fairly gloomy picture , is it not , with the recession and then the Gulf war , which we said both of those there are signs well certainly the war , we hope , is over .
894701:73	They should be able to hold prices and they certainly should n't got up by as much as they thought they might have to put them up .
894702:76	Now I know as I was saying a few moments ago , I travelled to the continent just recently , and I know we had to pay a surcharge on the flight .
894705:29	As the fuel prices come down they should n't have to surcharge , but again that 's something they 'll be looking at over the next couple of weeks .
894726:81	I think , you know , the erm the Tourist Boards have taken the industry by the scruff of the neck and said look you must have standards , you must have quality , and you must be price competitive .
894726:95	I think , you know , the erm the Tourist Boards have taken the industry by the scruff of the neck and said look you must have standards , you must have quality , and you must be price competitive .
894726:112	I think , you know , the erm the Tourist Boards have taken the industry by the scruff of the neck and said look you must have standards , you must have quality , and you must be price competitive .
894731:48	You were there , but now you and other representatives from the other local Tourist Boards have got to go out and spread the message .
894732:52	That 's very true and they have a the industry itself , you know , now has to pick itself up and say right we , you know , and it 's very easy to talk oneself into recession and January and February , normally fairly dull months anyway , we are now , on March the first , Saint David 's Day , at the brink of a season which could be one of the best seasons they ever have .
894739:81	Do you think that perhaps this is going to be difficult and , if we do n't get back to those levels , then presumably you have to encourage local British people to , to make up the leeway so speak , because if you do n't it means hotels , restaurants , all kinds of businesses , could be in difficulty .
894750:117	I mean I know there 's always an argument , especially here in Oxford , that people just come , look round the colleges and they 're gone again , but having said that some of them must spend some money .
894757:52	But what the industry itself - that 's the hotels and the erm attractions - now have got to combine with us because we ca n't do this for nothing , you know , they will get erm from us , all our members , to the fact that they can buy media space at fifty per cent off .
894846:174	I also think that erm it 's up to erm us - I mean if you think of us as a whole travel industry - to really take a look at what we are providing and compare it with what is provided in other countries ; the standards of service , how long do you have to wait for a meal when you 're sitting down to eat in a restaurant , what are people used to in France and Germany and the USA ?
894864:15	I think it must do that .
894893:66	Now when you do this sort of assessment do you take into consideration the amount of money I have to pay to go and stay a night at a place like this ?
894895:26	Yes , because the inspector who goes has to pay that price .
894899:7	He has to pay that price .
894900:7	We have to pay the hotel fee , because the hotel does n't know that he is an inspector , or she is an inspector .
894940:48	And look at the heritage Oxford has got , and look at what Windsor has to offer , just to quote two examples .
894964:169	I mean you ask what it 's like erm being a member of the majority Labour group , being the leader of the City Council , it 's extremely hard work , it 's an enormous responsibility , and on many occasions it 's extremely frustrating because the amount of freedom that the City Council has to decide its policy and decide its spending priorities is reducing all the time .
894983:10	We would have to look very carefully at this .
894994:23	I mean the question that has to be faced is that when you talk about cutting the costs in local government you also have to talk about the services which councils deliver , and you ca n't get something for nothing .
894994:82	I mean the question that has to be faced is that when you talk about cutting the costs in local government you also have to talk about the services which councils deliver , and you ca n't get something for nothing .
895045:10	Well I must come back .
895061:97	They 've done it by an alteration in the way local government finance works , so that the cost of providing new council housing and the cost of maintaining existing council housing has to be met entirely from the rent paid by existing council tenants , and erm a certain amount of Government subsidy .
895075:55	In fact initially the erm if we 'd followed Government guidelines exactly , the rents would have had to have gone up by even more , by about twelve pounds a week , but because erm we were able to erm manage the finances erm more carefully , we were able to reduce that increase to seven pounds a week , but none of the Labour Councillors would say that that increase is acceptable .
895076:19	We did n't want to have to put forward an increase so that was as high as that .
895082:31	I think it is very sad they 've had to do it that way .
895085:134	We know we 're taking in some erm five hundred more council houses , and we know that the rents of those , as they come in , are considerably higher than those of our own , and the rent rise they will have to suffer will be very little in comparison with the one that the City Council is putting off .
895101:167	We make sure and many of our tenants , of course , are in receipt of housing benefit , those on the lowest incomes , and for them housing benefit will meet most , if not all , of the increase , but there are many tenants who do n't get housing benefit who will have to pay the increase themselves .
895151:8	We must get the situation straight that the County Council is the ruling authority , we are only a subsidiary as a county and we get our problems on our traffic and our highways as we are only agents to the County Council , and the County Council control the education of Social Services .
895154:37	We would erm take out all superfluous posts and we 'd have to find out what they were .
895193:20	erm sixty eight extra staff we had to take on in order to implement the Poll Tax compared with the implementation of the rates .
895194:7	We have to take on the people that are necessary to deliver the services .
895198:9	We had to , obviously , but the Poll Tax is now all on this modern technology and it does n't need nearly as many staff , and Phyllis will remember in her budget that they did put savings in the Treasurer 's Department for that very reason .
895211:43	But if we want to delivery good , high quality services , we have to employ the right number of people to do it , and Queenie is just , you know , talking well near nonsense .
895215:21	But as well as cost , you must always look at quality .
895217:7	You have to employ sufficient people to be able to deliver the service that people expect .
895223:100	erm if you 're asking about the twinning off erm compared with spending on recreation , or on erm environmental health or something , well yes , of course , we do have to make choices .
895226:51	I mean basically when we look at the range of council services , then you have to take decisions about the balance of spending between different priorities .
895308:29	Well , we 'll listen to what people have to say tomorrow on the phone in .
895311:38	Yes , we 've got to educate the public that crime must go down , and certainly we 've put in closed circuit televisions and tried to fence off wherever possible .
895315:142	I would state my own area ; we 've put residents ' parking into the south and the east and the west , but the north , as yet , has not come into it and erm traffic management is carefully monitored and erm developers that come have to provide certain amounts towards management within the area and there have been developments within North Oxford and there has been money available , and we 've not seen any of it yet , and we would , on certain occasions , like to know why .
895341:8	You must get the alternative there first , and we have n't got it at the moment .
895345:7	We have to tax those parking spaces , make them use the Park and Drive , but we 've got to get the carrot there first and the carrot is a much better operated Park and Drive .
895379:12	And also one must bear in mind we 've got to maintain the commercial life of the City .
895407:277	I think one is largely on judging people in the hands of the media , looking at it from an ordinary party member I think it 's the air he gives , whether it 's an air of confidence competence and perhaps and air of confidence , the way he handles himself in the House of Commons , the things that he actually says , because within that time you 're not able , in fact , to have achieved much erm parliamentary wise , one very much has to judge a person by what he has .
895419:10	You only have to look at his background .
895433:50	Well if we have another woman Prime Minister in the near future that woman would have to rise , in the Conservative Party at least , from a position outside the Cabinet , because there are no women in the cabinet .
895442:15	I think one has to be very careful here .
895488:137	When they rise to an equal level , like for instance if I have a choice between going to a woman doctor and a man doctor and they 're both on the GP list , I will choose the woman , because the woman has had to fight tooth and nail , probably , and work much harder , to get at an equal level with the man , so I would suspect that I 'm getting value for and quality there by going for the woman .
895494:37	Well , by taking into account things like she 's had to struggle and so on , and if her qualifications are actually as good then maybe she 's had to work harder .
895494:92	Well , by taking into account things like she 's had to struggle and so on , and if her qualifications are actually as good then maybe she 's had to work harder .
895598:149	In fact I sat next to her at a lunch in Abingdon a few years ago , and erm this image one got of her of not being a listener is totally untrue erm every time she turned to me it was to listen to what I had to say .
895626:44	This is one person who ca n't be quoted , but apparently this had to do with the description of John Major during that leadership crisis .
895651:42	I think he erm to be Prime Minister , you do have to have a strand of ruthlessness
895683:55	Well could I I mean this is of course one of the criticisms that one had to bear about Mrs. Thatcher about erm they say he 's not his own man , that to me indicates that he may be taking advice .
895692:21	about that rejoice , but you must admit there is a gung ho attitude of Mrs. Thatcher
895737:17	Mr Kinnock and erm Paddy Ashdown had to actually go into the Commons to
895751:79	I think that is actually something that I like about him , the fact that he left school early , that he did actually have to struggle .
895793:7	It has to do with the way you speak , the way you erm where you went to school , what connections you have , what values you hold .
895836:7	Something must I would hope that something will be done about those who erm want to
895844:15	erm he 'll have to eventually .
895862:98	I suspect that we will find that John Major is both pro-active and reaction , because in the next few months erm up to some time before June nineteen ninety two , there has to be a manifesto produced for the next election , and I think it 's in that you will probably see the pro-active side of John Major and his colleagues .
895876:32	Well , as John Major would say , you 'll have to wait and see if I may say so .
895888:11	Well you have to think , International Women 's Day has been going for just about a hundred years .
895913:10	Now there must be various tiers in that department , and various levels of well what floor do you work on ?
895916:33	And on the fourth floor the management work , and I have to say they are all men , that 's true .
895975:19	And I think that you have to look much more carefully at what I would want to call positive discrimination .
895982:42	erm but that specifically is one of the developments that is has had to be the cut with the budget that was made last month .
896005:52	Yes , I think is probably so and I think this is what we have got to do with girls .
896040:53	Well , as is with everything when you 're talking about changing things , women really have to get themselves organized , nobody 's going to give it to them .
896052:32	But who you see at the very beginning they must have established what the roles were .
896067:10	Maybe people have to look at alternatives and non-governmental ways to change things .
896074:17	I think that there must be a partnership of that kind in order to offer the opportunities that people , women particularly with children , are saying they need .
896078:109	We 're going to put the whole exhibition for the day there , so they can see the kinds of ways that women have got jobs and the kinds of training that they 've had to get to get them .
896111:18	But I mean I must admit on the side of some men , it 's not actually an individual thing that I totally blame it on , although men , you know , have their responsibilities .
896145:16	I mean I have to say for myself , I mean I was married .
896149:105	I think it is really because I think what we 've got to do , if we are going to have any sort of partnership or equality , I think men have got to become more like women .
896152:41	I mean why is n't there a tremendous outcry , saying this must change , we can still have democracy , but let 's have reasonable , sensible , working hours in parliament so that we can get more women into parliament .
896174:13	erm we have to continually fight , but to say we have to fight as well for our children and that is , in many ways , you know , the odds start off being stacked against us in my view erm and it is a continual battle .
896174:41	erm we have to continually fight , but to say we have to fight as well for our children and that is , in many ways , you know , the odds start off being stacked against us in my view erm and it is a continual battle .
896221:7	They have to keep fighting .
896252:58	So today it was lessons at home for some of the class provided by parents who 'd had to take time off work .
896258:15	I think she must be .
896260:15	But to me that has got to be the same thing .
896267:42	Is n't the education authority failing in its duty though , when it has to send children home ?
896307:7	We must expect there to be danger in every obscured section of road .
896324:24	At the age of seventy five she has to wade through a sea of mud to get to her council home at Cinderford in Gloucestershire .
896365:47	erm the roads are really not , not made to cope and so we have to try to get people coming in from different areas and different directions so that we do n't get everybody on one road and nobody on another .
896394:39	The Irish have been so busy praying for the winners that they must have forgotten to ask for the right weather .
896403:7	Cheltenham has to cater for everyone from burger to banquet .
896445:35	I think that the first thing that one would have to say is that we work for the Ministry of Defence , and not the Ministry of War and therefore we are about defence , we 're about the maintenance of peace , erm this you know maintaining of justice etc etc .
896468:38	I think forgiveness is extremely difficult and I think you have to have something done against you to be able to forgive .
896604:34	Also , it 's not just one market , essentially you have to treat it as fifty , fifty one markets .
896676:42	That 's what a rate reduction meant in real terms and that had to be weighed against the vicious cuts which were being posed in order to achieve it .
896690:28	It is erm on a highway and we have to be very sensitive to the erm not treating anybody whether erm it be a member of parliament or a councillor in anyway which would not to the authorities .
896699:18	They say they may have to stop working at the hospital and it ca n't survive without them .
896707:59	It would , for most G Ps , mean several more hours a week in the surgery and that time has to come from somewhere .
896708:13	In Stroud it has to come from hospital time .
896715:24	If the hospital closed , most would have to travel to Gloucester .
896887:18	erm yes , obviously it has to be an individual decision on people 's parts , how you know whether they feel they 're prepared to do that .
896911:11	erm I have to say that people are just as interested in having a proper explanation brought out and one that 's brought out from independent questioning of Thames 's explanations .
896948:66	No matter how much you speed up the entry into London at some point in time you are going to have to create a jam .
896977:36	Our offices had expanded very rapidly from 1986 onwards and we had to increase our production capacity here and we were finding it very difficult to recruit trained sewing machinists .
896987:37	Before we had we bought a house and so I really had to come back to work because we needed my wages and erm the creche was just being brought out so I knew there was a chance of coming back .
896990:54	If attitudes change and , with the need to attract people back to work , they may have to , then company creches could soon be as common as canteens .
897089:19	During the conflict , a Vulcan had to land in Brazil after running out of fuel .
897140:47	He neglected all his duties and so there was nothing for it , either we had to wipe him off as a son , which is an impossible thing for a parent to do , or we had to decide the only other course open to us which was to kidnap him and have him de-programmed .
897140:114	He neglected all his duties and so there was nothing for it , either we had to wipe him off as a son , which is an impossible thing for a parent to do , or we had to decide the only other course open to us which was to kidnap him and have him de-programmed .
897146:94	These cults are very adept at using the law for their own ends and parents , I 'm afraid , in their desire to rescue their youngsters from the cults , will have to cross a line .
897147:101	As you would imagine , if you saw your youngster tottering towards Beachy Head and was about to fall off , and if there was a notice there that said you must n't cross over this fence as you are guilty of trespassing , but you saw your child falling , what would you do - stay this side of the line because it was the law ?
897212:12	I really had to decide that I was going to , you know , it was really worth going .
897323:9	Does it have to be a man ?
897331:16	The prospective tenants do n't have to belong to any particular regiment or come from any particular part of the country .
897332:17	The only thing they have to do is find the rent .
897357:11	What we must do is see what the problems are from the owner 's point of view and analyse exactly what is going on .
897441:65	In the long run I think it will be a loss to the Government , for the very simple reason we have got to meet this competition and if we do n't in a few years time the housewife possibly will be paying a lot more money for the produce .
897445:26	The growers are unhappy they 'll soon have to travel a lot further than the Vale of Evesham to get help .
897465:7	I have to go up to the hospital twice a week to day assessment unit , where they are doing test on the baby just to monitor its progress and see if everything is going okay .
897477:25	She was so badly burned that surgeons had to amputate her left hand .
897579:7	It must be something of a surprise today the announcement ?
897593:12	So I 'll have to have a belated erm celebration .
897693:45	Because she 's such a happy child and she copes with all the thing she has to have done .
897696:7	She has to wear an artificial arm and mask to protect the skin on her face .
897735:52	In a statement this evening , Thames Water apologized for the inconvenience caused , but said they must always give the welfare of their customers the highest priority .
897873:7	Police had to abandon a car chase after a serious of blunders .
897896:19	Now then , you do n't have to admit your age , but hands up if you remember these lads :
898021:7	Youngsters have to prove they 're over 18 before they 're served .
898031:84	House of Commons leader , John Wakeham , who 's heading the committee that 's looking at the problem says it 's an issue which must be tackled locally .
898043:33	Judge Gabriel Hatton said anyone who assaulted the police must go to gaol .
898288:59	So the school 's package has been used widely used in Britain , but this time the designers had to switch to Russian to get their ideas across .
898312:32	The dead man , who has n't been named , had to be cut free from his car .
898375:33	Competition is fierce and this is where American marketing methods have to be used to help British products compete .
898399:39	Anaeas is in love with Dido but is told that he must leave in order to save trial .
898400:10	So he has to go back home and leave her and in telling her of course he breaks her heart .
898402:7	I have to stand there , like some sort of statute I think , and let everybody act around me .
898404:31	You can really get into the part if you have to play somebody upset .
898405:179	We leave the second part to the sorceress who 's the really strong character in the whole play to spoil this love match and she sends the spirit of herself in the form of the God Mercury to deceive Anaeas into saying he 's got to go away , so he goes and tells Dido he must leave and of course Dido 's heartbroken and she commits suicide and of course this is celebrated with the famous lament at the end of the opera .
898409:87	Three drivers will be burning their L-plates tonight after passing their driving tests first time , but , as John Kane , reports besides needing good road sense the men had to be pretty nifty with a shovel full of coal .
898521:30	As a company , as a port , well you must ask the Port Authority .
898563:71	They claim the building was 300 years old and should be restored , but Thamesdown Council decided the building was unsafe and had to go .
898620:20	He 's a good jumper and must have a very , very good chance .
898621:10	We 'll have to have a lot of luck in running .
898730:7	Police had to close some Gloucestershire roads and in some places depths of three feet were reported .
898733:7	Police had to close the A 38 at Broadegg , and in some parts the water was three foot deep .
898786:177	The actual state of the market is that it 's flooded with property , so we have a case where supply has increased , demand is still at a fairly low level , so we 're having to be very honest with our clients , our vendors , and let them know that the situation is that their property has to be of good value in the market place .
898791:39	And while the house market has ground to a halt , you 'll have to move quickly if you want to become a pub landlord .
898867:25	To have your independence took away completely must be absolutely terrible .
898878:33	Those are the little things and to a mother they must mean so much .
898885:36	This is the leading edge of medical technology and therefore it has to be done at the proper pace within the ethical considerations and I think the team 's decision to pause and look at evaluation is the right one .
898928:37	At 3:1 United were cruising again and the Manor Ground fans must have been thinking what could have been this season if there had been more games like this .
898965:32	It is , above all , something where you have to be utterly precise and there 's no warm up , you just go out there and do it and that 's very challenging .
898968:33	On the whole it is a matter that you have to learn the hills , you have to be very committed to the corners so that you get the thing right and as fast as possible , and you do n't have that much chance to learn .
898968:54	On the whole it is a matter that you have to learn the hills , you have to be very committed to the corners so that you get the thing right and as fast as possible , and you do n't have that much chance to learn .
899056:8	It must be grown early and erm , and then just erm down , plenty of muck up in the ground , and erm they 'll grow .
899120:34	It 's been difficult in = thing that you had to go home at night and keep watering like , your not doing anything else but watering , watering
899138:15	So again Warwickshire desperately had to win was slipping away , and with it their chances of the championship .
899144:27	But with the change of rules meaning Warwickshire have to let one of them go at the end of the season , which one will it be ?
899175:54	And finally tonight Moseley rugby club have come up with a very different approach to pre-season training , I have to tell you it is not what you 'd expect from the lads from the Readings .
899185:32	First you grow your flowers , and then you have to cut them and then display them , now I call that flower arranging , but here , they call it floral art , and you can understand why .
899298:16	: Fa A man had to be rescued from the top of Hereford Cathedral this afternoon after he had a heart attack .
899319:29	But it was open , I mean it must have been fenced in some way later on .
899340:38	He did n't actually live in St Aldate 's , but he must have been here a lot , because he was mayor in 1636 , he was an alderman erm he was very much a leading in the city , and I think the leader of the opposition to Royal Policies .
899341:72	erm And erm when he came back after the war , he actually was so much involved on the parliamentarian side he had to leave Oxford during the war , but when he came back he built a school in the city which was actually in the Guildhall courtyard , it was built round the courtyard , and that remained a free school , for the city 's boys right up to the end of the 19th century .
899350:18	erm The warden of Merton had to get out of Oxford quick when the king arrived , because , and spent the erm war in London , name was Nathaniel Brent , and he was quite an important man in the organisation of the Parliamentary war effort , and Lincoln had rather mixed loyalties , too .
899384:23	erm I think the city must have become a real mess , there were stores piled up everywhere , wood , coal , corn , often I think they had to build sort of , something to hold the corn , there 's a lot of the evidence for that in the college accounts certainly .
899384:90	erm I think the city must have become a real mess , there were stores piled up everywhere , wood , coal , corn , often I think they had to build sort of , something to hold the corn , there 's a lot of the evidence for that in the college accounts certainly .
899385:16	Military stores , every musketeer had to have at least two metres of match which was a fairly thick cord , which was used to ignite his musket , and if you start thinking about how many musketeers there were around in Oxford , a whole lot of match had to be stored .
899385:151	Military stores , every musketeer had to have at least two metres of match which was a fairly thick cord , which was used to ignite his musket , and if you start thinking about how many musketeers there were around in Oxford , a whole lot of match had to be stored .
899387:28	erm And there was , of course , powder had to be stored as well .
899389:207	That 's another story , where they were , and if you 're interested , downstairs there 's a very good map that shows you superimposed on a modern map of Oxford where they were , but they very much affected citizens in the St Aldate 's , because every citizen , and every scholar who was still in the university , between the ages of 16 and 60 had to work on the fortifications at least one day a week , or pay a shilling fine .
899397:42	There were these big loans for instance , $ 2,500 once the city had to make to the king .
899398:47	And this was collected by the parishes , and we know that St Aldate 's had to pay $ 280 , which along with All Saints , the city church , was the highest amount from all the various parishes .
899400:22	If they were freemen , they had to give up their right to graze in Port Meadow , because erm the hay was to be grown there , to be promised to His Majesty .
899401:8	They had to perhaps give up their pots and pans , or they were supposed to .
899405:32	But I think the main thing that they all had to bear to survive , was a tremendous amount of overcrowding. erm Now , we 're fast running out of time , are n't we .
899406:120	What I am going to talk about next is erm I 'll just mention that , about another 5 minutes , I think , will get us to the other great bit of work that poor old Edward Heath had to do in St Aldate 's , which again , that gives us a great deal about the insight as to what it was like there .
899417:80	Now , I think there 's probably a very nice parallel here , I ca n't help thinking it was probably a bit better , must have been better organised in the Second World War , but there 's going to be a erm special exhibition here is n't there , on memories of change on Oxford in the Second World War , and of course there were a great many extra people there too .
899419:241	erm I wo n't go through too many of them , erm but Blue Boar Inn , for instance , had 21 extra people , had some of the King 's servants , some of the prince 's servants , they had two Scottish peers , and their servants , $ 21 extra people , in a big inn , there were 14 rooms , I think , that were , could be called living rooms , but never-the-less , I think it must have been pretty crowded .
899420:53	$ But I think to give us perhaps a more vivid idea of what it must have been like for ordinary people , these are 3 houses in St Aldate 's that do n't exist any more , they 're down more-or-less where the police station is , erm and we do know exactly who lived there , and who was actually there during the war .
899433:80	So I think life was erm boring , tough , hard-working , pretty unpleasant during the war , erm and I think most of the citizens must have been very very relieved when the surrender finally came , and it brought no actual fighting , and at least the city was left reasonably unscathed .
899445:39	South Cambridgeshire District Council has recognized the important part that environmental health officers have to play within the work of the District Council , and for some time now the work of the Department has been carried on under the hat of the Legal , Housing and Health Director .
899449:51	I 'm very sorry that as soon as I have finished this welcome this morning that I have got to leave you , and I am very sorry that I shall not be able to return this evening for your dinner which I would originally look forward very much to but I trust that you will enjoy the company of the Chairman of our Environmental Services Committee , Councillor Robin Draga , who is attending on my behalf .
899459:14	And so finally I must say to you once again , welcome to South Cambridgeshire , and I hope that this will be a very pleasant and a very informative symposium .
899565:10	So you must n't be bruised and disappointed because your impeccable piece is turned down .
899571:105	They 're talking about your lot today , tomorrow it 's going to be about cricket , the day after it 's going to be about something else , it 's and they have to pick up things very quickly .
899615:22	One of the things you have to remember is that you do actually know quite a lot about how the media operate already .
899691:52	Do n't forget that if you are going to quote other people at length , you have to check on whether you 're going to be in breach of copyright , you have to be careful how to quote things , and do n't forget that if you are actually quoting you need to give some indication of where the quotation comes from and make and check out that that 's all right , either by getting permission or , or actually giving , there 's a certain degree of flexibility .
899691:105	Do n't forget that if you are going to quote other people at length , you have to check on whether you 're going to be in breach of copyright , you have to be careful how to quote things , and do n't forget that if you are actually quoting you need to give some indication of where the quotation comes from and make and check out that that 's all right , either by getting permission or , or actually giving , there 's a certain degree of flexibility .
899692:66	You 're allowed relatively small quotations of other people without being accused of plagiarism and breach of copyright , but you have to do it advisedly , so make sure you know the rules if you actually do this .
899735:239	I think in the current atmosphere of local government reform , I mean maybe there is an answer there , I mean you work for local councils but much of your role is concerned with statutory instruments if you like , statutory issues , issues which have got absolutely nothing to do with the people who are supposedly making the decisions which you 're supposed to implement , they 're made nationally , and you have to implement them .
899751:31	But then you also , as I see it , have to play the conciliators , between between neighbours in disputes about noise or whatever , bonfires , things like that .
899771:15	I think you must strike a very fine balance .
899772:10	But you must be , or you must become , very much your own men and women because newspapers everywhere and all the other parts of the media are only , are just sitting there with baited breath aching for that phone to ring from you , to tell us things , because virtually anything which you get involved in , is likely in one way or another to be controversial .
899772:24	But you must be , or you must become , very much your own men and women because newspapers everywhere and all the other parts of the media are only , are just sitting there with baited breath aching for that phone to ring from you , to tell us things , because virtually anything which you get involved in , is likely in one way or another to be controversial .
899795:24	This is the scenario , and they had to go away and ask , write a press release in that scenario .
899833:26	So , Bob , what do you have to say about that one ?
899842:18	I mean certainly I have to say I think most journalists would n't even have noticed that
899878:7	You must have meant something about this
899903:140	So , so make a clear , definitive statement of what it is , so that the rumour does n't leak over , and you find yourself answering rumours , you 're actually answering problems about facts which you can substantiate rather than rumours which you have to deny and then substantiate the facts .
899945:204	The other , the other weakness it possibly turned up is that , my experience is that , unless something bad there , the press do n't really want to do anything about it , if you 're just trying to sell your wares and say how good you are , and then hide a bit behind , I mean they 'll turn around anyway the circle , must be something .
899966:91	Yes , but the pro-active , the good news often is not a good enough hook , I mean in my experience , the local media , they do want , the hook has to be , at least in the , in the initial phase has to be bad news .
899966:126	Yes , but the pro-active , the good news often is not a good enough hook , I mean in my experience , the local media , they do want , the hook has to be , at least in the , in the initial phase has to be bad news .
899968:7	You have to work harder to get a good news hook , but it , but it , it still exists and people still are interested , provided it 's a hook .
900026:7	You have to be very sure about that
900029:8	We must have a decent , we must have decent local men .
900029:24	We must have a decent , we must have decent local men .
900050:23	I mean that is I have to say that that is the kind of press release which frequently comes across both Brian 's desk and mine all too frequently .
900063:130	There are some things which are just sort of have a fairly short lifetime , both in terms of the interest of the event and also the , also the interest of the press in it in which case you just have to use your judgement .
900117:9	And I have to say that it was after we had done a course for them on really bad press releases , because we , they had done some pretty awful press releases in the past , and we were delighted when that one came out because it actually showed that they 'd picked up the message .
900158:12	So , you have to think about who you 're aiming it at .
900166:7	You have to be quite clear in your own mind who you are aiming this at and how you are actually going to formulate it .
900299:78	You have national radio , of course , but in a sense there 's less of it , in terms of hour times , and you have to be that much better to get on it , and the opportunities are not nearly as flagrant as on local radio .
900345:9	And you must discover ways in which you can link this to ordinary people 's concerns .
900361:7	You have to know who your audience is .
900428:15	You feel you had to explain that , do you ?
900464:83	More or less , yes , except that , because the human ear responds to different frequencies , or pictures of sound , with different sensitivities , the sound meter has to be adapted so it responds in the same way .
900637:61	But those , those Environmental Health Officers who go into committee , and we know very well that you have to put your argument in a particular way or put your point a particular way , in which you want to convince people .
900653:18	I 'm sure there must be things that your institution would like your council to be doing but which your council is n't doing .
900719:89	It 's explaining that this is what the recommendation is , however , I 'm not a dictator , I 'm put there by you voters , your representatives have got to decide .
900842:140	Turner did the grand tour , certainly ; he learnt a lot in Italy , but he learnt equally a great deal from English artists and from Dutch artists and in so far as he used the grand tour , and used what Rome and other countries had to offer , that 's what every artist did , every European artist , not just the English .
900863:27	It seems to me that ultimately artists must be successful or otherwise because of the public response to their output .
900878:25	I do n't mean that people necessarily have to like what 's going on .
900912:99	The thing about art is that it is n't just a nostalgic wallowing in things of the past that are comfortable , but art as an adventure , and one just has to go along with it .
900919:101	The talks to end the ambulance dispute continue in London , and the crisis at Banbury 's Horton General Hospital ; the unit manager says there 's just no more cash , so operations have to be cancelled .
900932:112	As the Right Honourable Gentleman is aware , our top priority is to get inflation down , and I would also hope that he would be aware that the aim of doing that in the longer term has to be by making the price of money more expensive .
900942:15	Shell U K will have to wait until tomorrow to hear what sentence it receives for causing a 30 mile oil slick which polluted the River Mersey .
900963:15	Last August the hospital had to close 26 beds because it could n't afford to staff them .
900965:20	We 're very sorry to have to curtail our services er in this way .
900966:163	We 're having with effect from next Monday to reduce er our service to urgent cases only : accidents , emergency cases , those that need urgent medical care , they will be dealt with , but patients who are awaiting this type cases , for orthopaedics , gynaecology , general surgery er will have to be postponed for a period of about 5 weeks .
900975:41	I think if we get the same budget next year , we will have to consider very carefully what work load we undertake in the next financial year , yes .
901015:150	I 'm not sure whether that 's true , I mean I think the argument er in this particular case is about the amount of money which a particular area of the Department of Social Security can operate , and presumably looking at this , Nichola Scott will have to er match up if you like the total quantity and make sure it 's effectively allocated .
901065:19	Because of that the reactors had to undergo a licensing procedure from Nuclear , Now that survey , which they have been carrying out for a number of months now , almost certainly would require that a number of major improvements be made to those reactors , and they just have n't got the money to do that at the moment .
901078:161	I myself would seemingly represent the environmental lobby , but there have been others , many ex-members of Harwell , who have been campaigning for a long time now , many years , to get these reactors shut down , and it has just been a very long slog , and eventually the truth has had to come to light to shut these reactors down .
901091:8	We have got to depend on state hand-outs to live , and I think that 's shocking to say the least .
901138:15	Last August the hospital had to close 26 beds because it could n't afford to staff them .
901139:19	And Shell U K will have to wait until tomorrow to hear what sentence it receives for causing a 30 mile oil slick , which polluted the River Mersey .
901154:59	This would suggest that Business Studies , along with other subjects such as perhaps Sociology and History , perhaps have to be re-evaluated , compared to other subjects such as Maths and Physics and Chemistry .
901156:12	Well , it must be remembered that the Business Studies that I 'm talking about is A E B , which is Associated Examining Board .
901176:11	If you had to give your husband or family food that was irradiated , you 'd be concerned .
901255:14	Now that report usually had to be filed 48 hours after he went down .
901303:37	er I practised it er twice already , and I er have to do it in front of the jury .
901359:64	Ian Philpot , whose girlfriend was one of the 51 people who died , says Transport Secretary Cecil Parkinson must now call a public enquiry .
901369:10	I will have to do what I can now to pick up the threads of my life .
901413:20	Mrs Thatcher said there 'd have to be a long-term transition .
901426:11	They really must realise that time and time again being equivocal on defence when you 're on the left of centre means that voters somehow do n't vote for you , and I think they 've had to learn this lesson yet again and I only hope that by the er December elections in West Germany the Social Democratic Party who I 've got a great deal of er sympathy for on most social issues will be firm and clear about a united Germany not being neutral and within NATO .
901426:117	They really must realise that time and time again being equivocal on defence when you 're on the left of centre means that voters somehow do n't vote for you , and I think they 've had to learn this lesson yet again and I only hope that by the er December elections in West Germany the Social Democratic Party who I 've got a great deal of er sympathy for on most social issues will be firm and clear about a united Germany not being neutral and within NATO .
901577:146	And other costs , such as readers and having to buy books because you ca n't borrow them for long enough from libraries to get them recorded or brailled , er those sorts of things really are n't taken account of and you 're simply going to have to borrow money er to pay for your disability in effect .
901588:33	Nevertheless it is still a loan that of course has to be repaid .
901590:92	Yes , I think there is a fair point there but er I do n't know whether you listeners appreciate that nobody at all , whether disabled or not will have to repay the student loan after they 've graduated if their income is below 85 % of the national average wage , which is currently 11,500 pounds , er we are recognising that they do face some additional costs er when they 've graduated and that should be taken into account and that will be one of the things in our concession .
901677:228	The basis of the book is that we are unfulfilled because we 've grown too sophisticated for God , we 're lonely , we 're morally confused , and I think God is the answer for this , it fashions , religion fashions the kind of community in which you 're redeemed from loneliness , it gives you the sense that when you come close to the end of your life you do n't have to panic that you have wasted your life because religion can show you that you have made a difference to the world .
901689:9	Did you have to go , did you have to go and meet the Chairman of British Rail ?
901689:29	Did you have to go , did you have to go and meet the Chairman of British Rail ?
901696:9	So you have to watch it at home ?
901711:47	I do n't know whether he 'll win the award again , we shall have to wait and find out until May .
901765:82	Yes , it 's always sad to say farewell to colleagues that have been with you for a number of years , but all things have to come to an end , we say farewell with sadness and er fond memories to those who 've been with us for so long , but we welcome all those who are joining us and we can promise them a thriving future .
901794:131	I was very pleased er when I came to put the book together to find that er most of er most of the actual walks corresponded with what was on the paper , which was nice , so I did n't have to waste much time .
901814:7	It must be quite an interesting thing to rehearse because you 're rehearsing a play about the back-stage life of another play , it 's almost like a mirror and a mirror and a mirror
901831:50	I mean , now I 've got several hundred pounds resting on it if I have to walk in the last few miles I will , but er pride I 'm sure I 'll keep going .
901955:101	Still to come a look at the opening shots in the Independent Enquiry into the fate of Rover 's Cowley works and the questions that Bicester 's friends of the earth say you must ask any candidate in the local elections .
902013:42	They could have easily made that to us the local planners who have to determine what kind of jobs go where and we could have discussed it with them .
902017:173	In the paper prepared by the Trade Union Research Project which the Panel considered , they outline 5 options , one is a new model , two is a switch to high technology industry and the Panel will come up and say well they either support one or two or three of these options and then the council will have to consider which of the options they adopt , and then have to consider what their planning powers are in relation to it .

902018:11	But it must become clear , I 'll make this point clearly to the taxpayers and the people who live in this city , it must become clear , at some point this company must talk to this planning authority .
902018:77	But it must become clear , I 'll make this point clearly to the taxpayers and the people who live in this city , it must become clear , at some point this company must talk to this planning authority .
902018:104	But it must become clear , I 'll make this point clearly to the taxpayers and the people who live in this city , it must become clear , at some point this company must talk to this planning authority .
902063:44	Well no , voting is when somebody goes to the polling booth they have to weigh all the pro 's and cons of all the information that they 've been told .
902065:68	I would think all political parties realise the value of greenness , er have you been canvassed yet , have you had to try out any of these questions ?
902072:9	They have to for some journeys yes , but there are a lot of alternatives and I think if the councillors were actually to rely more on public transport they maybe would feel more comfortable about putting subsidies into buses instead of subsidies into car parks .
902241:44	These revelations come from talking to Personnel managers who admitted they often have to force over-stressed employees to have time off .
902369:99	Seventeen year old Ritu Vasudeva spoke of how her family sheltered in their house for a month for fear of being taken to one of Saddam 's guest hotels , then they had to forge exit papers to enable them to escape .
902372:9	Did you have to hide in your flat in Kuwait ?
902378:38	And Virgin 's boss says there 's a great deal that has to be done to stop more deaths in the crisis zone .
902439:75	It is therefore time now that the policy about this be reassessed and that the government acknowledges that this threat now exists and must be addressed .
902465:150	We are concerned in fact that er the western nations did n't rather deplore earlier er Hussein 's actions against his own people using chemical weapons , and we think it 's a shame for us that we 've only come in at this point , and we must come in carefully I think .
902469:54	Then secondly this should be supported by the United Nations who , if this fails , may have to intervene then .
902480:9	But we have to say that the er the individual risks to patients from the radiation used in examinations are very very low .
902484:22	But you are saying that hospitals must pay more attention to the justification of , for performing an X-ray ?
902553:42	All the time when there is an H I V antibody test it must be with informed consent from the patient or staff member .
902587:31	Well I think the first thing is , we have to bring out into the open the way in which the law is being misused .
902589:12	And we really have to in the first instance , get public opinion to realise the way in which our lives are so pervasively subject to criminal prosecution , that 's the first step .
902707:176	Criminals are n't too bothered about the er problems they cause victims in the commission for their crime , but er as a general rule er they do draw a line somewhere , but I think to er rob a lady who is er presumably grieving over the loss of a relative , at the graveside , has got to be plumbing some new depth of er depravity and er I 'll expect the erm vast majority of the citizens of Banbury will think similarly .
902733:47	Well I 'm sorry that the gentleman from Athens said that , but we have to understand that people right now are going through some very strong feelings and I 'm sure they 're disappointed .
902764:149	So that we really do hope that when the news comes through today , it 's going to be positive and the international community , if I can put it this strongly , will have come to it 's senses and said this cannot go on , we must have a more representative political presence at the U N .
902775:53	It 's a very important distinction and one that is n't properly understood : the police have to have clear concrete evidence on an offence .
902776:32	What the High Court or what the local authority have to consider is how do we protect the welfare of those children ?
902791:36	And therefore the new virus can grow and the immune system again has to learn to suppress this virus .
902795:16	I think we have to learn a lot er of , of how to treat the AIDS virus , but er hopefully , er the scientists might succeed to find the vaccine .
902808:92	Yes , we would be dependent on the referring doctor 's interpretation of the X-ray films , and they would relate that to us on the telephone and we would then have to form a , a mental image of what the problem was and then advise on how we thought things ought to go on .
902842:116	There are still many areas in Great Britain where there are test centres who are an awful long way from the motorway , and at the moment , Banbury is in that position , so the driving test would have to be at least something like 2 or 3 hours duration by the time they got out there and driven .
902869:81	Most of that will go on delivering the programmes er and most of that is existing funding and so we 're going to have to use a lot of it on that , but we want to do new things as well .
902913:11	The fundamental requirement must in the end of any prestigious academic institution , to be a place where academic standards are maintained .
902961:15	He says rates must be cut if Britain 's to avoid a slump and become competitive in Europe .
902967:126	The battle between the Prime Minister , the split indeed between the Prime Minister and the Chancellor which is a re-run of the appalling split between her and Nigel Lawson which is the origins of our present problem , is something that must be brought under control .
902968:35	It 's a time when the Chancellor of the Exchequer must put Britain first and the Prime Minister 's private prejudices and the good of the Tory party second .
902990:77	How do you , how do you feel about the future now , I mean we 've heard various people say interest rates must come down - you just said interest rates must come down , but when do you realistically think they could come down ?
903065:73	Clearly the riots and the er secrecy that the Home Office tried to surround those riots with , er show that we do have to have an ombudsman .
903083:21	Well we know that it must have happened overnight , er we were open until six o' clock on Thursday evening .
903084:29	Everything was checked and locked up and it must have gone during the late night or early morning , Thursday night/Friday morning .
903086:15	I think they must have known what they were coming for and this I 'm afraid , is one of the penalties of being open to the public .
903089:43	We have no choice ; when my father died in nineteen seventy-nine I had to come to an arrangement with the Capital Taxes Office , that , er for not paying the full value of the er death duties on the value of the contents of the house , I had to open it to the public , quite frankly , if then and even more now , if I had to pay the full amount , I 'd have had to sell everything which my family have collected over the last seven hundred years .
903089:153	We have no choice ; when my father died in nineteen seventy-nine I had to come to an arrangement with the Capital Taxes Office , that , er for not paying the full value of the er death duties on the value of the contents of the house , I had to open it to the public , quite frankly , if then and even more now , if I had to pay the full amount , I 'd have had to sell everything which my family have collected over the last seven hundred years .

903124:10	It 'll have to be enforced though .
903149:75	Sylvia Pedder from Headington in Oxford uses a wheelchair and despite efforts by British Rail to update their trains , she says often she has to travel for hours on end on her own .
903151:12	Sylvia Pedder sometimes has to go as far as Cumbria to see her relatives .
903156:97	British Rail chairman Sir Bob Reid has written expressing his sympathy , but B R 's Brian Johnson said it 'll be a while before he can guarantee Sylvia Pedder wo n't have to travel in the guard 's van .
903161:124	Well I feel that Sylvia should have the right as anyone else , as any other able person to travel in the right manner , as a passenger in the buffet car or , or or anywhere else on the train and not have to be , have to go in the guard 's van .
903161:136	Well I feel that Sylvia should have the right as anyone else , as any other able person to travel in the right manner , as a passenger in the buffet car or , or or anywhere else on the train and not have to be , have to go in the guard 's van .
903169:133	They would be perhaps regarded as thick as two short planks , er they would not be happy , they would be struggling to do work that was not honestly within their capacities , that being the case , they would almost certainly have to go down from the University .
903173:13	But the fundamental requirement must in the end , of any prestigious academic institution , to be a place where academic standards are maintained .
903189:27	You 've started today , it , it must be rather frightening , rather different .
903218:127	But one thing I can tell you about Port Vale , the ground has vastly changed from last season , the terracing 's been improved , their seating , it 's pure luxury apart from the press box , because I still have to climb that suspect wooden ladder , and perched on top of the main stand is a shed where I 'm speaking to you from Jane .
903258:60	Well what 's wrong in them doing er Ninja Turtle apples or Ninja Turtle wholemeal bread , why does it have to be pizzas and floury carbohydrate rubbish ?
903289:69	Now originally the trip was going to take them through many middle eastern countries including Jordan and Israel , er have you had to change your plans at all Andrew , it sounds as though that might not be the ideal place to be going at the moment ?
903298:21	Have you , have you both had to do any specific training or anything to , to get you this far ?
903310:13	You 'll still have to do a few miles ?
903327:33	Chris Patten says he 's launching a discussion we must all be part of .
903331:19	Mr Patten says the government must move at a pace it can afford .
903344:27	All of us , including the critics , have got to sit down and read three hundred pages line by line , to make final judgments , but we 're looking at a programme there of the next decade .
903350:59	er I think a couple of things : first of all , the detail programme ; the government will have to produce for the forthcoming World Climate Conference in October/November , er the way in which they 're going to reach their target and secondly that will also discuss from amongst all the countries , what the target should be .
903380:80	Still to come : the oil price tops the forty dollars a barrel mark and a support centre is set up for women who 've had to leave their husbands hostages in Kuwait .
903397:29	Of course , er we er , the provisos must be er that the er , that the prices or the costs at the Nuffield remain as competitive as they are at the moment , and of course , that we get the same very high quality that we er , that we already have .
903416:44	That 's true , er the market , and I think , the general public must be aware that so far , the supply is kept at a reasonable level , the erm difficulty coming out of the erm interruption of Iraqi and Kuwaiti field has been replaced .
903504:150	The situation that , that a lot of people find themselves in nowadays , now er council housing is no longer available to an awful lot of people , is that they 're at the mercy of private landlords , and in order to have any kind of home they have to go along this sort of conditions and rent levels laid down by private landlords .
903530:84	It went some way to repairing their damaged pride after their defeat by Swindon Town at the weekend , Mickey Inotta was there ; Mickey it must have cheered you up a bit .
903532:34	In the second division in this day and age , I had to climb a wooden ladder , I had to go all the way to the very top of the main stand and there was a shed , and at the end of the match , surface water forced me to dry my socks off in the radiator in the dressing rooms afterwards .
903532:59	In the second division in this day and age , I had to climb a wooden ladder , I had to go all the way to the very top of the main stand and there was a shed , and at the end of the match , surface water forced me to dry my socks off in the radiator in the dressing rooms afterwards .
903534:34	But then again , I 've always believed that the players have to show that character out there on the pitch , they have n't , they learnt their lesson , losing four two against Swindon , that match will never be forgotten by the supporters , it does n't matter if they win the Cup , it 'll never be forgotten .
903559:41	Right , well I suppose the big sporting story of the evening has to be the boxing ; George Forman , who 's forty-one is about to go into the ring in er London 's Docklands arena .
903624:51	Oh no , the er , to , to maintain authenticity , the people in the band have to look as if they would looked in nineteen forty , which is why er Sally Edwards who 's the Vera Lynn look-alike er would be more authentic than Vera Lynn herself .
903633:31	er It was just to show what people had to put up with .
903664:20	President Bush says the world must look beyond the Gulf crisis to a new deal for the Middle East , and he 's hinting that an Iraqi pull out from Kuwait could lead to an end to the conflict between the Arabs and Israel .
903665:42	But Mr Bush told the U N Security Council in New York that Iraq must put the right wrong it has done in seizing a nation to which it had no right .
903680:65	The families of two teenage joyriders shot dead by troops in Belfast are demanding to know why the checkpoint patrol had to kill them .
903684:31	The families of the two dead teenagers say there must have been an alternative to opening fire .
903687:36	Ulster 's Security Minister , John Cope says the teenagers only had to stop .
903725:42	It will obviously take some time , you know Alex is , must be going through a terrible strain himself and he must be concerned about us er as we are for him .
903725:71	It will obviously take some time , you know Alex is , must be going through a terrible strain himself and he must be concerned about us er as we are for him .
903727:86	Well , I think for the children 's sake , I 'm going to stay put until Christmas , but after that I 'm really going to have to try and find some sort of stability for my children .
903729:58	I 've gone to the local Council and er unfortunately they 've said to me that I 'd have to go on a waiting list ; the housing aid have said the only thing they could offer me is bed and breakfast which I 'm sorry to say I do n't think is suitable to bring two children up in .
903754:28	An Oxfordshire consultant has told how specialist hospitals have to turn to charity for funds because the government does n't provide enough money .
903757:73	Special care baby units are phenomenally expensive in equipment ; there 's an awful lot of monitoring equipment that 's required , and it has to be updated every few years , and the costs are quite out of proportion to the amount of money available to the health authority , so that er , on the whole , special care baby units throughout the country now rely virtually totally on charitable giving .
903758:25	A sports centre in north Oxfordshire has had to close today because of a leakage of almost one thousand litres of potentially hazardous chemicals .
903808:122	I think there 's been a lot , a lot of publicity for childline , now , but you are n't directly in , associated with childline Fjn Well , we 've had , no , we 've had to call ourselves children 's line because for er obvious reasons we ca n't call ourselves childline , but it is the same type of thing , er run in a similar way , not exactly the same of course er partly because we have n't got the money that childline er attracts .
903810:16	I mean it must cost a fair amount of money to keep it going cause , the calls are free
903812:19	Does that mean that you have to pay for them ?
903834:117	The world summit for children which took place at the weekend caught the headlines around the world and the world 's leaders put their heads together and agreed that children all round the world are suffering and something must be done about it .
903844:60	And that is a terrible terrible thing that we 've all got to face , but I think we have to realize that we have the potential , we have the ability of saving the lives of fifty million children , and the world 's leaders at the conference , at the summit over the weekend , actually turned their minds for an instant , away from all those economic and political problems and focused on this , and I think that that was tremendously important .
903846:29	I think here in the United Kingdom , we have to continue trying to urge our governments to ratify the Convention on the Rights of the Child , which is a sort of Bill of Rights for children .
903863:17	He says the world must examine the future for the Middle East when the Gulf crisis is over .
903873:36	We have a situation where the landowner is going to have to sell land relatively cheaply , in order that the land then , the land prices do not reflect too horrendously when it comes through to the price that has to be paid by the person who 's going to occupy the property ; either in terms of a letting figure or of something which is going to be an , effectively a mortgage figure .

903877:91	So that we 're prepared within the Rural Housing Trust to look at all these ideas , and we 've been looking at the whole question , we feel that this has got to be one for the planners , the planners must be involved in identifying where these problems lie , they 're not uniform , all across the country , er and it 's something that er we therefore need to use the planning er scenario entirely and fully in order to identify where the problem lies .

903881:48	That way , I think that some land might become available , but it would have to be up to the planners to be more flexible .
903883:21	Well I think we 'll have to re-look at the whole question of village envelopes in certain cases , where it is decided that low cost housing is desirable , and see if in some way , they can encourage the farmer to make land available so that he can make some money which he badly needs at the moment , as agriculture 's going through one of the biggest depressions it 's been through for years .
903912:26	I was going to say , you must have a lot of , er a lot of produce , er where does it go , what do you
903939:43	It was to me Jane , I was still in bed , we had to send Robin Powell down there to get the interviews .
903956:8	You have to be very clever to win races these days , and I 'm totally convinced and so is everybody else here that Nigel will win enough races providing his car is quick enough and reliable enough to win a world championship .
904108:21	And something like two million people have got to stop doing jobs they should never have been doing in the first place , like er polluting the rivers and the soil and the air , and spying on each other and contributing to the overmanning that there is in East Germany .
904109:9	And they have to move to other industries , er productive industries and service industries and er communications for example which is very run down , and that 's going to take I should think , six to nine months of really hard work and suffering , and and a political clean up at the same time , because in the schools and universities for instance , er nobody could get a job in the old days , who was n't politically reliable , and all those people have got to be moved .
904109:253	And they have to move to other industries , er productive industries and service industries and er communications for example which is very run down , and that 's going to take I should think , six to nine months of really hard work and suffering , and and a political clean up at the same time , because in the schools and universities for instance , er nobody could get a job in the old days , who was n't politically reliable , and all those people have got to be moved .
904143:65	Although Thames Water say they have n't yet prosecuted over previous bans , water resources manager Dave Cook says they may have to clamp down further .
904144:41	At the end of it there 's the chance that we may have to take action ; we 'd take that very much as a last resort , and we hope our customers will respond without the necessity for fines or prosecutions .
904174:69	Now , now that we are , are there I think we will stay there , and rightly , and I must say that er we have and I have a lot of confidence in the way the Americans have handled this so far , I think President Bush has done very well .
904191:46	er They 've lost most of their goods , er they 've had to leave enormous amounts of , of , of their personal belongings in , in Kuwait , they 're , they 're not physically in bad shape , but mentally they 're , they 're very anxious and , and they know they 've lost a lot of belongings .
904254:91	The extent of the problems faced by students at the poly was highlighted last week when it was revealed that some students were living in cars , and others had to turn down places because of the lack of affordable housing .
904359:20	Of course , Britain 's bosses have to be setting an example and obviously leadership has to emanate from the top , and is very often done by example .
904359:47	Of course , Britain 's bosses have to be setting an example and obviously leadership has to emanate from the top , and is very often done by example .
904402:10	You just have to feel sorry for him .
904424:144	Well , I think if you see a good idea , you want to share it , and I think anything that we can do that will cut down on the terrible casualties and the deaths on our roads of , particularly of children , we must do it .
904432:31	The minister revealed that from next April all learner drivers must be able to reverse into a parking place double the length of their own vehicle .
904461:33	Yes it is difficult , I mean , one has to , er we 've had a dialect coach and I 'm working very hard on the accent .
904498:33	And it , it does sound , I , I must say we 've , we 've having flowers everywhere and I think the whole evening 's going to be very nice and we 're looking forward to everybody enjoying themselves and having a good time .
904524:10	We 'll have to see what develops .
904559:7	You must still be taking that very seriously ?
904567:53	Former convict John McVicar whose own prison career was turned into a film says the Home Secretary must share the blame for the murder of any inmates in Strangeways .
904584:39	The land-based multi-warhead er missiles is a real issue that has to be tackled , er and they may either go for , this is very much up in the air , go for er distinct cuts in er Start one , or they may talk about limitations and then go for a Start two treaty .
904622:22	In England and Wales they 'll have to pay up to double the Poll Tax on any empty farm cottages they own , although farmers in Scotland are going to be exempt from this .
904643:88	They can , as you know , charge anything between nought and two hundred percent of the standard rate , and I feel it 's something that has to be sorted out locally .
904645:15	I think we have to exercise pressure locally to make sure our own Councils er answer .
904650:7	We have to face the problems when they actually come upon us .
904707:140	The isolation of Germany , by itself , in the middle of Europe , has led to two world wars , I think that now we have the opportunity to bind Germany in , a united Germany within the European Community , and within trans-Atlantic institutions , we must take our opportunities .
904710:7	I must admit I was struck by the way in which the debate was discussed .
904732:70	This is because the real economy has improved , but of course , it wo n't be true , er and we shall have to pay the price again er at the end of the , of the honeymoon period .
904801:45	And so now , we have one precise target , and the other two will have to slip by the board .
904805:8	I have to say though that with the terms on which we 've gone into the European Monetary System , a six per cent fluctuation either way , which as I said means from two seventy seven deutschmarks up to three thirteen ; there 's quite a lot of risk there for an exporter if he prices himself in deutschmarks and he gets it wrong .
904815:155	And I 'm quite sure that what Mr Major will then say if , if er demand and borrowing and so on does take off again , er is that this is because the real economy has improved , but of course it wo n't be true , er and we shall have to pay the price again er at the end of the , of the honeymoon period .
904830:36	The firm was fined one thousand , eight hundred pounds , and had to pay a hundred and ninety pounds costs as well as being invoiced for the N R A 's investigation costs .
904837:53	But actually to press for an out of court settlement which will mean we have to stop other services or stop er building schemes , seems to me wrong whilst we are being advised that we have a strong defence .
904846:15	One thing we must stipulate ; it is n't a get rich quick course , it 's giving you the background of it so that you can go away with as much information as possible .
904866:15	How many have you had to reject from that number ?
904872:7	We have to rely simply on the speculation that we hear .
904878:20	Oh indeed , but er you have to consider the situation the diplomatic situation between Britain , er the West in general and Iran which is the backer of Hezbalar which does pull the strings of the kidnappers , is perhaps er diff , different and in a more improved state than it ever has been before .
904886:37	If they want to settle out of court , then it has got to be a really substantial settlement to satisfy these people because er those that have already died , er they entered into the litigation in the hope of seeing it through and making sure that , er if anything did happen to them , their wives and families would be catered for and would be er financially settled .
904887:123	But the way things are at the moment , er you know , these people , the next of kin and dependents of those that have already died , until they get money through , they 're going to have to go cap in hand to the government to get whatever handout they can .
904894:15	I think we have to look at the climate we 're in ; we 're , at the moment the AIDS epidemic is facing all of us , it 's a problem for each and any , every one of us .
904896:49	I think when you 're dealing with something that is transmitted sexually you have to be very very clear about how it 's transmitted , I think you , you ca n't be vague about these sexual terms , you have , for , for medical reasons there 's nothing else ; you have to be exactly er clear about what you mean , by , by the activities you 're describing .
904896:168	I think when you 're dealing with something that is transmitted sexually you have to be very very clear about how it 's transmitted , I think you , you ca n't be vague about these sexual terms , you have , for , for medical reasons there 's nothing else ; you have to be exactly er clear about what you mean , by , by the activities you 're describing .
904899:153	I do n't think it 's condoning , I just think it 's given the safe , giving out the safest options for people who maybe taking drugs and , and and maybe in , in maybe er sometimes thinking about injecting drugs , and er I think we actually have to be very clear on this epidemic , that , that there is no , no way for , for lack of clarity , we have to go down the line .
904899:230	I do n't think it 's condoning , I just think it 's given the safe , giving out the safest options for people who maybe taking drugs and , and and maybe in , in maybe er sometimes thinking about injecting drugs , and er I think we actually have to be very clear on this epidemic , that , that there is no , no way for , for lack of clarity , we have to go down the line .
904940:62	Older people we know want to be offered more ways of preventing illness , so you know , they have to really be informed , er we want them to know about it so then they can make the choice as to whether they take it up with their G P .
904962:45	The Authority meets on Friday to reconsider its building programme which will now have to be slowed down , owing to the collapse of the property market .
904970:48	Do you resent having been put into the position where you had rely , had to rely on land sales ?
904971:40	No , I think it 's er fair that the government er must make the most of its assets .
905002:60	It wo n't work when you go one nil up , or you 're one nil down , you have to hold something in reserve ; mid-field players have to come back , the forwards have to come back and hold tight , you do n't just go charging up looking to get another goal , or trying to equalize , but that 's the basic error .
905002:90	It wo n't work when you go one nil up , or you 're one nil down , you have to hold something in reserve ; mid-field players have to come back , the forwards have to come back and hold tight , you do n't just go charging up looking to get another goal , or trying to equalize , but that 's the basic error .

905019:30	I do n't know much about snooker , I must be honest , the last time I played , I kissed off the pink and owed Stewart Cameron a fiver , and that 's basically all I know about it .
905052:11	They 've had to do it during the weekend , a distance of eighty five miles , and it goes across five counties .
905077:28	er The first day we reckon we 'll have to cycle about er eleven hours , and the second day , slightly less time - ten hours probably , so it 's about twenty one hours cycling .
905130:48	I 'd like to know more details of the circumstances of it , but one must always mourn the deaths of people whether they are innocent civilians , members of the security forces or paramilitaries , because it 's an indication that there 's a failure of the system in Northern Ireland .
905179:43	They claim the City has less than half the resources it should have to deal with the growing number of such homes , H M O 's for short .
905197:46	Helen Atkins , the Council 's solicitor dealing with the issue , says the Authority has to act on the complaints it received over the summer , but admits there 's still a long way to go .
905198:32	Really the Council is in a position where it must act upon complaint , and it must look at the complaints and comments that 's been received .
905198:52	Really the Council is in a position where it must act upon complaint , and it must look at the complaints and comments that 's been received .
905199:109	The actual bye-law itself is very much in its infancy , the situation is that , if , if the Council agree , if members of Council agree to make the bye-law , then it would have to be referred to the Home Office and then to the Secretary of State .
905228:13	That action mainly has to be pressuring the Thames Water Utility Company to er to get its act together , and I must say that er since the last outbreak , they have been working hard at it .
905228:67	That action mainly has to be pressuring the Thames Water Utility Company to er to get its act together , and I must say that er since the last outbreak , they have been working hard at it .
905306:44	And I think er when it comes to homelessness , er we have to think very carefully about what we mean ; and sometimes er people think it 's er purely in terms of having er some kind of shelter , er and we have a lot of people in Oxford er , an estimate er has been a figure of , of three thousand people .
905312:186	Well , er not a lot is , is , is the honest answer , we , we work very hard at it of course , but er the truth is that er the only rights that people have are rights that can be enforced by law , and er in , in law , the only people that the local authority has to provide with accommodation are people who er have children who are particularly vulnerable , and there are very strict definitions of that .
905317:23	Now obviously er the , the government has to shift priorities , and that 's not something that 's going to change overnight , given the er , the attitude of central government towards these people at the moment , which is extremely negative .
905451:69	You wo n't be granted a divorce until a period of a year has elapsed and during that period you 'll have to work out access and maintenance for the children .
905456:15	We do n't actually have to have all that much meat .
905457:21	Only about a third of them has to be what you really call meat .
905471:77	Two of the women have said they are petrified amid warnings that war could break out soon , but they say they have to go .
905481:29	From early next year people using credit cards will have to pay more in some shops than people using money .
905485:34	What we will be doing is saying that it has to be clearly stated so that customers can see before they enter into the transaction and then we expect competitive forces in the market to make sure that the charges do n't get unrealistic .
905527:115	With the new proposals it seems the needs of the children will be put first because you wo n't be granted a divorce until a period of a year has elapsed and during that period you 'll have to work out access and maintenance for the children and put their needs first and that seems very good .
905539:39	No , what we would be doing is saying that it has to be clearly stated so that the customers can see before they enter into the transaction , and then we expect competitive forces in the market to make sure that the charges do n't get unrealistic .
905594:38	Conservatives on Oxfordshire County Council have dismissed claims that there 'll have to be major cuts in services if it has to stick to Government budget estimates .
905594:67	Conservatives on Oxfordshire County Council have dismissed claims that there 'll have to be major cuts in services if it has to stick to Government budget estimates .
905598:40	There will be one or two at the margins where we have to look at our priorities and one or two of them will have to be reassessed .
905598:76	There will be one or two at the margins where we have to look at our priorities and one or two of them will have to be reassessed .
905601:67	So , whilst the Council at its present level of spending under its present control , which is not ours , will have to make savings in expenditure , it is our belief it can be done without detriment to services .
905623:43	Chief Inspector , Robin Harrier , says the increase in crime means they must take more action .
905630:12	We then had to scale down our operations , and as a result the joyriders are back again , so again we have got to step up our operation .
905630:68	We then had to scale down our operations , and as a result the joyriders are back again , so again we have got to step up our operation .
905634:46	What we do need is the co-operation of the residents , and I must say that we are beginning to get the co-operation now and in fact many people did phone in after the last incident when the officers were assaulted , first of all asking for the condition of the officers and showing concern , and secondly giving us information .
905649:129	Why is that happening , because we like to assume in this country that we have enough safety nets to catch those people , to ensure while they may not live in the lap of luxury at least they do n't have to go without .
905657:48	From today , people parking their cars at the John Radcliffe Hospital in Oxford will have to pay and display .
905674:13	Often they will have to spend hours with the relatives .
905735:44	Manuela , who is known as Manola to most of her friends , had to give up her job at Cholsey 's Fairmile Hospital after twenty two years there because of the painful lung disease .
905748:61	The multi-national corporations , the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund are prolonging the process still today , and individuals have to , I believe , look at their own patterns of consumption and look at the way society in general works and work towards reducing levels of consumption in the rich countries so that we are more able to help the poor countries help themselves .
905750:28	Well , no , I mean er you have to look at particular areas .
905773:39	I suppose you 're hoping for good digging weather because you have to dig a fairly big hole to put a tree in it , do n't you ?
905774:12	Yes , you have to dig down as far as you can to get the roots in properly but , you know , it should be just the depth of one spade , so most people ought to be able to dig a hole that size .
905793:15	How long will we have to wait before you actually start to see it as a woodland roughly ?
905796:56	But then we are planning for the future , so that 's the sort of thing you have to do .
905820:7	I must say straight away this is a much better arrangement than last year .
905830:46	I might be wrong , but I do n't think so , but I have to sit on the fence you see as I get into trouble .
905834:49	He can be world champion for the next three years , so long as we do n't have to do it at Bradford because that 's an awful track .
905858:32	No , mind you , no , no , I must tell the truth , I enjoy myself when I 'm watching the Oxford University , or whatever it is , unless it 's Banbury United - oh , no , did n't mean it .
905859:7	I must stop taking the mickey out of Banbury United .
905873:72	Quite a lot of them did n't have all that much meat in them , which is not surprising , because they do n't actually have to have all that much meat , which we thought was quite amazing .
905874:21	Only about a third of them has to be what you 'd really call meat , and quite a lot of them had an enormous amount of fat in them .
905882:40	One if you want the best when you pig out you have to pay for them , and two they are not always as meaty as they might appear .
905890:17	The only problem I have to tell you about is the cancellation of the Banbury to Paddington train that was due to arrive at Oxford at three minutes past seven .
905985:43	But re-shuffle or not , Britain 's Euro-Commissioner , Sir Leon Brittain , says there must be a major overhaul of the Government 's attitude to Europe .
906005:32	He says it 's a shame John McGregor had to go from his post as Education Secretary .
906021:24	But , he said , they may have to prove that to the electorate .
906025:38	Everybody has their own style and tone , and we do n't all have to be clones one and another .
906027:20	Do you feel you will have to mend fences now ?
906028:40	Well , there will be a certain amount of explanation that will have to be done , because Geoffrey Howe is a well known , well liked figure among many people that I deal with er but now , and for some time now , for a year now , it 's I who have been dealing with them and I hope I 've inherited some of the work and some of the trust which he helped to create .
906029:23	Do you think now there will have to be a lot of morale building within the party ?
906055:78	Director of Social Services in Oxfordshire , Ian White , says most of the recommendations can be implemented with little cost , but expensive re-building must still be addressed .
906119:28	The mother of a north Oxfordshire girl who had to have her eye removed after an accident involving an airgun , is calling for a change in the gun laws .
906138:78	Our solicitor is fighting for that , but we seem as though we 're up against a brick wall at the moment , so we 'll have to just wait and see .
906140:58	At the moment , even children under fourteen can use airguns on private land , though youngsters under seventeen must be accompanied by an adult on public land .
906141:19	Ann Morley says all that must change if something good is to come out of Lisa 's accident .
906165:7	It must be demoralising for workers to be working alongside people who are being paid twice for doing the same job .
906247:21	And first of all , I must say good luck to the eleven local sides taking part in tomorrow 's curtain raiser at Twickers before we take on the argy-bargies and thrash them .
906287:12	Oxford City - must mention this - they 've got a two o' clock kick off at home to Tring Athletic because they 've got no flood lights , and where do you think those flood lights are , Jane ?
906297:39	A bonfire , planned for a playing field in East Oxford , has had to be cancelled because safety officials say its too dangerous .
906358:41	They 've got an experienced , strong squad and we 're going to have to play up to our strength to beat them .
906388:7	You have to have a very experienced driver .
906389:8	You have to have very good equipment , and you have to have the best start possible .
906389:34	You have to have very good equipment , and you have to have the best start possible .
906416:7	You have to be before nineteen O four to be in London to Brighton - before nineteen O five .
906419:7	It must take up all of your spare time just to keep it in tune .
906459:38	Yes , not a lot of mountains at Gloucester Green , I must say .
906464:13	When do people have to come along ?
906511:7	I must emphasize that I will not make a further reduction in interest rates until I 'm sure that it is safe and prudent to do so .
906544:181	Lester is one-dimensional ; there 's nothing else he can think about apart from riding race horses , and getting a bit of money as well also helps him , so the problem is , when you 're one-dimensional , you 're lost if you 're not doing the only thing you love and understand , and that must be a bit sad .
906556:25	Monetary policy will remain tight ; I must emphasize that I will not make a further reduction in interest rates until I am sure that it is safe and prudent to do so .
906564:59	Is the Prime Minister , who 's role in this affair is so crucial , that she simply must take part in the debate which we hope to have in this House ; why does she not admit it .
906625:68	We need to know who was to blame , we need a full open enquiry into this incident , and we must make sure that this sort of thing never happens again .
906630:164	Although we 're working er all the time to keep security as tight as we can at the John Radcliffe , er the scheme is going to give us the ability to challenge members of staff , legitimate members of staff , as we currently do , er and they will then have to provide , produce the card , er so we can then assess whether they are or are not a member of staff .
906646:41	Well clearly it 's devastating news ; er unfortunately I think we have to say that we 're not tremendously surprised .
906647:162	The news is that heterosexuals had become infected with H I V , the virus that leads to AIDS , ten to fifteen years ago , and that the numbers were doubling ten to fifteen years ago , that 's what it means when we hear AIDS cases , and what that must mean for today , is horrifying .
906650:17	It shows that we must step up our efforts to ensure that everyone is fully educated , but not only that they know the facts , but that they start to act upon them .
906678:98	I do n't actually think that , that , that it 's quite so clear cut , I think that there 's still a bit of persuading that , that we have to do to persuade people that it is the right thing .
906682:77	The Environment Secretary , Chris Patten has agreed to alterations to the County 's structure plan , but it 's still not clear whether the Authority will have to proceed with a controversial scheme for a gravel pit at Finmere .
906691:80	The plan does n't point to Finmere as an area where there 's a resumption in favour of mineral working , so what we will have to do with the Finmere proposals , is to look at it on its merits .
906695:33	Well , it , it does n't mean that permission has to be granted at Finmere , but it , it would make it more difficult to refuse .
906744:92	How has it been for yourself , obviously you 've been here with your children , your husband 's been away for more than a month , in Iraq , there must have been er terrible thoughts going through you mind at certain times ?
906774:38	However , comments by the American Banker 's President that U S industry must shed more jobs , saw Wall Street lose thirty four points .
906798:39	Okay Mickey , it 's a , it 's a Monday night , had to think there for a minute .
906809:87	The Chairman of Oxford United , Kevin Maxwell , says unless he gets planning permission for a new twenty two thousand seater stadium , the club is going to have to close .
906814:190	I mean , it 's , it 's er , it 's er very regrettable that it literally takes er a very good er Cup er run for Oxford to stand any chance of breaking even in a season , and if you consistently lose anywhere between ten and fourteen thousand pounds a week , er it 's almost inevitable that you will have to close .
906853:154	And then she came bounding back and could n't stop herself , went straight into Doreen , knocked Doreen off her legs completely , and she was just sprawled out on all fours , it was just hilarious , we , in fact we did an action replay on that because you had to see it again to believe it .
906858:45	It gave us a bit of a giggle in the office , but I have to say it 's not the sort of thing that we would show to the public .
906895:36	Conditions are jolly hot there , and they 're going to have to get used to that quite quickly , the big thing is to get them through and out into the desert as quickly as possible .
906928:133	So we 're hoping to address all these issues and er and also to try to bring people back to the awareness that food is a basic human right , the right to eat is a basic human right and , and that we have to find ways to make sure people enjoy that basic human right .
907015:100	He was n't er able to be so positive as that , but he did certainly give us the impression that er that he 'd listened very carefully to what we had to say .
907017:15	I think we have to say that er I would imagine that plans are well advanced for the nineteen ninety/ninety one/ninety two settlement , er so it may not be immediately that er we will get the benefit of what we said to him .
907050:132	Well it , it 's likely to be of charged under one of the loose clauses of anti-government er activities which really could mean anything , and so there , it 's more likely to be that , and if so , we have to look at the evidence then that was used to back up this claim .
907097:138	We 're there for , to give the help and advice that people need on the day to day living , er because a person with say with a respiratory illness , er would need a lot of benefits er they , their lifestyle has to change , and often their home and adaptation has to change with , around it .
907097:162	We 're there for , to give the help and advice that people need on the day to day living , er because a person with say with a respiratory illness , er would need a lot of benefits er they , their lifestyle has to change , and often their home and adaptation has to change with , around it .
907106:17	And do , do people have to apply to the Association ?
907119:97	I think there will be many differences in our education system now , we do n't know what er system we take from West Germany as you know , we have to overtake nearly everything and we have to lose many things which were quite good in our old system and now we do n't have the chance to er to bring it into the connection between East and West Germany , so that is one problem .
907119:119	I think there will be many differences in our education system now , we do n't know what er system we take from West Germany as you know , we have to overtake nearly everything and we have to lose many things which were quite good in our old system and now we do n't have the chance to er to bring it into the connection between East and West Germany , so that is one problem .
907139:150	It just goes to show how well he 's done , he was playing in the early seventies , but we should win ; what we 've got to do tomorrow is not just win well , but we 've got to pick up those points , we must win .
907148:90	I do n't think Paul Kee will play , and to be perfectly honest , I do n't think Jim Magilton will play , but we 're going to have to wait until tomorrow ; Billy Bingham just ca n't make up his mind .
907149:15	, Well we 'll have to wait for that one .
907169:50	You know , I thought he was about fifty odd , but what I must mention Jane , must n't forget in his first race in the three o' clock , he came last on Ruddy Cheek .
907169:61	You know , I thought he was about fifty odd , but what I must mention Jane , must n't forget in his first race in the three o' clock , he came last on Ruddy Cheek .
907200:75	It 's , it 's a hefty tome , but , some encyclopaedias run to about you know , fifteen volumes , so it must have been quite an editorial job actually .
907334:7	It must n't become a new focus for fascists .
907345:27	The young , unable to fly away , must rely on their parents making a two hundred and fifty mile round trip to other lakes and rivers to find food .
907354:35	Before the telescope could be deployed , two huge solar panels had to be unfurled .
907445:102	His classmates started , started to curse erm to curse him and to humiliate him I think from the first or the second grade , and erm he was my friend , I had to , to fight for him .
907625:49	The military place strict limits on the size and location of election rallies , and campaign speeches had to be approved by government centres .
907684:7	They have to prove they left Cambodia for political , not economic reasons , before being allowed to stay .
907797:8	I have to be very careful , not for myself only , it 's for everybody else , every other Kuwaiti .
907896:14	But the volunteers have had to borrow one hundred thousand pounds so far to set it up .
907897:34	The response is coming through slowly , but we 've had to take a lot of initiatives on our own and we are hoping that others will come and support and back these initiatives .
907933:64	Jane Copley , sister of Joanna Copley who set up the help line was in no doubt about what must be done now .
908017:35	However the conservationists and oil companies both agree that President Bush must now come up with a viable energy policy .
908123:18	The details of this release must be worked out by the international Red Cross .
908147:190	At the same time , one introduces the idea of thermal energy , heat , and in many situations the requirement is in fact is to start from energy in one form , such as heat from burning oil , to satisfy a requirement for energy in another form , in other words mechanical energy - the turning of a shaft - so somewhere there has to be a device which converts the heat energy into mechanical energy .
908160:91	It 's to say that there maybe some rather simple scientific idea behind some idea , but in practice there are so many other constraints and limitations , but all these have to be taken into account .
908187:40	I would expect that we will use nuclear power , but you have to get it into perspective .
908193:47	They supply a constant load , therefore , so the user , the electricity user , has to be persuaded to even out his use of electricity , so night storage heaters are sold to people , just to be switched on at night , in order to provide a smoothing of the demand load .
908194:63	And of course heating your house in the middle of the night is not what everybody wants , so there has to be an attractive price to persuade people to do that and to invest in the storage heaters , hence the half price electricity .
908238:25	In terms of the weight you have to carry around , it is a light fuel .
908249:156	That , in some cases , that has been explored for the storage of heat in the summer which you would then use in the winter , but everywhere one comes back to storage nuclear power stations cannot be turned up and down quickly at the moment , so either with electricity you have to have a uniform demand for electricity , or you have to , say , burn gas to provide an alternative way of generating electricity which can be turned up and down at will .
908249:188	That , in some cases , that has been explored for the storage of heat in the summer which you would then use in the winter , but everywhere one comes back to storage nuclear power stations cannot be turned up and down quickly at the moment , so either with electricity you have to have a uniform demand for electricity , or you have to , say , burn gas to provide an alternative way of generating electricity which can be turned up and down at will .
908315:19	The demand industrially of course , has to some extent followed the fortunes of the national economy .
908375:138	Some of the newly qualified teachers , perhaps , found some difficulties initially in coping with the wide range of abilities their mixed ability classes presented them with , and in some ways the school was not well provided with in-service support for mixed ability teaching and had to do a lot of their own work in terms of the appropriate methods to choose , the appropriate resources , the appropriate materials to develop .
908392:24	Well I think really what one must look for now is more detailed research on what actually goes on in mixed ability classrooms .
908395:52	Really it 's a problem of time and resources erm the difficulties are that one has to spend a lot of time sitting in the classroom working with the teacher , or observing the teacher and it 's difficult to find that time when one is teaching at university .
908413:28	If anything I think women 's education now has to compensate a little erm and provide for those areas in which women start in a way that could be considered a handicap to men .
908414:107	They start behind men in certain ways because of the sort of training they are getting in school , in the home I mean , and in so many respects I think schools have to try and compensate for that .
908418:46	On the other hand , my own feeling would be very much that schools have to prepare children for taking their life in the community and the community is mixed sex , it 's not single sex , so I have a slight aversion to single sex institutions .
908434:46	You could argue that some of them work outside the home because they have to , for financial reasons , but I think it 's indisputable that a ever-growing number want to work outside the home and I think it 's very important that they should be allowed the scope to do so .
908435:214	erm there 's no doubt that our society , whatever kind of sentimental things it says about the status of the housewife , gives the housewife extremely low status , and that power and status and respect in society are accorded to people who achieve things in the work world occupationally outside the home , and given that that is so I think women , to increase their self respect , have got to achieve things outside the home , yes .
908443:62	erm if you 're going to have a self at all in our society I think it has to be one that 's defined in relation to the occupational world .
908450:40	Most women grow up absolutely torn and still somehow knowing that they have to make some kind of choice .
908455:23	Women still , on the whole , have to achieve more than men to get to the same level in certain ways , but I think basically it 's this question of choice .
908463:10	You only have to look at the unemployment amongst married women who would like to be teachers .
908467:85	I mean when I think of all the money that was poured into my education and nobody ever mentioned the kind of decisions one would have to make in the future and the problems you would have in trying to make use both of your education and have children and have the happy family life that our society encourages you to have and that we all perhaps want .
908469:94	It 's easier sometimes not to achieve and just to settle for family life than it is to achieve and to set your occupational sights quite high and then to have to face the terrible and fight of having both a job and children .
908476:29	Education , particularly for women , in that period must have changed enormously ?
908483:63	I mean the very small number of girls that did get to university at the turn of the century had to endure the most extraordinary trials and hardships .
908484:22	I mean most of them had to go chaperoned to lectures and things .
908524:23	They do n't achieve because they have to choose , and the only way to get women achieving in a sort of relaxed way is not to force them with the choice between occupation success and families .
908536:184	They are very tolerant about boys ' mess in the home and untidiness generally , and in a sense they lay the foundations right from the very beginning of boys growing up to think of women as kind of household servants - this attitude , you know , boys will be boys and they make a mess and poor mum has to do all the washing .
908542:30	I might run on so much you 'll have to stop me
908563:7	You must know that !
908585:77	And erm they were determined that we should all work near as proficient in milking to go and take over , so we had to learn to hand milk , to use three different types of milking machines and to do all the necessary sterilizing and everything else , so that we could be used straight away when we got to the farm .
908588:26	Six o' clock in the morning , I had to clean out the Danish piggeries .
908613:10	Well it must be there then !
908618:14	Yes , well we had to dig from half past nine in the morning until half past five at night non-stop .
908635:12	You do n't have to be behind them when they cough !
908639:60	They put us in the deep end with everything that came along , you know , you really had to learn by doing it .
908669:27	He was a hard worker , and you had to set these pens every time for the sheep you see , well he could carry three hurdles on his back , and I could , five , that 's right five , and I could carry three , he carried five .
908674:7	We had to do everything else ourselves .
908681:55	The end of the bath the toilets and the loo which is a little Elsan , we had to empty that , opposite us there was the door into the living room , the hearth of the living room we had an open fire and we .
908683:82	Once a week bath night , now we do all these dirty jobs , because next door she had her own coal Lashmere cooking you see , and we had to make do with wood , and that entails cutting it ourselves , so our weekend , we worked Saturday mornings ; Sunday used to the day we had to do all the cottage work .
908683:170	Once a week bath night , now we do all these dirty jobs , because next door she had her own coal Lashmere cooking you see , and we had to make do with wood , and that entails cutting it ourselves , so our weekend , we worked Saturday mornings ; Sunday used to the day we had to do all the cottage work .
908714:112	Well , there were these round concrete blocks , with silos at the top , and they used to come in with these loads of scraps , tip it in and you know what we had to do ?
908715:22	With a great big cans , you had to fill it with that molasses , and we had to pour this all over the grass and then , shorts , our shorts were cut off breeches you see because then we used to wear them first and we cut off them off to make shorts .
908715:52	With a great big cans , you had to fill it with that molasses , and we had to pour this all over the grass and then , shorts , our shorts were cut off breeches you see because then we used to wear them first and we cut off them off to make shorts .
908724:90	You see the tractor driving it , there 's the load , this was gathering up the hay as it went along and it tipped it over and we had to make the loads you see .
908725:167	And we called it the man-killer because we had ridge and furrow land down there , and this darn thing they was taking , and nothing would come over the top for ages , and suddenly the whole lot would come over on top of you , of course it as well , and you had to that 's what we were doing .
908730:202	This is when we all got cut fingers , you know that , you cut it just right the crown , and you try to be quick , we all got these marks on the forefinger , sugar beet and swede , you know you took a swede and put it on the heap in one go , you know , well , with sugar beet you had to be more careful , did n't you , you cut the crown
908779:85	I do n't know what happened about that , but it probably was put in a heap to rot , but I remember that one load we had to take out was dreadful , it was all wadded and it was heavy , and we could not separate it , you know wrecked my back .
908803:12	You do n't have to hammer it out just because we 're being recorded Jeremy !
908888:34	I can make leads , I mean , if you have to do it , if I had a spare moment
908896:13	This morning I had to connect up a video for Caroline to use and all the leads , every single lead we 've got , to connect any machine to any machine , were all bundled in like a load missing , and it took me what , five minutes to find the right leads and connect the machines up .
908909:65	Bringing it back to my point , though , there are people , if you have a typewriter , you do n't have to know how to work the typewriter , erm it seems to me , that we 're actually , the more we do , we make matters worse for ourselves .
908922:198	I mean , it 's not a great , from a computing point of view , it 's not great having some erm you know vast faceless organisation which is going to make sure everything 's alright , because it means that when something goes wrong , it takes weeks and weeks and weeks to get it sorted out , because you have to fill in a form in triplicate , get it signed
908923:14	mhm And they have to buy everything for you , and it takes ages does n't it .
909025:15	I think we had to accept that the first programmes were just to get the whole thing working really erm .
909159:16	Are we having we have to vote here ?
909207:92	But it really does n't matter how we who does the job description erm whether it 's you , or whether it 's me or your manager , but it has to be agreed erm by both parties .
909221:121	erm When the the the job description is signed it ought to be passed by a job analyst just to make sure to check the things that erm it has been done properly and then it has to be signed by the erm job holder , the job holder 's manager and the head of division , and it has to be got to personnel .
909221:184	erm When the the the job description is signed it ought to be passed by a job analyst just to make sure to check the things that erm it has been done properly and then it has to be signed by the erm job holder , the job holder 's manager and the head of division , and it has to be got to personnel .
909222:12	All job descriptions have got to be done not later than the twenty ninth of June .
909295:83	We looked so thin on the ground , I thought we 'd sit and wait and see if everyone 's coming , but erm we 'll have to get started anyway .
909435:47	erm I think the general pressure on tropical governments now from the environmental lobby has got to the point where they are n't they 're beginning to realise the problems .
909445:89	Well , I 'm in agreement with you , and I think most environmentalists are in agreement that sustained growth is the way forward , and they have to be sustainable for the economies of the people who actually live there to survive , and sustainable for the whole planet to survive .
909591:92	And we look forward to seeing some more publicity , between us we have fingers in many pies , and the more we know about it the more chance we have to spread the word around .
909604:14	But other things will have to be worked through .
909633:10	We 'll have to find a suitable date for instance
909676:79	Yes , because the snag is with that is that it means the vast amount of , and then the gypsum that is produced has got to be disposed of has n't it , so that the limestone is mined and then they 've got to get rid of the gypsum .
909681:15	So , we shall have to get a letter out to him .
909682:41	Yes , can we do it by this committee , or do we have to go though .
909702:55	Office , who are setting up a permanent acid rain monitor as well , so then we 'd have to , so then I 've got to get back in touch with that person .
909706:10	It really must make the school children feel that they 've really done some important research .
909888:61	I mean it is a possibility , and if he 's going to be awkward perhaps we 'll have to just make sure that we do that , which is presumably fairly easy , if the post goes out from the same office .
909925:16	Oh , we 'll have to be careful , then , wo n't we !
909926:10	You may have to be careful .
909982:48	The health authority has for years not shown any signs of so doing , I have to say .
909988:30	erm Under the new erm system erm every G P must at some time during the visit erm persons over seventy-five .
909989:108	Now , what are you doing to ensure that erm that this is carried out because a lot of elderly , they will not go to the doctor , but erm the doctor I believe has got to go and see them .
910029:17	As someone who has to ask occasionally for a care package for an individual , do I take it then the penultimate paragraph that this is the planning , you know , how you 're going to produce a care package for an individual , this is what you refer to in the planning system , and that you 're getting together with Social Services to get this care package together ?
910073:23	Basically , the latest , and I must n't take any credit , and there seemed to be some credit , Chair .
910130:101	I mean , we all know that having to shake tins , the number of people who go past by on the other side , and I think that we do have to be careful with the numbers , and even those people who normally give do get a bit fed up if there are too many .
910143:51	It is to a degree , on the application form that each charity receives , it has to state whether it collects for people in the Oxford area , but not as a percentage .
910145:165	I mean , I think a lot of national organisations that are giving , I trust that are giving money to people actually do want to know that sort of detail about where the money is going , because , if I go through this , I mean , I would have to say that I should imagine that a very small percentage of the money that has been collected on these flag days will actually get back into Oxfordshire .
910170:75	Will you agree to grant three band collection permits , which you 've done before , which are usually great fun , I must say .
910220:7	We have to do something about the equity target .
910270:8	We have to allow them to take some decisions within our decision , I think , but I 'm sure they 'll take your point anyway .
910476:71	We take samples throughout the year from the river , but they 're really at background level , and not very helpful I must admit , in terms of getting the quality of the river improved , we ca n't do that .
910482:28	In order to serve a notice you have to get a name , and that 's enormously difficult , because I mean , practical difficulties need to be taken on board , Anne and then Diana .
910483:14	Well , having had to avail ourselves of the help of the officer who got rid of our gigantic wasp nest , I should like to say what a superb job they do , but I just wondered in view of the tremendous number , whether there is some kind of way of preventions .
910528:81	erm Although one would hate to be , I do n't want to be accused of being elitist and saying that E H O 's must do a particular job , but what I would like to say it that we need people who are trained to a sufficient level to be able to do the ultra high risk catering area , as distinct from other high-risk areas .
910552:23	And , I mean , reluctantly we have to accept that this is not an ideal world , but I mean , just now , we were actually looking at the number of food hygiene inspections that have been done over the last few months , which have increased enormously , it just means , I mean it emphasises the fact that food has changed , food , and the number of places that are actually serving food now I mean , the corner shop does sandwiches .
910554:61	I realise that many of these are not high-risk areas , but they are areas that our officers have got to , got to keep an eye on .
910597:178	We gave them a sheet of paper which said what we were , what we 're doing , and said please , if you want any help in any of those areas , just tick the box , and if you do n't want any help , tick this little box , and that 's what they had to fill in .
910599:39	We discovered very rapidly that if it was the doctor that had to present the age-well project to the patients that quite often they forgot to do it .
910672:8	You had to buy too many fonts , and it was too expensive , and people did n't want to by linotype matrices of that size .
910676:123	Well , this get 's back to that , that typo-lecture , typo-visuel thing , the difference between reading type and illustration type , that if you 're actually designing pages that people are going to read , then you have to start with the text .
910684:35	Sadly , they did n't let me - you do n't have to put this in here - but they did n't let me finish correcting the proofs , cos one of those things , four times is enough .
910775:84	On the whole I would prefer to have that Lanston Monotype 's Cochin than Matthews , but when you get up to , I mean , you have to do that cochin black that 's fantastic in display sizes .
910794:21	They had a catalogue that had to be printed .
910795:57	There was an art exhibition and because the school was spending money to print it he had to get involved .
910820:100	Well the theory is that you do n't , in metal type if you have a line of caps you ca n't just jamb another line right under the baseline because there has to be room for the ascenders , descenders .
910823:65	And you can mass type , erm mass headlines , and we do negative type leading and all the rest , but you have to add up that extra descender space and put it at the bottom of the headline .
910824:10	So there has to be - and we always exaggerate that space a bit .
910835:48	Once they 've got it , they can do my layout and I do n't have to be there .
910861:31	A lot of his personality , you know you have to like jolly people into liking and sublimating what their own inclination would be to some kind of group style .
910862:37	It 's the same job as an editor of a publication has to get writers to go along without it all sounding like he wrote it or she wrote it , and the , but a good editor can figure out how to do that and a good writer likes it because it means erm they 'll go together or work better and readers will like it , understand it .
910866:60	Within the Rolling Stone thing , I mean , part of it has you as the chief designer and you have to accept the notion that two heads are better than one , which means designers cannot
910873:42	Sometimes if it 's completely wrong you start over , or you have to get in and actually wade into the paper and do some design work on it , but the other thing is allowing a certain sense of experimentation .
910885:53	In a group effort , like a publication or a magazine , you know , you do n't have to hold people back , they 'll go all the way .
910918:14	And thus the reader has to go more than the usual way he goes to understand what he 's looking at .
910992:10	I even had to hand letter it to get it to get it to look like itself .
911064:13	You do n't have to like , make any room for it at all , and you can start doing paint layup and but you can do magazine pages .
911161:65	, but Benguiat took it as like a threat to and went after him in the lobby of hall and they had to be prised apart .
911267:125	So you could actually , if you 've got , if you then put , if those graphics people were fairly high powered art directors and they did n't , they did n't , they were n't like , did n't have to show all their stuff , that they had enough news sense to not make any more mistakes than most layout people do on newspapers , which are sometimes colossal , like burying the lead or putting the big story on page thirty-eight , you know .
911366:7	We had to change the lock on their door , and the bloody lock cost thirty seven quid and each key cost five quid to cut , so we 're giving them fifty seven quids worth of security for nothing and they complain because I 'm not out by twelve o' clock .
911368:36	Georgiana Greenwood may have been partly to blame , but it had to do with the fact that we really were n't running the conference out of the college .
911427:10	I 'll have to find out what he 's done .
911431:69	What I keep trying to tell him is that if you do something like this , this space underneath has to be at least as much between the top of the S as the and the baseline and they sell them .
911444:15	No , you just have to sign it and take your receipt .
911495:7	I must say I 've been seriously wondering , during this lecture , whether I was going to have the courage or not , to attempt to give you a thumbnail exposition of Hegelian metaphysics .
911502:35	Therefore all understanding , in any way worthy the name , has to begin from the whole of reality as such , and proceed outwards from there to the details of the world as we know it .
911504:68	Two is that there , in some sense , some perhaps rather extended and difficult sense , this totality of everything which we have to take by storm directly if any detail of the world is every to be understood , can be said to be mental .
911515:56	He came , towards the end of the nineties , to believe that there are erm there must be things which are in the strictest possible sense non-mental , and which would be what they were , even if there had never been any minds that were conscious of them .
911517:15	Hence philosophical analysis can and must proceed by erm philosophical thinking must proceed by analysis , by breaking down complex wholes into their simple parts and building them up by construction out of these simple parts , a conviction to which Russell remained true for the rest of his life .
911517:34	Hence philosophical analysis can and must proceed by erm philosophical thinking must proceed by analysis , by breaking down complex wholes into their simple parts and building them up by construction out of these simple parts , a conviction to which Russell remained true for the rest of his life .
911560:10	I shall have to think about that as I proceed , sha n't I ?
911579:44	And I think there is a deeper sense in which erm one must n't conceive the breakdown of a philosophical enterprise , like this one of Russell 's , as being a failure .
911614:80	That 's to say that men embody themselves in partial versions of themselves , and then , in order to realize themselves more fully , they have to overcome by many kinds of struggle this previous realization .
911616:73	But , once it exists , it can become a shackle rather than an inspiration , and when it does do so , one has to seek to destroy it , and thence the animus of Russell 's attacks on organized religion .
911624:15	So what the philosopher has to do is to look at these , all these various factors and begin to try and make people conscious of the inadequacies of the way in which they live , and of the new possibilities which are open to them , if they will only project their minds outside the established bounds .
911644:90	What he 's trying to do is always to get outside ideological systems , and to present arguments which are simply in terms of what we must all desire .
911698:15	Bob Henry , you must be aware of some of the criticisms which were levelled at the companies which were put out by arts associations , where they say really it 's very self-indulgent and nobody much goes to see this particular type of dance group .
911710:166	Certainly some of the productions that we are responsible for , as I have said , are controversial , and some of the public might not really want them and might dispute their validity , but I think what it is an indication of is the fact that people are short of money and have to make quite sure that they are getting the best value for what they are paying for and they ca n't afford to go to the theatre as regularly as they might have done in the past .
911711:91	But given that you 're really in the market place situation , if you have goods which nobody wants to sell then eventually you 're going to have to grind to a halt .
911717:13	Bob , you must n't rustle .
911729:40	I think the whole nature of artistic practice is that the artist must have a considerable amount of freedom .
911748:161	It is invariably one whereby people have applied for those grants , they have gone through all the normal assessment criteria , which apply to any other art form , and if we feel that they adequately cover all those sort of areas then we respond , but as public body we have to be aware that groups , in applying to us , must fulfil the conditions that we lay down .
911748:199	It is invariably one whereby people have applied for those grants , they have gone through all the normal assessment criteria , which apply to any other art form , and if we feel that they adequately cover all those sort of areas then we respond , but as public body we have to be aware that groups , in applying to us , must fulfil the conditions that we lay down .
911750:30	Well we erm , in the sense that they must be legally constituted .
911751:110	I mean there are a number of different forms that can take erm they could be a co-operative , registered with a friendly industrial society , or have a board of directors , but there must be a legal personality to the organization in order for them to receive public funds .
911770:10	Now you must be aware that whenever public money is involved in anything to do with the arts , that there is always a lot of criticism about how that money is spent .
911776:43	We are accountable to the public in many different ways , and we always have to keep an eye on the fact that the public are looking at what we are doing with our money and local politicians and the community 's representatives are always anxious to talk to us about what we are doing with that money and we must be prepared to answer any queries or any questions on our activities or those activities of people that we 're sponsoring .
911776:182	We are accountable to the public in many different ways , and we always have to keep an eye on the fact that the public are looking at what we are doing with our money and local politicians and the community 's representatives are always anxious to talk to us about what we are doing with that money and we must be prepared to answer any queries or any questions on our activities or those activities of people that we 're sponsoring .
911778:35	I mean the public is going to say we must have houses , we must have roads , must we have arts ?
911778:50	I mean the public is going to say we must have houses , we must have roads , must we have arts ?
911778:61	I mean the public is going to say we must have houses , we must have roads , must we have arts ?
911798:9	But you must have heard the criticism for things like the pile of bricks , the pile of carpet felt .
911810:35	Richard Moor , as Deputy Director of South East Arts , you have to work very closely with a number of people , some trained , some untrained .
911816:7	One has to try and explain what it is we are about and why we 're doing it and , if necessary , perhaps point out a few distinctions that may exist , for instance , between the professional and the amateur scene , not that I like using those words because I think they 're fraught with all sort of potential misunderstandings .
911820:18	Well I suppose we have to start with what we 're doing .
911842:40	And to put this activity into some sort of financial context , we have to help us a budget of roughly half a million pounds .
911976:22	Speaking too fast , so you have to say , I 'm sorry can you repeat that , which makes you feel like an idiot because you did n't pick it up first time , that 's awful , yes I know , I know that one !
911986:32	Yes , that 's true , what so you have to hold the phone away from your ear , and then everybody else in the office can hear the conversation as well as you can .
911990:55	Not getting a reply fast enough came top of the list , especially when you know there must be somebody there , so when there 's a telephone just ringing and nobody answers it .
912064:33	To volunteer useful information , so that the caller does n't have to go through asking you questions .
912099:37	Just nine first and you dial straight through , you do n't have to wait for a secondary dialling tone do you ?
912208:133	It only works if you realise that your own extension number is going to be vacant at the time , if somebody 's using it then it wo n't work , alright , so if you try and transfer a call , then you must make sure that the extension number you 're accessing is free .
912213:27	So you say to the person , you must say to them , I 'm going to put you on call park , do n't worry about it , do n't go away , I wo n't be a minute or two .
912248:14	And you do n't have to write silly .
912256:13	Mary , you must try and transfer it , do n't you , because you ca n't see that Jo 's handset 's off the hook , we 'll assume that we know that , okay , we 'll cheat , we 'll try and call park it .
912273:20	I think actually , you have to be set up in a conversation first .
912358:10	We 'll have to get rid of that noise !
912365:27	Well , you might think that you have to re-input the camp on , but you do n't , the camp on only cancels itself if you choose to ignore it or if it matures .
912385:195	No , what I meant , is if saying that if I camped onto that number over there 3414 , and if that phone becomes free , this phone starts ringing and I might be doing something , so by the time I 've picked it up to make that connection , suppose 3414 is then making another outgoing call , do I have to camp on yet again to 3414 ?
912388:99	But , if it 's ringing because it was successful , i.e. the camp on has matured , and you 've chosen not to look at it , then yes you will have to re-input your camp on .
912395:7	Nobody has to answer a telephone , so , alright .
912439:10	We 've had to set it up like that , because sometimes people working late would like to pick up calls , expecting a call , or pick up calls on a different handset , .
912440:80	To pick up these calls , all you need do , when you hear these screaming bells , anybody can do it , it does n't have to be within your area , okay .
912476:19	And the only thing you have to ask me about is the group pick up , which I have n't mentioned have I .
912481:51	The beauty of the system is , group pick up , is that you do n't have to know the extension number of the phone ringing , obviously , star star 3 , that 's it .
912483:104	Call pick up , as opposed to group pick up , call pick up , should be on there , is star 3 and the extension number , and as you can imagine , you have to know what the extension number is before you actually access the facility .
912484:24	Because it wo n't work , you have to know the exact extension that 's ringing .
912497:42	If you want to speak to the operator , then , yes you must phone and ask them to get the operator for you .
912508:43	Now we bill out the divisions , okay , and the divisions bills have to be quite accurate , and obviously we one or two extension numbers which are new .
912550:112	So Spurs getting the lead they so dearly wanted after all their upsets of recent weeks , but back came United in the eighteenth minute , Les Phillips sent Nogan free over the halfway line and Eric Torsville had to race from his line to hack the ball into the stand .
912568:34	United then began to pile men forward as they had to , Simpson causing problems down the left , Phillips again in mid-field winning a lot of ball , but of course United leaving a few gaps at the back , and just before the finish , four minutes before the finish , that man Gascoigne put the game beyond United 's reach , giving Spurs a four two victory .
912648:34	Well a very close fought encounter at the stadium ; we had to wait for quarter of an hour for the first actual goal chance when Dave Bristow hit the ball from twenty five yards , which just cleared the bar .
912693:133	West Ham doing so well in the second division went to first division Luton , and by half time they were in front , a Pariss goal after forty three minutes , but Luton hit back in the seventieth minute through Black , and these two sides must replay .
912697:60	Manchester United at home to Bolton were held to a goal-less first half first forty five minutes , and they had to wait until the seventy seventh minute before taking the lead through Hughes , and United go through with a one nil win .
912709:7	I had to make the decision , do I put Mickey Lewis on him , leave Martin Foyle out and stick Mickey Lewis on Gascoigne ?
912715:111	Absolutely , you did n't come here and kick and rush , you did n't come here and defend , you played some delightful football , football I know you always like to play , that must have pleased you the way the game was played .
912720:18	erm We 'll just have to see what goes now this week , but erm I 'm pleased with Foyly .
912724:36	You know , it is a pressure job and Terry must have been under pressure today because if we 'd have beaten them , then you know their season would have crumbled .
912729:107	I think we competed today but erm maybe one or two areas where I thought we might have got stuck in a little bit more you know , and we 're going to have to do that against Oldham I tell you because they 'll pass and have players that can do tricks erm good side are n't they ?
912737:8	Bicester had to withstand incessant Old Boys pressure in the final quarter of an hour , finally were outright winners by twelve points to seven .
912768:29	And a try for you today , that must have sealed it for you
912802:99	The second leg of our yankee is the eight forty five , well this is a sprint race ; two fifty metres , only erm only go round two bends , and therefore you have to have some erm early pace sort of erm greyhounds , and I 'm going to go for a trap one here , Chair Boy 's Blue , he 's already won plenty over this erm shorter trip .
912808:18	He 's going to have to improve a little bit on his last win , but I think he can do that , so that 's the fourth leg of a yankee , trap one , Ambridge Power .
912848:11	Well Charlton had to improve in the second half , and they did ; they got more men into mid-field , and United began to run out of a little bit of steam .
912857:100	As I said , at half time , you could n't believe Oxford United were n't going to get three points out of this game , but they did n't , and now they have to fight on .
912874:80	Worse was to come though for Horsham as following a fifty fifty challenge on the edge of the Abingdon area , striker Paul Walker injured himself and had to be stretchered off .
912911:91	In the second half , the play was very even erm Barry Cooper away on the left , he slipped the ball to Jason Allen who scored number three , Leach had to save a high shot from Nigel Chambers who then conceded a corner doing so , the nearest as they came to scoring , and looked down just at that stage .
912965:15	erm We had to look for some lower riders and erm Tony Primmer of course comes in at four , which helps us immensely .
912970:11	Bernard I must tell you , listening to you at the moment is Simon Wigg on one of our other lines erm just a word about Simon before I bring him in .
912972:187	Absolutely , you see the sad thing is that Simon has a seven point five five average erm we sort of balance that out , you know , erm Simon to go and bring in a six point National League boy - it 's not a clever situation at all in my book , but then the rules are the rules and we have to go along with it .
912994:99	So erm I 'm looking forward to this season much more than I have for a long time , so I ca n't wait , wherever I end up , we 'll have to see , but erm I 'm looking forward to it anyway .
913013:21	Right and how many times , I must ask you finally , how many times will you be fined by the referees this year , you claimed a nil sheet last year , remarkably
913096:46	That 's right , playing at number four and scoring every week , he must be erm very happy indeed .
913116:48	I agree with that , erm I think that the big city clubs will have to eventually start sharing .
913117:93	It becomes so expensive erm and if we are going to get new facilities erm we ca n't just keep upgrading what we 've got now , we have to build new .
913118:59	erm And if we are going to compete in world sport then erm and if we have to apply like Manchester , who 's applying for the Olympic Games , we have to have the appropriate stadia .
913118:104	erm And if we are going to compete in world sport then erm and if we have to apply like Manchester , who 's applying for the Olympic Games , we have to have the appropriate stadia .
913119:68	We 're not going to get it by resurrecting the stadia that we 've got at the moment ; new ones have to be built , and if they 're going to be built in the high population areas , you know , then I think it 's realistic for the clubs in that particular area to share .
913133:44	erm Unfortunately when you 're short of money , you know , you have to try and get it from wherever you can and of course , in lots of cases , the supermarket chains have actually bailed out some football clubs , you know , by buying pieces of the car park etc .
913135:76	We ca n't just keep asking the people that actually pay to come to the matches to do it all the time , they have to be supplemented from industry anyway .
913137:12	Big industry will have to take a bigger share of the professional clubs .
913149:14	But football generally speaking has to be the biggest , simply because it is the most popular still .
913160:61	Just one Peter yes , but we 'll put that down to the going I think , we 'll have to put it down to something , so we 'll put it down to the going .
913239:26	Couple of good saves today you must be pleased with ; Wittingham got in one very good header did n't he .
913245:73	Since you signed it 's been a little bit up and down , some goals conceded , not necessarily down to you , so you must be pleased that things have settled down a bit ?
913252:17	Oh yes , you only had to listen to this afternoon like , with the crowds and that , obviously it means a lot to them and there 's a lot of you know , stick I suppose goes around between the two clubs , so I just want to go out there , hopefully have a good game and keep a clean sheet .
913255:100	And that 's Nick Harris talking to Ken Vasey up at the Manor ground and we hope to return to the Manor in a few moments time and see who else Nick has got to talk to us .
913294:60	Yes , what it was , early in the season when I was playing left back erm I had to stay back , but recently because I 'm playing centre half , I get up to get the set pieces , so it 's nice for me as well .
913328:118	As the game entered the closing stages , both sides had good chances to score ; the first fell to Steve Jenkins who was evaded by inches from Mickey Wiggins ' cross , whilst up the other end , Warner had to be on his toes when he held a point blank header from John Parry .
913396:81	So there we are , lines are open , three double one , one double one , I see one or two are ringing already , you 'll have to be very quick .
913455:65	A reminder that if you are going to the game , of course if is all tickets , so you must get your tickets from Oxford United before setting off on Tuesday evening .
913459:77	Barring a calamity erm they will retain their option with us to continue on a two year deal , erm they perhaps , and I have to erm be honest about this , I think they are probably in a marketing sense , the most aggressive erm marketing company that I 've ever witnessed in terms of the style , the panache , the charisma that they have from within .
913489:37	But it 's too early to get carried away and we must and we always have had our feet on the ground and erm we will do that .
913642:9	Mention must be made of the referee today who had an excellent game , the final score here at the erm High Street Recreation ground ; Milton two , Rayners Lane nil .
913673:38	Although Didcot finished on a high , they in the end , had to give the visitors best in this seven-goal thriller , and will be cursing their luck for the way they made so many errors .
913683:19	Leach , on one occasion had to go full length to save , and also the keeper at the other end too was kept very busy .
913684:67	erm Right on the last few minutes with five minutes to go erm the erm Steven was again through and Leach had to go full length to save .
913697:9	And it must be difficult somewhat for you because since you do get a good side together , then perhaps other clubs come along poaching your players .
913724:9	So you must feel very encouraged the way things are going at present ?
913741:32	The French managed three tries in all , but still had to settle for second place in the five nations championship ; the final score at Twickenham ; twenty one , nineteen .
913778:13	Unfortunately we 've had to make this change because of the new points limit which was imposed on us which has meant that our higher points riders have had to go .
913778:89	Unfortunately we 've had to make this change because of the new points limit which was imposed on us which has meant that our higher points riders have had to go .
913792:96	Well we 've brought the two leagues together and amalgamated them and to do this , obviously the old British League was much stronger than the old National League , and we 've had to do some evening out .
913801:44	erm Every year it does n't normally get in the press but we have to do a deal with all the federations abroad , the Swedes , the Danes , everybody and erm the Danes could n't erm accept what we put to them this year .
913847:60	City will be kicking themselves for allowing Cranfield to get back into the game , but the visitors must be given credit for a spirited second half performance .
913860:86	And then in the third leg of the yankee , the eighth race , this is the nine sixteen , third quarter final erm and here I 'm going to have to go for Ned Supreme in trap one , trained by Kenny Linzell at Romford in Essex .
913864:9	But I must just emphasise erm next Saturday is the real biggie night here at Oxford erm something not to be missed .
913870:81	Welcome to Molyneux , Headley , Brian Horton 's with me , the United manager because he was brought up in this part of the world , must be very proud of what you brought up here for the second half Brian , but so disappointed after that first half showing .
913877:23	Four minutes to go , even you must have thought though , the chance had gone then .
913880:35	Despite the disappointing erm what opening twenty four minutes , you must be pleased with the comeback , and it shows a bit more confidence in that the side can still come back from being three none .
913957:10	We 'll have to put it somewhere
913963:9	, she must try again .
914069:17	You know , you must wonna , you must wanted with it .
914069:28	You know , you must wonna , you must wanted with it .
914143:27	Right , just give me what you have to mark
914155:8	It has to do , it has to be all bits , that 's what that 's all you do .
914155:23	It has to do , it has to be all bits , that 's what that 's all you do .
914300:12	Yeah , she must have shit herself .
914316:7	He must have got a lecture , then .
914356:26	I can get is that , I have to borrow about , be about fifty pound , summat like
914411:10	you just have to get input .
914446:92	Exactly , exactly , so what you 're gonna , you 're gonna keep waiting until , it 's , it 's gonna keep coming out , so you 'll have to buy twelve hundred .
914584:20	And it , you do n't have to keep changing all the paper , you just and it does it .
914763:9	And you have to do
914900:14	And he do n't have to work it out himself
915008:15	So what did you have to do then ?
915009:18	Well , what I had to do , I had to swim under the water
915009:33	Well , what I had to do , I had to swim under the water
915014:17	And , and also you have to get get this dummy
915120:16	The first thing you have to do is take the kettle to the tap and turn the tap on , and then take the kettle back from where you got it and plug it into the plug and , wait for the kettle to boil .
915128:79	Well , really , how to make a cup of tea is like the same thing as making a cup of coffee first you have to take the kettle to the tap , turn the tap on and fill up the kettle , then take the kettle back to the ma , erm , where you got it from and plug it into the wa wall .
915476:14	Erm , all you have to do is dial a phone number that 's .
915574:36	There are three levels of development and you 're gonna have to explain this this morning , so just watch .
915856:13	Cos every country has to make some sort of farming tools , has to make some plates , you know you 've seen photographs and you 've seen pictures , some countries all have some sort of factory .
915856:40	Cos every country has to make some sort of farming tools , has to make some plates , you know you 've seen photographs and you 've seen pictures , some countries all have some sort of factory .
916364:7	You have to think before you speak .
916641:13	He 's always had to find a new friend , he do n't trust me .
916753:34	Yeah , I do n't think yo , you do n't have to go round and buy everybody 's present out of that catalogue .
916848:8	You must get , you must hear that new song it 's really good .
916848:19	You must get , you must hear that new song it 's really good .
916881:12	We do n't have to whisper , they 're not listening .
916959:20	I think we 're gonna have to watch her ?
917010:45	I mean out of the three that he saw and prefer , I must admit he did prefer forty four .
917146:20	The week before that it must have been eleven , twelve .
917168:9	and not have to keep stopping and starting and
917183:90	I was even , you know , obviously you can worry about sending the stuff , this canvass three out purely because the the amount of instructions I had to do last week .
917242:7	I must say that .
917496:12	I 'm gonna have to spread them out anyway and erm it could be a problem .
917518:23	And we 're gonna have , obviously have to avoid the two Sundays from the tour .
917650:73	Now see I 'm looking at this here , right , just for fitting in twelve games I mean , I 'm gonna have to start the first of May .
917652:81	Er , because also yo you really do n't wanna play like three consecutive Sundays , but on some of you these yo we may even have to .
917660:37	I have n't got the things yet , I mean I have to
917713:34	we wanna get decent away matches and not to er have to have too many home games .
917767:45	No I think you ought to take him because then I do n't have to place a man .
917878:10	Well he must have once .
918111:7	Just have to get over it .
918178:23	But and th , and the committee has to guide th , otherwise you 'd still be there !

919441:17	Well she used to have to give some give somebody sixpence which were a lot of money in them days .
919461:26	But when Sam got married he 's had to have a sixpence in .
919462:25	You see he was that always had to be showing off and .
919509:35	And then he said er , Well he said I must

919521:17	He used to mother had to be going living with them .
919557:34	And then Sam said , Oh well me mother will have to come .
919560:9	So they had to come they were la-de-das .

920638:19	Erm no you do n't have to be registered with the council .
920639:58	Er but we shall er we shall say , this is your home address because we shall have to tell the council , but er you 're not here , you 're at Steve 's .
920654:9	So we had to put our address .

920664:98	That 's summat else we 've had to think about not being nasty are we or anything , but as soon as you get married , your marriage certificate 'll have to go for housing .
920742:54	And it does n't matter about anybody else , because the wedding 'll take place and grandad has to sign the register , dad has to sign the register and the mother can sign and that 's all that matters .
920742:77	And it does n't matter about anybody else , because the wedding 'll take place and grandad has to sign the register , dad has to sign the register and the mother can sign and that 's all that matters .
920783:18	she well then you 'll have to carry the mattress downstairs .

920836:17	Yeah but he 'll have to bring somebody ov else over they 're all coming to
920860:41	And then we wer found out instead of sitting and listening we had to do the service .
920940:16	and er I only have to mention the time though , oh dear
920967:15	well you do n't have to go where you give you one
920982:103	I 'm fed up with waiting but out of town , it 's doing me no good all the way round there right round here some , there 's a home , she 'd have to take it
921056:10	you 'll have to take it tomorrow
921085:83	and it refused it , and it should , the woman did n't obviously did n't know what to do , she was as embarrassed as had to get the manager so by this time Brian has packed all his bags up
921088:210	some reason it has n't accepted it and Brian says it 's probably cos me wages have n't gone in yet , the bank they ca n't be empty , so he 's hoping to get that by the time they took it out he 's money at the end , it 's embarrassing enough , so , he 's telling me , so they had to take the stuff off him
921156:51	she got loads , here mother they would n't would they ? , they 'd have to have gold to yours aye
921160:45	told ya years ago to get something in the bank , years ago , have to listen to me when you get on your feet

923690:9	So they had to take the bath completely out

923748:43	Anyway , when he , when he came back again we had to come back cos see we had another delivery of gravel and we ordered three yards and we reckon that on the last journey we bought two yards , we 've got over a yard too much gravel !
923898:21	She went down Wednesday she had to go late because the builder does n't come very early so she did n't go to to B and Q until the afternoon , and she was going around , or Do-it-all , one of them , she was going around looking around and then as soon as she looked out it was half past five !
923904:10	So she had to ride back on the she rode back on the
923919:26	So I said , well , we 'll have to start packing up at half past four because we got cement mixer to clean and all the
923925:7	He had to go and pick somebody up .

924160:9	But you have to give a practical performance .
924195:37	She said that , I said they said , you had to be
924312:23	But I , I wa , I must admit , I was surprised !
924316:10	Well they must see wo , men and women in the same

924517:33	I was a bit annoyed actually cos I even had to wait for him
924521:29	I do n't think he he had to go out or something happened , and I thought , oh blow this for being
924646:44	How many years , it 's only three is n't it before you have to have planning
924655:24	Anyway , as I say , you must be careful because it will run out .
924686:68	You see , but he did n't have a Federation of Buil , Master Builders , but whether , I mean this chap must have quite a few , he did n't say it , but
924753:55	I say , if it was midnight Joey went round with that , I did n't even have to .
