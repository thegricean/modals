34:40	###Yeah . ###And what I , from what I gather the bigger the household that people were in the more they enjoyed it cos the jobs were shared out more . 
41:7	###Yes ? ###at that time and erm , we had a lot of German shutters and cameras in museum before September the third on September the fourth when I got to work they were all out . 
50:84	###To the majority of women , the fact that the famous Parisian fashion houses had closed , that silk stockings and imported luxury goods were more expensive and more difficult to obtain meant very little . ###The major impact was the break up of the family unit . 
58:22	###Well erm this anxiety neurosis erm dominated much of the printed material in women 's magazines . ###erm , you can see in these particularly you can look at them later on . 
63:128	###And there were and erm I hope this is n't too embarrassing for the male members of the audience . ###erm lots of advertisements produced by Tampax , erm about worry and off days and this was because during that time menstruation was one of these taboo subjects that people did n't talk about . 
63:152	###And there were and erm I hope this is n't too embarrassing for the male members of the audience . ###erm lots of advertisements produced by Tampax , erm about worry and off days and this was because during that time menstruation was one of these taboo subjects that people did n't talk about . 
67:64	###And erm Tampax were involved for another reason which I will explain later . ###erm the advertisements themselves called a great caused a great furore because erm Tampax was a fairly new invention and because of the sexual and social mores of the time they were n't considered very nice . 
90:25	###By the end of nineteen forty two , nearly three million married women or widows were so employed . ###Looking cheerful and attractive was no longer a domestic issue but a matter of vital national importance . 
91:12	###Looking cheerful and attractive was no longer a domestic issue but a matter of vital national importance . ###It was a duty and I just have to take this one down . 
96:9	###erm figure precautions by Berlei , manufacturers of corsets . ###And erm fire-fighting but her manicure is perfect Home front hands can still be charming , tangee lipstick for beauty on duty Now foundation garments were considered to be an essential part of the trim active image which it was every woman 's duty to project . 
96:23	###erm figure precautions by Berlei , manufacturers of corsets . ###And erm fire-fighting but her manicure is perfect Home front hands can still be charming , tangee lipstick for beauty on duty Now foundation garments were considered to be an essential part of the trim active image which it was every woman 's duty to project . 
114:77	###Lipstick stubs were mixed with oil or cream to extend their life or to make creme rouge . ###Black boot polish was used instead of mascara , Sore eyes and tired skin refreshed with cucumber skins and of course plenty of raw fruit and vegetables for inner cleanliness . 
118:32	###Advise was given on how to colour the legs with substances such as cold tea , coffee , gravy browning , cocoa powder etcetera with the seams drawn in with pencil , crayon or burnt wood or cork . ###I remember having to do that for my mum . 
122:101	###There it is in a beautiful presentation box . ###As the war progressed beauty products became virtually unobtainable and a healthy mind and body were considered to be more of an asset to the war office , to the war effort , than a pretty face and soft skin . 
136:13	###You referred to the fact of erm , er items that were n't on the , on the rations such as liver . ###Yes ? 
177:9	###Nineteen forty one was the poorest year for food production . ###The nation could no longer support the expense of feeding livestock . 
289:9	###Eight top designers were asked to submit designs for four basic items . ###A coat , suit , winter dress and cotton house-dress . 
321:9	###Can you all see ? ###Yes it was it was a very coarse fabric and if you 'd got animals they te it tended to claw . 
324:7	###And only four colours or combinations of four colours , rust blue green and natural were allowed . ###Good Housekeeping gave advice on home decorating . 
345:48	###Yes . ###It affected the fabric , I did n't know that . 
373:66	###When unpicking a garment the lengths of thread or cotton were saved for mending and tacking . ###And scraps of thick woollen material were knotted into sacking to make split mats or hearth rugs . 
427:19	###In nineteen forty three wooden soled , wedge heeled shoes were introduced in the utility range and the Lady magazine gave hints on how to walk in them . ###If you find yourself walking a bit duck footed , concentrate on placing your toes in a pigeon-toed position and you will find that your muscles will soon cooperate . 
526:8	###And that was n't on rations was it ? ###No , no . 
537:49	###But I think you could you could have whatever you could eat for one and sixpence in the , in the British restaurant . ###Excuse me I 've got not exactly hay-fever but I think I 'm going to be sneezing for a few minutes . 
558:48	###We have used it in anger oh yes . ###It was used in anger because we were living near Sevenoaks when the V one was over the doodlebugs and er they positioned er one of these barrage balloons just near our house you see . 
564:9	###Britain directed more of her resources towards the war effort than any other nation including Germany . ###Recycling of waste was essential and it was the housewives ' job another job for her to salvage from her home such things as paper , bones , tin cans , old gramophone records , photographs and negatives , jam jars , rubber and rags . 
588:60	###and my dad had you know the stuff he used to find in it cutlery all the tea towels and plates and everything else . ###It was , it was used used to be stuff from these restaurants and they were n't particular what they threw in it was all these knives and things 
599:63	###It probably was n't economic in the very small town you know probably you know I do n't , I do n't remember people keeping pigs but if it was collected it probably was collected by the bin at the back door . ###Yeah . 
634:37	###Now the reason that erm they , they were trying to promote the use of tampons was that one could n't get cotton to make cotton wool and so it was n't possible any , any erm er erm sanitary garments that were made of cotton were commandeered and used for people in essential war work or the armed forces . ###And so there was this campaign to persuade women to change . 
642:81	###Then they were to be put in a tin or other suitable container . ###In November nineteen thirty nine , the national savings campaign was set up . 
652:9	###You see there there he is telling this lady do n't listen to her she runs a savings group , the squander bug works for Hitler . ###The squanderbug alias Hitler 's pal , known to be at large in certain parts of the kingdom . 
671:30	###It got right near it , but erm ###Finally there 's just the there 's the famous dig for victory poster and er is your journey really necessary . 
717:37	###Children , erm . ###You might like to look at the erm the West Ham bombing map . 
771:50	###Well thank you for that that 's a very good start to the evening . ###. Thank you . 
783:14	###None but it 's thirty years on . ###I 'm one of the original directors of the theatre and er Mr Chairman what worries me is this . 
783:56	###None but it 's thirty years on . ###I 'm one of the original directors of the theatre and er Mr Chairman what worries me is this . 
836:136	###As soon as our financial situation has eased we 'll certainly employ someone . ###But it is n't true to say I 'd certainly say it is n't true to say that making the recommendations of our market have been slightly up recommendation in takings . 
843:55	###manager should be be a major priority . ###Well that 's what Breeze am keep telling me when I got to work in the morning it 's about the time of recession people should advertise more not less that maybe but the hard financial situation of the theatre finds itself in is to find that sort of money is very difficult at the moment . 
887:78	###Yeah . ###And one of one of the things that I 've got on a regular basis is the many of the things Harlow Council put on like pop concerts country and western have actually been used by people who who perhaps live outside of Harlow so the Council are now looking at a charging policy but also we should also gonna introduce into the theatre is the leisure card which actually includes that the people actually live in the town local and the reproductional sort of show if they can do so they should buy . 
940:52	###Right right right well we we 'll we 'll look at that quite clearly . ###One I mean one of the reason 's that we 've actually changed these round and and do n't think it 's right is because the has a there 's been a cut cut cost cutting exercise within the building . 
943:112	###I mean when you 're looking for seventy thousand pounds savings you can only do two things . ###You can either look at people 's jobs because that 's the bulk of the money goes or you look at the charging policy or you look how the building 's run . 
1022:15	###Is this a public consultation meeting ? ###The meeting this evening is to get the public 's views and how best to plan it 's progress 
1024:15	###Why does a view have to be expressed as a question ? ###Sorry ? 
1027:65	###Hm hm . . ###Chair Ian . 
1061:90	###Yes . ###The point 's that I think is trying to be made is that there are a lot of people here tonight who do wish to express an opinion and that opinion is not necessarily formulated in question form . 
1100:33	###In the studio . ###One of the reasons why to save money is because the studio theatre has a limited capacity . 
1101:35	###One of the reasons why to save money is because the studio theatre has a limited capacity . ###And the sort of er money that wo n't have to pay a reputable alternative theatre it was such that one could n't hope to break even on that capacity with the sort of seat prices that were that we 're charging . 
1104:191	###I know there are people here ###I know there are people here in the audience that use used to come to classical music concerts , horrendously expensive even with the Eastern orchestral board 's subsidy . 
1104:239	###I know there are people here ###I know there are people here in the audience that use used to come to classical music concerts , horrendously expensive even with the Eastern orchestral board 's subsidy . 
1104:257	###I know there are people here ###I know there are people here in the audience that use used to come to classical music concerts , horrendously expensive even with the Eastern orchestral board 's subsidy . 
1156:91	###Right I mean these are area 's in in this entertainments centre as it was called earlier on the entertainment being theatre and the gallery erm that may be utilised more i.e. jazz bands in the downstairs bar erm any other ideas I mean get people into the building then you 'll sell tickets to keep the place running . ###I mean I I certainly accept that I mean I think there a lot of problems on the in the stage door club several nights of the years . 
1255:99	###We have er demand for tours of the theatre schools in the area which were not able to meet . ###It seems an ideal . 
1296:54	###I I I was certainly with that question has been recorded and I I ca n't answer immediately but obviously you you what you 've said we 'll take that up with the management committee and come back to you straight away . ###Okay . 
1370:7	###erm we actually find it quite hard to book our seats . ###If you pick up the phone and ring to get seats here you will very often find that you ca n't get through . 
1423:63	###Money is tight so we need to be quite clear on I mean for instance I mean the seats have been recovered you know people smoking in the seats when they should n't be smoking and putting they 're putting their cigarette 's out on the floor I do n't know ###Oh yeah but were not talking about . 
1423:85	###Money is tight so we need to be quite clear on I mean for instance I mean the seats have been recovered you know people smoking in the seats when they should n't be smoking and putting they 're putting their cigarette 's out on the floor I do n't know ###Oh yeah but were not talking about . 
1423:105	###Money is tight so we need to be quite clear on I mean for instance I mean the seats have been recovered you know people smoking in the seats when they should n't be smoking and putting they 're putting their cigarette 's out on the floor I do n't know ###Oh yeah but were not talking about . 
1427:171	###The whole carpeting of the building which has been done was that the consultants come in look at colour schemes and say this is what to do . ###So yes the answer to the question is yes there is a budget there is a budget and we need to do things now one of the problems could be the budget is n't sufficient to cover all that needs doing so I think you 'll find that the building been built at a certain time there a comes a time you 've got plan a maintenance programme which we have things need to be done . 
1503:18	###No , I bet . ###She 'll be in the penny farthing then . 
1562:79	###Yeah , we 'd , we 'd like to hear about it cos were all very worried , huh . ###Well on the issue of what 's happening in the er Health Authority here , it 's a very much erm a surprise to everybody because those of us who were at the last meeting that we had , only a couple of months ago , to quite categorically saying that , she , that she was just not interested in the . 
1585:21	###Only five of us . ###But eh . 
1585:46	###Only five of us . ###But eh . 
1623:15	###Pauline . ###Yeah . 
1648:20	###Well I think we can arrange to pick you up as we go at that time , you 'll of eh , because I know that bus passes do n't cover that . ###Dave driving is he ? 
1688:7	###I phoned him yesterday , and er , I ask him whether it was right that er what I suspected , that the er vets , the private vets , there with a union , you will not get the R S P C A , they work on there on behalf . ###They beg you . 
1689:47	###They beg you . ###They have to erm , first of all ask er R S P C A funding it , which is very much against anyway because I , I hate being humiliated by the this way . 
1730:10	###From the way this lady spoke it seems to me like , like a that , that sort of er organisation , from the establishment . ###Another things is . 
1733:15	###Just say we go ahead with the decision . ###Yeah , yeah . 
1733:75	###Just say we go ahead with the decision . ###Yeah , yeah . 
1879:72	###And while were doing that , we should thank Mary for her seven years stint that she 's done on . ###Yeah . 
2033:32	###Oh . ###In fact you know about it ahead of most Council staff I would say . 
2110:10	###It 's different to what I 've heard , very few I 've met have . ###That , that 's been the only other way of doing it . . 
2299:33	###I do n't . ###You put it in the bin . 
2424:11	###in our recycling directory and we can do the next one ###He should know about them should n't he ? 
2424:29	###in our recycling directory and we can do the next one ###He should know about them should n't he ? 
2434:9	###recycling in in Egypt . ###And I just liked reading it so much that I thought you 'd like to read it too . 
2441:23	###Now they are flooded with the West European goods their recycling is n't worth any more . ###On the other hand they have n't got the landfills and the whole scheme that the west has developed and they I mean it 's a health hazard meanwhile . 
2461:82	###They could do something about that . ###Have you every cycled up there ? 
2648:24	###I noticed they had some Philippine mahogany doors in Do It All ###Mm . 
2658:81	###Erm oh ###Yes actually this cycle thing . 
2675:7	###Yeah they squeeze you off the road if you go up that hill to Hockerill lights . ###I 
2680:31	###That 's the only way . ###Our cat , and I 've really watched her makes a point of going and walking slowly in the road . 
2688:40	###That is their fault if they hoot . ###Erm especially going up that hill at Hockerill lights . 
2703:25	###make them like swimming hats with lots of little flowers all over them ###Yeah . 
2756:9	###Oh they 're usually okay I , I mean what they do n't know . ###I mean I just find it annoying cos you get through to somebody who then passes you on to somebody else and then they 'll talk to you and say well the person you want to talk to is n't here at the moment so you 've had all this phone call and then you 've got to ring again . 
2797:72	###Herts county council . ###Cos when I was on the Hertfordshire Environmental of the group which has folded 
2799:10	###I 've got all this money in the Abbey National and there 's no , no group any more , I think I 'll have to keep ###Keep quiet . 
2801:22	###I 'll have to send it off to . ###But anyway it transpired that there were two groups sort of working towards the same end and nobody could work out what sort of erm role each played and it was terrible . 
2869:58	###Well I do n't , I have never heard of a local group that makes money out of this selling . ###Well you you buy it all at thirty three or twenty five percent discount so you can then sell it at a bit more . 
2890:88	###Well that 's the recession is n't it ? ###Or 
2954:15	###Yeah . ###Erm 
3023:34	###What , what you can do is you can then get basically you get the computer to type that out type that out . ###Ah . 
3155:62	###Well who runs what ? ###The swimming pool 
3155:82	###Well who runs what ? ###The swimming pool 
3157:15	###Because I know the scouts do the Tesco one and whenever they are put in these cardboard boxes they have to be sorted so somebody must sort them . ###Oh they 're not , they 're not asking sorting , oh I see . 
3158:13	###Oh they 're not , they 're not asking sorting , oh I see . ###Erm so there must be somebody responsible and I think if , if we write swimming pool and people take their cans there 
3173:9	###it 's it 's strange you can give that as an address . ###Any Uttlesford town of some size has got a comprehensive recycling centre now that takes any paper 
3174:9	###Any Uttlesford town of some size has got a comprehensive recycling centre now that takes any paper ###Do you have to sort it ? 
3187:32	###Mm . ###Or whether they actually get the disposals cost incorporated into this skip collecting cost . 
3251:7	###If I see them collecting I 'll ask . ###And then if you 're collating 
3261:25	###Oh right . ###Charity shops . 
3309:9	###Think you were reading them upside down ! ###Well they only , they only er took the batteries over to me before we left on holiday . 
3326:7	###You are fined you are heavily fined in Germany and for decades already . ###You were not allowed to wash your car on a normal street because oil would automatically be flushed into into the guttering , into the 
3326:31	###You are fined you are heavily fined in Germany and for decades already . ###You were not allowed to wash your car on a normal street because oil would automatically be flushed into into the guttering , into the 
3336:35	###Yeah . ###but there is n't now is there it just comes splashing out . 
3346:12	###I think they were being most unreasonable . ###We at the time the attendant said it was alright . 
3390:7	###Who does all the schools ? ###As to recycling . 
3421:31	###They did n't but then they had ###as well ? 
3423:7	###Well , they wo n't because they they they have to make money in order to survive . ###The more money they make the better for them . 
3454:26	###Are Red Cross still taking furniture in Stortford ? ###Now where is Red Cross ? 
3629:10	###No sorry . ###Council 's environment advisory committee . 
3629:20	###No sorry . ###Council 's environment advisory committee . 
3756:9	###I think if some cakes we need definitely . ###Oh . 
4002:14	###Nothing . ###He said he he 's apparently just moved and he 's got involved with this other charity erm to do with the United Nations Friends of the Earth and just passed it on to me . 
4032:36	###I well really I do n't think you should say you 're not doing enough ! ###No 
4072:7	###to write again and again you know And you never get a positive answer , clear answer first , first time round do you ? ###Mm . 
4121:7	###This looks really interesting . ###get it . 
4199:7	###You see they refer everybody on and then I ###Well but they should give her a soli , the name of a solicitor . 
4200:7	###Well but they should give her a soli , the name of a solicitor . ###There must be green solicitors about . 
4303:11	###I mean I have been into this window frame business . ###Mm 
4339:15	###Thank you very much . ###Yes . 
4339:75	###Thank you very much . ###Yes . 
4383:13	###Right erm , so were happy with the , with the minutes otherwise , alright I 'll , I 'll sign them , er ###Eleventh . 
4431:77	###Right , okay , the other thing I was going to ask about we , we had a big promotion of Amnesty by The Body Shop , last year , er and we noticed that Our Price were also going to do promotion of Amnesty and we asked , wonder if we look into local shops and see what they could find out and what was going on , did you find anything ? ###Yeah , I , I went in yesterday actually , I spoke to the assistant manager and erm , it , it was not good news at all , he got two like plastic dispensers of leaflets in front of the till 
4466:24	###Right , well we have two hundred and sixty five pounds and sixty eight pence in the bank at the moment , erm which actually is n't very much if you think that we 've got to go right through to July to our next fund raising event , so , I was wondering that , if anyone has n't paid their subscriptions for last year or if anyone owes for Christmas cards , I think there 's one or two ###How much is the subscription ? 
4499:24	###Mm . ###That was earlier on . 
4504:171	###Right , now erm , the next item is the prisoner , but we actually do n't have a prisoner at the moment do we , because our , we have , we eat , every Amn each Amnesty Group has er usually nowadays one er given to look after and our most recent prisoner was er Sabri Lushe , is that the right one ? ###Yes . 
4650:28	###Well , I mean , hopefully there , there 'd be at least er sort of thing erm in the summery to see what went on during the year ###Mm , mm . 
4912:31	###We 'll make it . ###I do n't think she was in no . 
4956:17	###Mm , mm , right and are we , I mean if anybody still wanted to put in a motion , there is still time just about . ###Yeah about , just about , yeah . 
5097:214	###erm , I think what those post were , were erm elected and then the ###Means we 've got to produce . 
5172:45	###Right , Ann , you gonna start ? ###Well , this , I told you about this French boy that phoned , that contacted me , he 's erm , my name is , I 'm nineteen , I 'm a student at Harlow College , I 'm studying English foreign language and Law A Level , if there 's an Amnesty International I would like to set up a group in the college I hope you 're involved in local groups are writing you to receive about me , and information about the local group . 
5357:9	###it was about death penalty was n't it ? ###there 's all sorts like , like recruiting , making contact with the schools , er , lobbying , er , there , there about ten or twelve different workshops now , almost on almost every aspects , so and that would be something that we could give , if , if these were n't . 
5418:20	###Erm it consisted of the ambassadors of the great , of the , of of the great powers erm er meeting together at St Petersburg . ###Erm it 's there 's a certain irony about all this . 
5639:52	###If the price of bringing about your united state is the dumping of liberals , then so be it . ###In that sense nationalism of course er it perhaps becomes a more dynamic and problematic ideology in nineteenth century Europe . 
5920:28	###I 'm sorry that I was unable to get , well two things went wrong first of all the date of the exhibition 's changed Gaugin and his friends in Brittany , due to circumstances beyond our control . ###But in this programme you 'll appreciate this planned months , its planned , when did I first contact you ? , oh February was n't it , right , so we thought we 'd have pictures here and Sue would be talking in front of the pictures . 
5934:65	###Well I think I 'll start off by telling you a little bit about myself erm , I 'm a writer and I live in Durham , my work is here and I 've also work abroad , if anybody ca n't hear me please say ###No

6145:28	###Some of you are . ###Well I 've got some stories that I 'd like to share with you but there 's a condition . 
6156:17	###No . ###You took your clothes off for it . 
6187:47	###But Manyara , when she was alone with her sister Nyasha , was not always very nice to her . ###She bullied her . 
6201:16	###She grew yams she grew millet she grew vegetables and sunflowers and the food she shared with all the family . ###And one day when she was working in her little garden slithering between the vine yams there came a green snake . 
6220:22	###Father she said , please do n't send Nyasha . ###She would be so lonely to be without you . 
6224:50	###And then you will have Nyasha to look after you . ###My child , said Mufaro her father , that is very kind of you but the king is the person who is going to choose . 
6226:73	###He is the one who 'll decide who is most worthy , so you must both go . ###And that is what was decided upon . 
6278:7	###Called someone . ###Here is her footprint on the path leading towards the city . 
6279:7	###Here is her footprint on the path leading towards the city . ###She must have left already said Mufaro . 
6298:10	###Oh father she said , this is so beautiful . ###I 've never seen such a beautiful country in my life . 
6312:7	###It 's telling you all about . ###Nyasha said do n't worry my sister . 
6313:35	###Nyasha said do n't worry my sister . ###We must not be afraid . 
6532:57	###Are you asleep ? ###Oh dear . 
6543:70	###I do n't know when this story started but it certainly happened a long time ago . ###It was n't in your time , and it was n't in my time . 
6551:90	###Oh my goodness she said , I ca n't help you there . ###You 'll need to go and get some advice from the head wife at the end of the village . 
6672:20	###I 'd like to ###You 'd like to help the animals ? 
6755:7	###Please , she said that 's my skin there . ###Let me have it back .

6762:8	###Please , please come and live with me . ###Please come and be my wife . 
6765:35	###That 's where I live . ###But Angus had hold of the skin . 
6783:14	###Never forget me my dear she said . ###I will always help you in your future life . 
6783:34	###Never forget me my dear she said . ###I will always help you in your future life .

7085:58	###We just want to say thank you very much to all of you for coming and listening . ###But there 's one thing that you have to remember . 
7174:7	###so we 're here to ###scrap through the remains of erm and got the wire wool and got them down and washed them , what I would like today if you would be so kind as to assist when you 've finished your pottery is to re-label these , now some of you er , have already finished pottery and start straight away , those who only have the finishing touches to do , start half way through the lesson or whatever , but I do intend to give a demonstration now , so , could you gather all round 
7214:57	###nearly all metals have oxides and those powderless substances on the surface of the ###which is scraped off and used as so called paint for the pottery , mixed with a little light 
7282:63	###J A Y N ###Yeah . 
7286:7	###Do you know what I mean ? ###Then it 'll fit on very easily . 
7361:63	###The actual etching process where the acid bites through the liner into the metal and makes a rule . ###When that 's happened I 'll take it out of the acid clean it and show you how to take a print from the plate . 
7372:10	###Please . ###Now we 're gonna be using acid very very dilute acid . 
7409:7	###Right , my friends we 've very strange and wonderful chemicals in this erm I do beg your pardon when we are printing . ###The one which you will have come across when we were doing lino printing was turps . 
7463:7	###A s sort of cupboard . ###It 's open at the front . 
7463:24	###A s sort of cupboard . ###It 's open at the front . 
7468:12	###This has n't been used for some time so it 's a bit so I 'm just going to wipe it out so there are no particles or foreign bodies in there . ###And this bit I do before the lesson and I do this , clean it up afterwards . 
7535:20	###And there may only have been one clock in the town where they worked and that would have been on the town hall or the church . ###Clocks are a very recent er introduction as far as ordinary er working conditions are concerned . 
7561:7	###Right , my face will start falling off . ###Quite right . 
7637:7	###It 's a little sort of er science fiction monster . ###Now the turps will not I think dissolve this varnish because this varnish is alcohol based varnish . 
7654:15	###What would the other substance be ? ###Water . 
7654:48	###What would the other substance be ? ###Water . 
7656:55	###Erm it would have to be if it were with water I 'd have to put something else in as well otherwise the stuff would n't stay on the page . ###It would just fall off like a dust . 
7663:10	###Glue ? ###Glue , yes . 
7682:12	###I 'm going to take a , a roller these are very expensive , very classy rollers . ###Much higher quality than the bioprinting rollers that we may be used to using . 
7749:7	###Excuse me for a moment . ###Right , this process that I 'm about to do should take place on that table there , normally . 
7794:26	###So you put it under both like this . ###Thanks for mentioning that . 
7800:9	###the wrong way round is n't it ? ###All printing is . 
7800:57	###the wrong way round is n't it ? ###All printing is . 
7842:30	###I will I I will say to Kevin yeah ? ###Take a print , see if you can do it . 
7844:12	###But , remember these are wet so you have to leave them out , flat to dry . ###And then of course we sign them up later . 
7845:7	###And then of course we sign them up later . ###And I 'll have to teach you precisely how to sign them up . 
7846:48	###And I 'll have to teach you precisely how to sign them up . ###You must also learn how to clean up after yourselves . 
7854:7	###Yes . ###Then you would erm do it again with a clean one so that this ended up looking as clean as that . 
7862:12	###Thank you for your attention . ###If you 'd like to go into the next room , please . 
7885:7	###and are translated into a work for academic and study for the purpose of general knowledge about the English language . ###Erm I took the liberty of saying yes to Maureen to come along and record the language debate . 
7915:15	###It 's running now . ###Thank you . 
7918:12	###You want a selection of things and ###We 'll just pull out 
7972:10	###And it 's wonderfully , wonderfully romantic and I think therefore may suit er the board and guests of Northern Rock er very well . ###Er and hopefully I can attract them to that . 
8016:100	###I I er yes . ###In in that connection I think perhaps what we could usefully say 
8074:114	###What did you decide ? ###Well , I decided really , or we decided I suppose to er link it to the festival . 
8077:40	###I certainly do n't think with the sort of product we have at the moment that there will be any possibility of raising prices before then because I mean , you know , there just are n't any really films which are going to grab people . ###Er but at the festival it is an appropriate moment . 
8077:66	###I certainly do n't think with the sort of product we have at the moment that there will be any possibility of raising prices before then because I mean , you know , there just are n't any really films which are going to grab people . ###Er but at the festival it is an appropriate moment . 
8135:33	###Erm and any of these things could of course be brought to a meeting to be referred to . ###Erm the thing which we keep daily is number six , is it ? 
8142:188	###It then erm is made up into this chart by somebody . ###I would like if possible not to do that any more , cos clearly that is just a duplication of material already elsewhere available . 
8143:32	###I would like if possible not to do that any more , cos clearly that is just a duplication of material already elsewhere available . ###And if it were possible for you to decide that one of these options , one to eight , were to suit your regular and usual purposes at these meetings for general discussion then that obviously would be both a saving in erm time and labour and is one of the reasons why one installs computerized equipment so that you do n't er then have to do it all manually as well . 
8156:23	###And I would , I would , I would erm give the minimum and preferably use your own references . ###I think if you were to use another sheet altogether it would be for me at least unnecessary work . 
8173:13	###Now is there a connection or is n't there a connection ? ###The other thing that concerned me was particular slots which do n't seem to ever produce much in the way of attendance or revenue . 
8225:9	###It might be say at equal opportunities which we 've worked at a very great deal over the last year . ###Clearly you ca n't expect admissions of people with disabilities er for example , taking one aspect of that er cultural and er that policy , to be high if you know the building itself is physically inaccessible . 
8285:49	###And whether it varies or whether it 's consistent . ###Whether a particular pattern 's in there . 
8380:16	###At the box office , this is . ###Yeah . 
8429:71	###And we take into account what we know about product up coming which is n't always a lot . ###Erm and so forth . 
8522:71	###Well it was n't , I mean this is an example , sorry . ###Oh right . 
8522:95	###Well it was n't , I mean this is an example , sorry . ###Oh right . 
8535:15	###Mm . ###over a weekend . 
8576:15	###So erm I I , I mean I can understand that we have a a specific need to er address the member of who signs what cheques but I think the matter of cash is covered by two , the chief executive is answerable to a board for financial matters . ###These are monitored by the board 's scrutiny of the monthly management accounts . 
8580:7	###somebody . ###Well that 's cash out . 
8705:10	###Erm er in my opinion they are a very good tenant and a very good person to work with and they certainly are very cooperative with the cinema . ###Erm I could of course and will of course erm take advice as to whether the rent we 're now charging them is reasonable . 
8721:20	###It is not necessarily the always I think that the type of operation which a certain sector of our audience would necessarily want . ###I E it does n't always serve the food which they would like . 
8731:58	###come in the middle of the day or whenever you know they 'll be busy . ###It 's amazing . 
8779:20	###And he could say right , you want a mea right ###Well , stuffed baked potatoes . 
8806:87	###And I think the quality , and that is one of the quality of service , quality of er route of complaints and so on . ###I would like to see those things built in . 
8843:17	###but if he 's not willing to pay a market rent . ###Mm . 
8959:7	###You just insist you have access to the books at any time or you send your accountant in to check . ###I wondered if there was a 
8960:27	###I wondered if there was a ###Everything has to have a till receipt . 
9019:102	###Er the university of Northumbria or Newcastle ###Is that Newcastle brackets Carlisle campus . 
9159:15	###It 's not you see because every person ###Have to check it with everybody 
9170:12	###already got tied up ###Yes , that 's right 
9295:5	###because the coordinator are the ones who know if they ###what 's 
9350:47	###That 's right ###because you 're blind Iris I 've got to say because 
9393:17	###because we have , because it 's for the children , so I said we 'll do it , but that gives us an awful crush to get it in Friday the first week ###Exactly , and also it 's 
9467:34	###erm and you know and that would be their kind of bible get one with a lock on ###Yeah 
9525:139	###erm , moving on , erm audio description in Scotland , no er since this , the last meeting , yes Cath and I have been talking about all that money , we had an entertaining day out ###Entertaining day out 
9596:61	###so and UFAF , UFAF is , is a , in fact UFAF I felt quite pleased about in a way because we 'd , we 'd analyzed Maggie and I had analyzed the documents and Jane and I and Graham and I had spoken about it as well , that they are principally interested in unemployed volunteers ###Mhm 
9633:17	###there 'd be a not quite a specialist application to Carniki , Carniki will be linked to UFAF ###Mhm 
9652:31	###saying you know , we need a sum of money and Mary will help me with the marketing of that and hopefully after that we would , go on enough to keep us going , so hopefully by the time Christmas comes ###Mhm 
9665:39	###Yes decisions , no , no , no for the actual post of ###all that stuff I appreciate that , but the actual raising of money and something 
9763:4	###Yes , yes ###I mean I could n't care less , as long as it was something 
9789:22	###and I know that 's a bit blind and , and I 'm usually ###Well 
9850:74	###It 's expensive ###Yeah , exactly 
9889:65	###through to Glasgow she was Rose that she lecturers and dramas or something ###Margaret 
9899:86	###Let me just put you in the picture there Brian , what , what Lorne has agreed subject to what guarantees have been given ###Mhm 
9910:224	###I mean you 'd asked him to do that ###I mean he 's , he has been quite busy 
9923:9	###hands , erm , I mean he 's , he 's really genuinely concerned , wanting to help us , but I mean he 's obviously he 's , you know , he is the union ###Oh yes , absolutely he 's quite right about that 
9923:77	###hands , erm , I mean he 's , he 's really genuinely concerned , wanting to help us , but I mean he 's obviously he 's , you know , he is the union ###Oh yes , absolutely he 's quite right about that 
9924:5	###Oh yes , absolutely he 's quite right about that ###and he has to represent his neighbours , erm so erm so we would need to guar give guarantees , I think that would have to be 
9926:29	###have to give guarantees that the tape would not be abused , but I mean that in , in , in actuality you know , if it was you doing the training ###That 's right 
9945:18	###No I ca n't and can I tell you , I 'm not being funny but I think that 's actually maybe quite important , I know this is not the in doubt visually impaired people but ###Oh no 
9968:16	###similar ###Yes there 's a technique for , for raising it , is n't it ? 
10188:107	###and linked to that I was going to do a new information sheet , I found the old information sheet so I just bring that up to date ###Mhm 
10215:12	###Yeah I 'm not sure if it mentions the magic words ###Regional Council , but 
10238:133	###I heard that ###They were , they were videoing for this 
10443:16	###Yeah ###Oh yes 
10444:39	###Oh yes ###Well what we might have to do is concoct something up on a letter , a stand have you a standard charge ? 
10566:15	###but it meant people could go up to the box office and take a tape recorder and sit and listen to them ###Right 
10570:51	###Morag does it , Morag does it for them anyway ###Yes , so it 's quite good to have that kind of thing to publicize . 
10740:41	###tapes ###Tapes 
10819:42	###I just thought maybe , you know , sort of miss them out do level one . ###Do another type ? 
10953:12	###No ###that 's 
11150:19	###now now basically what we 're thinking is that no , we 're not thinking , we have n't really got round to that ! ###But I I would feel that that 
11243:7	###Yes . ###for the other one so I know ! 
11264:7	###If it was just in brackets then I ignored it ###Yeah . 
11304:20	###The on , the only , the only ###Oh right ! 
11532:44	###cos if we 're reporting , we 're not assessing . ###Mhm . 
11610:4	###But , yes , I agree we need something like that . ###But the big problem at present is that that form tutors get loads of information sent to them and then they 
11660:26	###anything like that . ###But but , you should also be be sure that the form tutor pro can clarify things for parents because although , no no matter how hard you try to make this erm , a clear and easily understandable document it 's only clear and un easily understandable to us . 
11713:121	###I I 'm er ah I like to think that the youngsters have actually got some input into the report , I think it 's important ###Yes , I 'm not saying deny that 
11718:52	###Yeah . ###Mm . 
11776:12	###is that , but you ###Has it ? 
11778:10	###but you do have to remember as I say ###I 've got one I 'll give you my book later on Angela ! 
11825:12	###Alright , I ###should be 
11827:12	###I do n't have to look , if I can just ###It 's all mechanistic to say that ! 
11832:14	###mechanistic ###Oh yes I feel oh stop ! 
11880:9	###Comments . ###That 's what 
11884:11	###Okay . ###Yes , that will . 
12118:206	###bottom of these reports why ca n't you make it into a a pu er er a a joint teacher pupil comment , it is n't just a , it is n't in the same form it 's just the same that the pupil writes that with guidance ###with teacher guidance , sitting next to the teacher . 
12119:80	###with teacher guidance , sitting next to the teacher . ###I think we 're losing track of what this actually is Paul , there are , you 're trying to do two things at once what you 're trying to do , I think is use it as a learning process for children but this is an annual report for parents and I think that part of it a at least surely must be a report by the sa member of staff , by the department on how the child has done , by the member staff . 
12166:63	###we have a ###Differentiation . 
12172:20	###discretion or it is hoped that pupils would be afforded the opportunity to make their own , if ###Involved in the process . 
12243:10	###Yes . ###and we had all this we 've got 
12330:4	###Well once a year but they never ###Yeah . 
12367:69	###Mhm . ###Course outline national curriculum levels , staff comment . 
12388:18	###Yeah . ###And the first part of it that would be staff comments . 
12510:37	###Okay . ###without you know , having to 
12515:7	###Oh yes we are are n't we ? ###Yes . 
12521:17	###and involve the child . ###as to whether it 's a joint 
12521:28	###and involve the child . ###as to whether it 's a joint 
12525:4	###I think you should write that down okay , that means pupils ###Well 
12544:69	###Mm . ###Yes , but there is still the the the thought that a me , I 'm sorry ! 
12549:22	###You know , I mean , I might be saying Jimmy has wasted his time this year ###Oh yeah ! 
12551:30	###then he will have under me have to say , Jimmy does not agree with this ###Yes . 
12637:46	###it 's my belief but there are beliefs , I mean it does behove you to present ###Yes ! 
12637:119	###it 's my belief but there are beliefs , I mean it does behove you to present ###Yes ! 
12638:38	###Yes ! ###what other departments feel to your to your people , because wha , you do have to be careful about the indoctrination , this is what I believe so it 's right , we 've gotta we do have to strike a balance . 
12641:12	###I think a , that there 's another point that we should all remember and that is that it should n't just be our opinion either , we are sort of told from high certain things ###By who ? 
12641:52	###I think a , that there 's another point that we should all remember and that is that it should n't just be our opinion either , we are sort of told from high certain things ###By who ? 
12672:9	###See this , this bit here this , the whole presentation this this part of it here ###Mhm . 
12890:39	###September or sorry , in July or ###Mm . 
13136:13	###Ability to actually do something rather than just copy something to follow instructions means they 've got to actually do a ste step-wise thing . ###Right ? 
13155:7	###Yes , active right , okay . ###Involvement . 
13236:53	###Angela I seem to rem ###The wrong one . 
13247:118	###With all due respect is tha is that re is that relevant ? ###No , hang on here misrepresenting what I 'm saying there . 
13326:34	###I think Angela 's saying exactly the same ###I 'm trying to take an over-view . 
13329:30	###Mhm . ###with all due respect . 
13332:15	###No . ###No , but the ar , the previous argument was whether there would be an un sa understanding of it , we wo n't understand literacy . 
13393:24	###I I I think ###Absolutely ! 
13495:18	###appropriate ###with all due respect we will meet that 
13589:144	###Sorry ? ###Hardly . 
13683:12	###What about listening skills and and speaking skills ? ###Well hang on , social skills . 
13698:18	###I think that we should be aware of what these levels ###mean . 
13698:43	###I think that we should be aware of what these levels ###mean . 
13831:13	###D' you see ? ###like problem solving . 
13835:10	###go bu ###do some then ! 
13868:4	###We we would ###Yeah . 
13868:115	###We we would ###Yeah . 
13884:7	###Yes , the the the all these ###Oh I did n't know that . 
13885:33	###Oh I did n't know that . ###have have to be at that 's why it 's a ten point scale 
13892:17	###Oh no ! ###No no ! 
13895:48	###I 'm not saying ###apply that 
14101:15	###I 'm not sure Andrew . ###Erm 
14105:33	###Well , possibly . ###But what about the current situation ? 
14174:94	###Yeah ! ###I mean we were 
14318:34	###Good . ###very 
14319:18	###very ###Well I think what we 'll , she 'll have to do 
14345:21	###Would you be having that at County Hall ? ###Yes . 
14438:20	###Say four or five people come to that meeting ###Mm 
14503:52	###Well only for the tutor to come in with his er overhead projector or whatever he 's got . ###I 'll try and get time for that . 
14563:28	###I mean it , we may find yet , we do n't know we have n't applied , we , cos the reason that we have n't applied cos we did n't know until today exactly who we were going to invite and when we were going to hold it er so it would be ludicrous to apply for time off when you did n't even know the date you were holding it and who you were going to invite . ###Erm so , and we will do that now but I mean it may transpire that the employer might say no to paid time off er for the people who are on days as , as well as 
14603:11	###I , I s I ca n't , I ca n't make that decision . ###Oh . 
14603:26	###I , I s I ca n't , I ca n't make that decision . ###Oh . 
14603:44	###I , I s I ca n't , I ca n't make that decision . ###Oh . 
14634:144	###It 's , I mean they 're , okay you 're applying from three different standpoints but it 's coming out of one well budgetholder 's erm kitty . ###I think , you know , you say you 've got a month , I think you 're gonna need also to try and find out from your membership as to whether in fact they 're prepared to turn up on a Saturday as well . 
14692:77	###Cos we , we will get it , we know we will cos it 's an agreement you see . ###Your only problem it seems is erm you 're not sure whether you 're gonna get paid or time off or not . 
14752:18	###Er this week . ###Tentatively . 
14801:51	###Well it could , it could be ###either the ninth or the tenth , it could be held here it could be held at Havstock Park . 
14818:9	###Mm . ###Right 
14820:9	###Does it have to be in ? ###Mm ? 
14991:47	###Not a lot , but one or two things direct from national level . ###Er but as I say if , if we can do it on a personalized basis er personalized geographic basis , it gives it more identity er then what , what you produced certainly i is halfway there to the issues that Steve mentioned earlier on . 
15016:55	###And that 's the way to look at it , that 's the way to put it to them . ###And to the normal layman that sounds better than not say nothing at all . 
15044:15	###This is gonna be the hard part , to get it ###You see you 're you 're all talking about contributions in or an ability to pay but based on what ? 
15076:23	###You s you see you cannot deal with rough ###pending discussions but the whole thing Mr chairman really has n't erm has n't been decided to you know er a few colleagues point er I mean there 's nothing we can actually start and you can put pencil to paper on at the present time . 
15239:9	###Right , the people who have not read an essay out yet , I want you to sit , just a minute Michael , next to somebody and I want you to read your essay to them and see what they think about it and how you could maybe improve it and I want Michael and John to go and show Steve your books as well now please , right boys do that now then , yes , could you take yours to show ###please 
15251:22	###and that is n't ###essay , either work your book or , and get it 
15374:60	###what do you think it means ? ###Now take it sentence by sentence , what about the first one ? 
15427:55	###they were the ones that organized the mini markets , run the ###town , they , they would have a minimal allowance of vegetables or meat or whatever to sell , it was the women that did the bartering , it was the women that actually got enough money to feed the family and , and the men were really quite an

15469:124	###Adrian what 's , what 's your comments , serious comments on that ? ###I do n't know , on what ? 
15527:12	###Er , I 'll certainly pull a few changes and ###yes

15966:7	###Your passports and your graphs . ###There the two big pieces of work that we 've done together so far , in a minute I 'm going to give you a printed sheet

16490:7	###Good . ###What 's a division ? 
16508:26	###Oh agents exist in different forms really , erm I 'm gonna be , we 'll be mentioning the notion of political agents in central government later er in , in , in ce in general elections later on . ###Erm but there is a similarity in both er elections yeah . 
16510:9	###Anyone standing for election at local government level has to have an election agent . ###However you can be your own agent . 
16510:32	###Anyone standing for election at local government level has to have an election agent . ###However you can be your own agent . 
16528:94	###All you really know about general , about the general election is that it 's gotta be held before the end of parliament 's statutory life of five years . ###Yeah ? 
16531:13	###Yeah ? ###And John Major chose to er erm call the election , dissolve , ask for the dissolution of parliament last year and the election took place in er in , in April . 
16540:37	###No . ###However it just so happens the last time an election was n't on a Thursday was in er I think it was nineteen thirty one when it was held on a Tuesday . 
16549:12	###It 's just one of these common That 's general elections we 're talking about by the way . ###We 've slightly digressed but I take your , I take your point . 
16670:127	###The advice was was not to hang on and see what the May elections er looked like . ###Couple of reasons , one was on a much smaller sample yeah ?

16739:9	###Again I 've forgotten the entire erm it 's not easy , er th the rather complicated rigmarole about this erm er the great man comes to my rescue as usual Burn . ###He says a local authority can apply to change the electoral system at any time I E a district council but not more than once every ten years . 
16802:13	###It 's , it 's not , perhaps it 's no accident er maybe those or other factors that you do tend the lowest turn outs in metropolitan districts the big city districts . ###And there 's a not inconsiderable point as well that exp it 's expensive . 
17065:12	###It 's all beyond me at the moment as well ! ###Right , so , if I just start on isomers across the board . 
17067:22	###Now , you must remember , in the link sheet make sure you back up whatever you 're getting here . ###Make sure you back it up with the exercises . 
17073:32	###Pardon ? ###What if you kill your mummy and daddy ? 
17083:10	###Sorry . ###Right yo 
17084:30	###Right yo ###Oh no , must n't ! 
17174:48	###Now , you should all still be working through the on a continuous basis . ###I am aware that , I am aware of actually two people in the second year who have never used it so far . 
17176:7	###Now , those two people or others who have n't used it much you really must get into this disc ! ###It 's the easy way to learn or it 's easy , it 's easy way to understand and then learn the megiture . 
17177:29	###It 's the easy way to learn or it 's easy , it 's easy way to understand and then learn the megiture . ###You have to have a stu , a good familiarity with organic momegiture if you do n't , you could be throwing marks away even before you get in that exam room ! 
17178:69	###You have to have a stu , a good familiarity with organic momegiture if you do n't , you could be throwing marks away even before you get in that exam room ! ###Cos there will be aspects where you will have to use momegiture . 
17180:12	###That they ask you specific questions of that naming it 's a multi-choice more importantly in your written answers you will have to in , you are expected to include and correct systematic ohms for any organics that you deal with . ###Plus , of course , it means you 're gonna go back in that direction so if they say something like erm two chlorapropane active with you need to be able to get structural formula from that name . 
17185:7	###Not for your own use I hasten to add ! ###They 've set up , increased the numbers of discs in the library in the workshop er , there 's no increasing them up here cos there 's , we need to buy a computer , but certainly up and in the workshop and in the library . 
17205:30	###So there 's all those sorts of possibilities . ###Now , let 's look at some examples and get you to name some of them as well . 
17210:10	###So , you really do need to understand the megditure in order to be able to say , oh yes , those two compounds are the same ! ###Just been drawn differently . 
17216:141	###Let 's take this example here I 've got a carbon chain there and I 'm going to put a methile group there and I 'm going to put a methile group there two , three that . ###Identical chain again let 's have a methile group there and one there let 's do one more of those a methile group there and a methile group there . 
17334:32	###And the two methile groups so it 's gonna be a die methile . ###It 's gonna be a , it 's gonna be a die methile hexane of some description now , to indicate the positions it 's either three or four , we take the lowest number both are on carbon number three 
17334:69	###And the two methile groups so it 's gonna be a die methile . ###It 's gonna be a , it 's gonna be a die methile hexane of some description now , to indicate the positions it 's either three or four , we take the lowest number both are on carbon number three 
17371:60	###Read these propenes . . ###If that was an alkane that would be a butane four carbons . 
17373:121	###. This is an alcohol it has an O H group so it is a butanole but you have to indicate where the O H group actually is it 's either on four or it 's on one . ###Oh yeah it is . 
17389:11	###Not , Butane two O L , no you see , you yourself . ###Why is it Butane three O L Kieran ? 
17497:107	###I can have one of these now I 've been the worst I 've been for about six months I really ! ###Ai n't I Trace ?

17652:38	###So you should do it ? ###That 's right . 
17706:21	###We never ever distil ether without checking first that it does n't contain incompoundable peroxides , organic peroxides which contain this and single bond cos things explode ! ###Yeah . 
17831:10	###Can I slap all of them ? ###Mm . 
17929:63	###Erm right if this you 're enjoying this Mark are n't you ? ###Dunno why , they 'll start me off now ! 
17932:13	###Yes , Daniel it 's true ! ###Do n't gasp in surprise ! 
17934:99	###You do actually have to look through to see the light coming out ! ###You look through and you rotate that eyepiece until you 've either got maximum brightness cos you got a second polaroid system in there as well you see you either get maximum brightness or complete darkness . 
17951:33	###You then rotate the eyepiece so you get back to the condition that you had before . ###So if you started off in complete darkness you rotate until you get complete darkness or the opposite . 
17951:77	###You then rotate the eyepiece so you get back to the condition that you had before . ###So if you started off in complete darkness you rotate until you get complete darkness or the opposite .

18105:84	###At least it was n't stuck up the bum ! ###Erm chemically speaking , if you carry out a reaction which can produce an optically active compound , you would normally the recenate and then you have to separate by either chemical method or the physical method and it 's usually not very easy .

18271:116	###Perhaps if I just quickly point out the main ones erm they have been amended in er , a later version of the document . ###Er , I think the main ones really , are on page one o six the final two lines of the first paragraph which says the two vacant blocks now really , there 's four it should just read , and does now read the demolition of the vacant blocks . 
18283:46	###It should be spring nineteen ninety five to spring nineteen ninety six . ###Okay , with that , I 'll le I 'll hand over to Nick to take you through the their present proposals . . 
18306:53	###In return for that you 're providing a to , to the society . ###We will be entering into a legal agreement with the er , the council to basically erm , set the criteria for the scheme this will establish the mix and the tenure er of the , of the er the scheme and to ensure that it it adheres to the , to the master plan . 
18323:25	###Thank you . ###I think it might help if I stand near the drawings . 
18408:149	###Yeah . ###Because we , I do not understand how I 
18411:60	###What we do do for our residents is employ a welfare benefit service so that they can maximise the er the housing benefit section that that they 're eligible for to to make the po properties as affordable as as they can be . ###And obviously , we 're , we 're concerned that people erm will rent our properties who will then be reliant entirely on housing benefit er and and and if they increase their income they may be worse off ! 
18433:82	###Erm this matter was raised at committee and I 'd like to explain the item of committee that prompted the letter from Carters Mead Resident 's Association . ###Can I just say a few brief things to this , firstly , I share their concern entirely and totally and I do n't think there 's an officer round this table who would n't agree with that , and I also believe , having met with all the board members this morning , I know that the board members similarly agree . 
18442:100	###just to to verify the fact that we are making so many , you said about pulling out as well is there a possibility of that ? ###Erm 
18531:61	###Les ? ###Thank you , . 
18533:8	###Er , as you know , I have n't been exactly an enthusiastic supporter of neighbourhood erm areas , but I have to confess ###Some never attended them ! 
18533:92	###Er , as you know , I have n't been exactly an enthusiastic supporter of neighbourhood erm areas , but I have to confess ###Some never attended them ! 
18598:34	###Well no I have n't got a problem ###I I have feelings about it , I I I mean , my , generally my experience I do n't know I have n't discussed with other members but er , when I the panel that I er , allocated to erm and I was telephoned , could a make , and certain dates were made and I finally made one then I was told , oh no that 's not convenient ! 
18618:34	###And what we 're getting here actually is a recreation of the area health authority they 're actually gonna be situated in the same office block where the old area authority used to be in Witham erm , and the community health council which I represent this authority on has certainly been er , raising a number of questions about this for fear of centralisation in Witham , erm with perhaps the lack of accessibility to local needs of West Essex and in Harlow particularly , . ###The question that the senior , the middle management staff will propose the authority , has been drawn almost exclusive , exclusively from North East and the Mid-Essex health authorities and not from West Essex . 
18634:19	###Thanks . ###Erm , I really feel that this consultation is coming more than a too late because we started on the slippery slope when the consortium was er first dreamed of o , you know about a year ago and set up in April and that really this is the sort of the inexorable next move , and this consultation is far far too late ! 
18634:158	###Thanks . ###Erm , I really feel that this consultation is coming more than a too late because we started on the slippery slope when the consortium was er first dreamed of o , you know about a year ago and set up in April and that really this is the sort of the inexorable next move , and this consultation is far far too late ! 
18694:12	###Erm it is er fair to say that London 's far easier to get to er , from Harlow than certain areas in Essex are erm , those are direct comments from the chief executive of the proposed erm health authority . ###The financial position of the provider , this was erm well in the report because the consultation document that was it quotes a figure o of erm , in the amount of patient 's treated erm , with the same amount of money . 
18711:60	###Seconded . ###Seconded , yes but Lorna ? 
18713:119	###Erm ya , I mean I 've already had what , I 've had what I 've had to say about the the the content of the thing I was merely going to ask where we go from here ? ###I 'm aware that our backs are up against the wall as regards time because the response is meant to be in by Friday erm I do n't think actually that this is the the paper that Vince is presenting , although in fact , surely raises issues , I do n't think it is actually response as it stands , I think it is a paper which raises items of issues for this committee to consider , I do n't think in itself it serves as a response . 
18778:24	###Yes . ###the advice centre and what has happened to with erm er , I 've er , if you 've read the reports you 'll see that er , that had been working er under er er er a considerable amount of er er stress and strain . 
18897:42	###And er , we 'll be a part , I know as councillors , Labour councillors we are caught in a trap because due the financial constraint that the government has placed upon us there is very little we could do but , oh I 'll get I I er crumbs of comfort from the speculators who may decide to to give us a few social housing . ###I 'm concerned for the people who are waiting for housing , I 'm concerned about young people who are living in i i in ten er , on the tenth floor of high rise flats , these people have been waiting a very very long time and each time er , the er these they are , the properties are er , de-counted they are going further and further behind . 
18976:11	###So if they , if they removed the local authorities judging we 'll be in a terrible position ! ###An absolutely diabolical situation because then the the the local authorities that have continued to avoid doing what they ought to have done will be rubbing their hands with glee while the others who have a a social conscience , a moral social conscience will be put under tremendous pressure ! 
18978:24	###So , we must oppose that and er also they 're asking for new powers er to move illegal travellers from land this is just another device because of their failure to provide sufficient sites throughout the country and if the of Essex County Council do their job er they they do n't need these new powers , what authority ought to be ha , er having are powers to provide some er , camping places for people . ###And er the question of the grants as well , I 'm opposed to the fact that they they 're going to if we do n't hurry up er , these two sites in Harlow will not , never be completed ! 
18988:14	###Er , because er our submission for a grant regarding these two sites were submitted prior to all this coming forth ###Yes . 
19004:41	###Ah we would n't , you would n't . ###We would n't be getting it . 
19017:67	###Erm we will continue to say that Harlow should have applied for designation years ago erm it 's very ###Sorry can you repeat that ? 
19052:49	###Well that concerns this this gentleman to extend the licensing . ###Oh yes sir , definitely . 
19134:38	###Mm . ###Well , practical purposes at this stage sir she maintains insufficient I 've no doubt the licensee will want to know a lot more about the situation , it 's very apparent it 's not long ago that they last ta transferred to their present holding . 
19142:67	###And the sort of concern about that ? ###Yes . 
19159:7	###I see , well I would of expected those premises not to be selling intoxicating liquor sir , they 've obviously not had a license for a month ! ###That will also be er considered by the licensing committee at the next hearing ! 
19239:56	###Your worships , legal aid was granted er on the thirteenth of September to affirm of burglary . ###Well obviously they 're not here your worship . 
19242:32	###I wish for the committal to go along please sir ? ###I 've been stuck up in this place 
19255:59	###If ###now then sir . 
19258:87	###Well in that case sir can you get the committee then please ? ###As of now . 
19265:10	###Well I do n't know what the situation is ! ###Well I 'm te , that 's what I 'm trying to tell you ! 
19266:31	###Well I 'm te , that 's what I 'm trying to tell you ! ###You 'll have to . 
19300:14	###Well it , it was adjourned last week for him to with instructions your worship . ###Yes we we 've adjourned this case for one week other enquiries can be made . 
19335:21	###Your worship , I would anticipate that it normally takes at least three weeks for a printout for the computer to be able to ###And this case is adjourned for three weeks in order that a computer printout will can be obtained . 
19447:144	###Your worships , Mr works for Wallbank aerials in Worley and he works for them as an engineer his vehicle was erm something that he did use for work , but unfortunately as a result of the accident his has been written off and he has n't yet been able to er , replace it and so he 's having to be erm er , chauffeured by the company to do his er his work . ###Erm he was using at that time an R registered Ford Escort er , which was er , only insured third party , fire and theft . 
19551:8	###So Mrs the court will endorse your licence that means that the fact that you have these offenses er against your record now will be entered onto on your driving licence by the court , the court will then send your driving licence to the driving licence centre at Swansea so that they can er also record on your driving record . ###You 'll get your licence back in about three weeks time from the driving licence centre .

19591:47	###Oh yes . ###Definitely . 
19664:38	###For all practical purposes at this stage sir she may appear to you to be a fit and proper person I 've no doubt the Licensing Committee will want to know a lot more about the situation sir . ###If I recall rightly I think that it 's not that long ago that the licence was transferred to the present holder . 
19672:70	###And the sort of concern about that aspect ? ###Yes . 
19686:8	###Well I would have expected those premises not to be selling intoxicating liquors you 've obviously not had a licence for a month . ###That will also be er considered by the licensing committee at the next hearing .

19767:48	###I wish the committee to go along please sir . ###I 've been stuck up in this part 
19785:41	###As of now . ###As I say sir we need to put this matter back to later in the day . 
19792:31	###Well I do n't know what the situation is ###Well I 'm telling , that 's what I 'm trying to tell you . 
19851:61	###What have you done about getting a , a replacement ? ###Well I have n't done anything at the moment because I did n't I did n't think it was worth it actually . 
19863:21	###Your Worships I would anticipate that it normally takes at least three weeks for a printout from a computer to be obtained . ###This case is adjourned for three weeks in order get a printout can be obtained . 
19965:215	###Erm and you will be aware that , er two of three of the er summonses that are now left for you to de deal with , that 's three of the four er do in fact relate to failure to produce documents . ###Er failure to produce his driving licence , failure to produce a test certificate for the vehicle and failure to produce his insurance document .

20074:92	###We came here on the ninth of June nineteen fifty . ###What did you why did you move to Harlow ? 
20080:9	###Well it really was so different from a built up place but er um , when , but the day that we came in it was mm , pouring with rain everywhere was muddy and er of course , i i there were only erm one part of this town this area , rather that had been occupied because all the other parts were all fields . ###There was just the erm Broomfield Staffield Tanys Dell erm Glebelands and that was the all the area that was built up when we came here . 
20081:213	###There was just the erm Broomfield Staffield Tanys Dell erm Glebelands and that was the all the area that was built up when we came here . ###Our children had to go to Chingford to school . 
20100:84	###I think it 's a wonderful place ! ###And I think the council are trying their utmost to make facilities for all ages . 
20107:8	###But they 've got to realise that Rome was n't built in a day ! ###And I mean , through the years which this town is about thirty four years old ? 
20107:49	###But they 've got to realise that Rome was n't built in a day ! ###And I mean , through the years which this town is about thirty four years old ? 
20110:21	###But people now are coming in and they 're expecting everything to be here . ###They do n't realise that it has taken many years to bring the town up to the standard it is now . 
20151:183	###Mm . ###So we talked and I said well we would think about it and we would let him know so we collected all the friends that we thought would like to help which were many people were very good to help ! 
20160:9	###And we 've , each time we had someone of importance to bring in the people . ###Now , Tommy Cooper he never charged us one penny ! 
20168:130	###We took the children , when we had the bus we took the children to Southend that was the first time they had all been out together and the owner of the Kersal and the person responsible on the council for the erm maintaining of of Southend , such as the Chairman , they put the Kersal at our disposal ! ###And before the children left they were given a carrier bag with all sorts of things that you could think of and to see the delight on those little children 's faces ! 
20243:98	###Mm . ###And she was saying how well my granddaughter was getting along in the University . 
20246:14	###Yeah . ###she 's so Americanized you see ? 
20394:72	###But did n't you come up a few days before us ? ###You were here before us were n't you ? 
20401:19	###It was dad , that bit was built ###Oh well , no what happen was 
20415:54	###no we did n't know what we were going to ###No it was a long way to come from Plymouth you know so we did n't know . 
20417:8	###We came on a , I think it was on a Friday or Saturday morning and I had to go back Sunday night , cos I was on duty on the Monday back in Plymouth , and I did a month in Plymouth , er , a month or five weeks no longer , and I came up each weekend to see them , my wife was left there then . ###Did n't

20544:232	###Erm ###er New Town children in the school ? 
20546:16	###no it was really New Town school children , because there was Forbert and Barnard 's school down the Old Town and that 's where the Old Town , all the Old Town people went , children went , so really Mark Hall was just New Town children you know , and then when , when we were eleven and had to go to another school we , er there was no comprehensive school in Harlow then , er we had to get on a bus and go to Chingford that was , did n't we ? ###Yeah 
20563:43	###There was , there was a resentment ###resentment to the new children , that I should of 
20569:18	###So you 've still got a feeling of the countryside then ? ###Oh it was yeah , yeah it was nice , I mean 
20571:14	###yeah I mean you had to go across fields to move house did n't you ? ###Pardon ? 
20763:8	###Well I do n't know what make it was but it came from the house , the furnishing company of Union Street , Plymouth I ca n't remember the shop . ###Do you remember when you got rid of one of your armchairs last year or the year before , they bought two new fireside chairs and one of the armchairs nearly had it 
20766:63	###and the men came , delivered the new ones and erm , one of them , er oh you said would you take the old one and they said , yeah , fine you know , dad said well it 'll take both of you , oh no , no , I can do that , he could n't even lift it you know cos they were so solid and two of them had a heck of a job did n't they ? ###Yeah 
20767:9	###Yeah ###Getting it out and that was just an armchair do n't know what they 'd do if they had to move the settee , but erm , that 's the difference in 
20812:7	###Oh yes , oh yeah , oh yeah ###but the actual rationing on furniture ended , at the end of nineteen fifty two but they brought in something called schedule T 
20813:21	###but the actual rationing on furniture ended , at the end of nineteen fifty two but they brought in something called schedule T ###We must of bought that suite before then 
20815:7	###Before then , yes , we must of bought it when we moved in cos I , I mean I was n't without a bed ###We did , we bought it as soon as we moved in because er 
20834:7	###I would n't know that ###And you ca n't remember where you bought it ? 
20836:7	###It must of been fifty one , June ###I bet mum 's still got the bill somewhere 
20852:203	###Well I do n't know it 's just what we liked at the time you know , we liked anything that was considered a bit way out then , you know ###Mm 
20898:25	###Yeah ###Mm 
20960:16	###Yeah ###Was that in the living room ? 
20985:88	###Yeah , I 'd like you to tell me about erm , what the house was that you left before you came to Harlow and why you came to Harlow ? ###Yes , if we skip all the intermediate years with , after the war I came back from the army to find we 'd been bombed out and were living in requisition accommodation , after a time , the , we were moved into a new flat over some shops . 
20993:58	###The accommodation differed in , in one respect and that , that was that in the flat we were on one floor , we had one bedroom , we moved into a house with two toilets separate bathroom and three bedrooms , which enabled us to spread our furniture around , enabled us to have visitors to receive members of the family . ###I think this is one of the essentials in Harlow and something that people should not forget , that is that , although there is a great deal of criticism possibly of the standard of building that went on over the years of the Development Corporation , compared with what most people came from , there was a very great elevation both in quality and in ideas . 
21026:31	###Sunnyside Road , and erm , it were it was good accommodation we had our own bathroom and toilet er but again accommodation was cramped , we had no spare room ###And we were n't proud , there was people came

21045:74	###We were offered some awful things though , in the first place ###Erm , I 've always been interested in housing and it did appear to me that however delightful Harlow may be , when the architects were designing properties , they designed a property without any consideration for the people who were to live in them . 
21052:33	###Yes erm , it was very obvious from the word go that they did n't want us . ###It was for a single person really was n't it there ? 
21141:111	###And it really is to to promote a couple of the initiatives of your instrument that I stand here . ###First of all I would like to bring to your attention the regional ecumenical teams .

21152:9	###Could I just conclude Moderator by saying that those who are engaged in ACTS the churches which are participating members of this action of churches together in Scotland are engaged in a journey together . ###The imaginations of each church and indeed s of the several members perhaps shape differently the goal that lies ahead .

21197:103	###You have certainly applied your mind to the work of the Board and you have encouraged its vision and its direction through your intellectual gifts and perceptions and insights . ###And you 've also brought your soul to bear on the work of the Board and the work of the church . 
21253:23	###It has been gratifying to learn that the panel 's work stimulated so much discussion and presbyteries and sessions have been generous in their acknowledgement of this . ###The panel hopes now that this statement of faith can be seen as a useful and fairly accessible indicator to outsiders as to what the faith is all about , and at the same time as a ring of words which at least the majority of us within the church can happily affirm . 
21263:9	###Dr . ###Moderator that 's a helpful question I , I 'm sure . 
21265:149	###But I must er be cagey in my answer to it . ###I , I think we will see how things go . 
21269:57	###And there is no doubt that a confession of faith perhaps is , is needed sometimes . ###We 're extraordinarily elusive about what exactly we believe in the Church of Scotland , we say , you know recognizing liberty of opinion always , and such things as do not enter into the substance of the faith , and then we do n't say what the substance of the faith is . 
21270:17	###We 're extraordinarily elusive about what exactly we believe in the Church of Scotland , we say , you know recognizing liberty of opinion always , and such things as do not enter into the substance of the faith , and then we do n't say what the substance of the faith is . ###Er so we are elusive and maybe the time will be , will come when we really must put it all down . 
21295:67	###And then as you know , no statement our , our Christian truth can never be encapsulated in any one statement . ###Another way of putting that is you 'll never please everybody but 
21320:7	###Can I ask which promises ? ###Is it the promises merely for baptism or the promises for confirmation in that the child is articulate and intelligent enough to answer ? 
21335:47	###Erm so I do n't honestly remember at what point the line that er Mr Bruce refers to er was removed or was transformed into what we have here . ###Er it became by his death on the cross and has triumphed over evil . 
21336:14	###Er it became by his death on the cross and has triumphed over evil . ###It 's a question of we were told always to be brief , it has to be brief , you ca n't say everything . 
21407:74	###Mr before we can ask for a seconder on it I 'd ask the clerk to make a de definition about expenditure that has not necessarily been costed beforehand . ###Yes Moderator I think it was Mr who drew my attention yesterday 
21414:77	###Moderator it is said that a passion for consistency is the mark of a small mind which probably explains why I have a passion for consistency . ###It seems to me that we are inclining to be very inconsistent in regard to two matters which have recently been very much before us . 
21415:7	###It seems to me that we are inclining to be very inconsistent in regard to two matters which have recently been very much before us . ###In the , when we dealt with the matter of children and communion , we based the whole case upon the doctrine that nothing must be allowed to stand in the way of the grace of God being available for all and sundry . 
21416:19	###In the , when we dealt with the matter of children and communion , we based the whole case upon the doctrine that nothing must be allowed to stand in the way of the grace of God being available for all and sundry . ###Nothing must be allowed to stand in the way of that . 
21448:56	###Er I think Mr is probably right correct er that rites ###er this is probably a job for the panel on worship . 
21478:8	###Yes I think so . ###Er Moderator er there is n't any reason in principle why this sh should n't happen that er this subject could n't come up at the presbytery clerks conference . 
21478:116	###Yes I think so . ###Er Moderator er there is n't any reason in principle why this sh should n't happen that er this subject could n't come up at the presbytery clerks conference . 
21551:9	###And therefore I , I would like to tell you an experience I had in Madagascar because it 's one of the things that will be in my memory on my deathbed . ###I visited a college there in , in that offshore island in the Indian Ocean and met the principal of that theological college and I said to him , I asked him how the college was going and he gave the same blandness to his answer as to my question and then he said of his theological college we are still training an aristocracy for the church and ensuring the inertia of the people of God . 
21553:152	###And I had to say , inside myself , that 's awful like the kirk . ###Cos in a very profound sense this is true , and I was so glad that it was I think a very serious part of the flow of Dr Stuart ' s report that he mentioned that the er s sense of the ministry of the whole people of God as being much more than a distant objective for us , but something of absolutely essential , vital importance to the whole life and service and outreach of the church . 
21635:173	###nine hundred and ten . ###I have I think it 's an addendum erm to rewrite a particular phrase in the statement to become he died on the cross for the sins of the world and by his resurrection as already in print . 
21646:12	###Is this referring to a moral triumph over injustice ? ###Is it referring just to a triumphalistic idea of atonement in which everything is just alright in the end ? 
21649:41	###The statement does have a phrase in it in which it says that Jesus declared the forgiveness of sins but there is an immense difference between declaring forgiveness and making forgiveness . ###An immense difference indeed . 
21655:7	###And on the Scottish understanding , it is very easy for somebody to come along and say well jo God just now declares that we are forgiven . ###But we have a much deeper understanding than that . 
21657:37	###God had to do something on the cross , in Christ , in order that his love which he has for us as sinners might become forgiveness for us in reality . ###Paul in second Corinthians said that Christ became sin for us , a glorious exchange took place , something happened on the cross which was necessary . 
21746:58	###This brilliant piece of oratory which I have in my hand here , in addition to many other valuable insights , contains three alternative definitions of faith , two gentle digs at Professor , and one definitive statement of when the third millennium begins . ###However I am not so enamoured of the sound of my own voice that , bearing in mind what er Dr has said about the amount of business , I would insist on inflicting it upon it if someone would be prepared to second it and the convenor and the assembly be prepared to accept it . 
21775:40	###We 're all theologians , but we do obviously depend heavily on the help of the professionals . ###Er that help is , there are fewer to draw from , i it 's also far more difficult for them to spare the time , the pressures on the academics are considerable nowadays . 
21789:5	###Like oil and water . ###S so 
21791:14	###has to be done , I would n't agree with it . ###I 'm just asking Professor for my own clarification at this stage , and it is that he does not agree to accept Mr ' s addendum . 
21851:60	###I 'm allowed one more minute after the bell . ###I finish Moderator affirming that if we are in communion with Jesus Christ we are necessarily in communion with one other . 
21852:8	###I finish Moderator affirming that if we are in communion with Jesus Christ we are necessarily in communion with one other . ###All other doctrines are very secondary to that , and the question is are we to express that reality or must we continue to obscure it . 
21924:30	###The Board 's policy of completely absorbing all capital costs and charging nothing for income on capital amounts on average to a subsidy of ninety six pounds per resident per week . ###And the Board thinks there 's a reasonable subsidy to offer to its elderly residents . 
21931:40	###Needless to say , needless to say this deficit has not involved any additional call whatsoever upon the mission and aid fund of the church from which the Board receives an annual contribution of around four hundred thousand pounds towards its overall budget of twenty million pounds . ###Moderator that works out at a contribution of seventy five pence per minute towards the actual cost of our operation of forty pounds and twenty three pence per minute . 
21943:41	###As we indicate to the general assembly in the printed report , the Board could have insisted on its rights under contract made with those bodies and the Board was confident that it would have won any action in the courts . ###But to pursue this matter would have delayed for some years the opening of much needed services . 
22027:7	###I just ###I think having I think having waited so patiently for so long that you can wait a little lo further . 
22108:60	###Well we want to say there is hope . ###As Christians we 've discovered about reconciliation in our own lives and we know the need of it in lots of areas in human relationships . 
22178:125	###Now let me read the words for the s benefit of those who do n't have them add new section eight and rem renumber eight urge his majesty 's government to give continuing and careful concern to the many situations in which lack of financial resources are still causing elderly people grave hardship . ###Having read that I immediately repent me in dust and ashes for having committed a dreadful grammatical error . 
22196:47	###I have n't used the word poverty I 've used a phrase about lack of financial resources because it relates more obviously and directly to many of the concerns of the Board for example almost certainly the real reason why there was no room in the inn at Bethlehem is that the income of a village carpenter did n't go near the exorbitant prices being charged by mine host when , to use the good Scots phrase , the cow calved and there was this boom over the crows for the census . ###In other words , lack of financial resources can contribute to homelessness and it does . 
22202:30	###Contributing to homelessness . ###Moderator if the Board wanted a patron saint , my sole nominee would certainly be the good Samaritan cos he got it right . 
22220:20	###And what happens in actual human situations which are what get me , and I 'm going to give you three and I guarantee their genuineness you will doubt them all I have not the least fear but I guarantee you their genuineness , they come from the records of Age Concern Scotland of which I am the president . ###Here are a couple who are doing very awkward cooking over an open fire because their cooker has packed in and they can get a new one only in terms of a loan which is compulsorily payable by deduction from their , from their pension every week and they 've a Scot 's dread of debt . 
22225:100	###Sandy takes her for walks , not the other way round . ###And because she happens to live reasonably near a park , she walks Sandy or Sandy walks her in the park , she meets other dog walkers and they are her human contacts . 
22249:184	###The cut back of social services by public agencies has meant for us , and I 'm sure for you , er the church becomes more and more important in helping people survive and live more fully . ###In erm our situation dedicated persons on the front lines have found themselves overwhelmed by increases in human needs and dwindling resources with which to meet those human needs and so we 've tried to get innovative and do something about it . 
22300:88	###So clearly in this period the U K holidaymaker moved from being someone who primarily took their holidays in the U K very definitely into someone who was now taking their holidays abroad . ###Now furthermore , if we look at what was happening to the population itself , remember that under the economic basis of looking at determinants of demand , we saw that income was a crucial factor . 
22360:34	###North Sea oil . ###North Sea oil came on board and suddenly we had a product which people wanted to buy . 
22387:15	###Right , Club Eighteen to Thirty . ###Okay so Club Eighteen to Thirty was doing good business around this period because of this situation . 
22413:7	###So the foreign holidays , because you 're guaranteed sunshine , cheap alcohol , everything else , somehow being seen as better than the traditional British holiday . ###At this time remember the traditional British holiday was seen as staying in a boarding house with a landlady . 
22484:41	###Your own health and fitness . ###Now this can become an increasingly important factor because of all the activity holidays around today . 
22487:69	###Erm unless you 've got a doctor 's note saying that you 've passed the medical , they wo n't allow you to actually go on the activity holiday . ###Now that 's a drawback in many respects , but it 's also if you er think about it , a very good selling point . 
22515:34	###Again trying to get more of this lifestyle into their day to day existence . ###Comparative prices are gonna be a motivating factor . 
22524:101	###And finally , the big one , the impact of the mass media . ###Everything from newspapers to television movies the lot . 
22524:130	###And finally , the big one , the impact of the mass media . ###Everything from newspapers to television movies the lot . 
22646:24	###From experience . ###From experience and there are also the occasions very often when you 're , if you like , force fed . 
22647:7	###From experience and there are also the occasions very often when you 're , if you like , force fed . ###When you 've got exams you have to learn . 
22696:10	###Er you 've got , also down here , experimental the person who experiments if you like with different cultures , trying to think of a different way , who 's interested in religions . ###Now you may think that the number of people in this category here is very minimal , but there 's increasing numbers of people around the world travelling now who are motivated by things like this . 
22760:8	###He 's just a bit grumpy , he 's a bit grumpy at times , excellent barmen er I 'm usually down there s sampling the , the Diet Coke or some such wondrous thing like that . ###Er and you will definitely get to know lots of people down there and it 's a good focal point for the Guild . 
22764:15	###A free legal service is offered by the Guild . ###It 's a , a firm of city centre solicitors , they 're very very good indeed er I recommend it thoroughly . 
22765:18	###It 's a , a firm of city centre solicitors , they 're very very good indeed er I recommend it thoroughly . ###It er does n't have to be a problem related to college , any problem you 've got er come and see me , it 's as well to take advantage of it cos those of you who have been involved in legal wranglings before will it 's quite an expensive business , so 
23131:16	###Our eyes . ###Our eyes , yes . 
23265:19	###You 've found a certain Paul ? ###Yeah , but I mean . 
23313:9	###As you long as ? ###Yes you can . 
23413:111	###You want somewhere in the region of about four engineers to each school so work it out yourself , it 's quite a job to actually get the ratio right . ###But , in this area of East Anglia , which of course , includes this part of Essex itself we have got quite a tidy ratio at the moment of these panels of school teachers and panels of young engineers to actually look at a national curriculum and work out some kind of erm time cycle when a young engineer could come in and actually cross the t 's and dot the i 's on parts which obviously the teachers do n't know about . 
23442:126	###In a way , I 'm interested at the Engineering Prize Federation and C B I have also began to realise that we ca n't survive , and I 'm sorry if you 're retailers , ca n't survive on the service in this country , we gotta survive on a manufacturing industry in this country and the only way you can do that is by having , really a pool of trained people . ###But this kind of stimulus neighbourhood he engineers point of view is actually extremely interesting and give you a hell of a lot of job satisfaction because you are getting the youngsters really involved in what it 's all about . 
23442:140	###In a way , I 'm interested at the Engineering Prize Federation and C B I have also began to realise that we ca n't survive , and I 'm sorry if you 're retailers , ca n't survive on the service in this country , we gotta survive on a manufacturing industry in this country and the only way you can do that is by having , really a pool of trained people . ###But this kind of stimulus neighbourhood he engineers point of view is actually extremely interesting and give you a hell of a lot of job satisfaction because you are getting the youngsters really involved in what it 's all about . 
23501:7	###Oh well ! ###sad but er 
23572:4	###Mm . ###thank you very much indeed for a very informative talk erm I am actually , myself , er a chartered structural engineer so , what you 
23629:102	###Erm er , who will giving the talk for them . ###Er , at the time , we had no response when this was announced by Jim erm , it does in fact clash with our council meeting but in view of the fact that erm our business meeting Se , in December is not until the second Monday , I would be happy to put the erm council meeting back to the following Monday if there was sufficient interest from the members . 
23725:101	###And they say I ca n't remember it just happened so quick that I ca n't remember , they have been unconscious for a , it may be just a split second , it 's affected the brain , they are concussed . ###So let 's go through the signs and symptoms of concussion . 
23727:36	###They could have a headache depending on how it was caused , they could be confused , but not always and there could be that brief loss of consciousness and so you must check the memory recall if they do know what 's happened well then go back a little bit further to see if they can remember what they did last night or something but erm , make sure , on that memory recall . ###Now the face when you look at them they 're going to be very pale , cold and clammy the eyes well , erm , unless they 're really into concussion they 're possibly normal . 
23734:65	###No , not yet ###Concussion will lead us very nicely onto compression and if anybody in your place of work has a head injury at all a knock on their head and they say , most people do do n't they ? 
23761:54	###All in favour say aye , how 's that ? ###Right , let 's go on a bit further , so we 've just done concussion , compression er the next one is an illness , epilepsy now epilepsy , two types , you get the petit mal which is the small fit and the grand mal which is the erm large fit or the full , full fit . 
23763:147	###Now anybody can have erm within the areas if you like our part , no you do n't have to have all the signs and symptoms to say that person has had an epileptic fit . ###Now at this st this stage usually the do-gooders who do n't know any better and put and insist that something should go in the mouth and it should n't , you never ever put anything in anybody 's mouth at all . 
23766:28	###The answer is once they 've clenched their teeth there 's nothing you can do about it , if their tongue is there I 'm afraid it 's just hard luck . ###Tablets control epilepsy very , very well now and you can go for probably years without an epileptic fit , then all of a sudden erm somebody will think oh I 'll try leaving off my medication and of course they have a fit . 
23780:22	###and then he has a sleep for half an hour ###That 's right , most people with epilepsy they 're much better if they go to sleep and you do n't wake them up , if you wake the person up from a sleep that 's just had an epileptic fit they 'll be vomiting , but if you let them sleep through it then erm , then they 're usually fine . 
23787:165	###Going into system ###Being pumped 
23800:58	###Now the diabetic , I 'll leave that for a moment because I 'll do that in a moment , erm the absorption , usually gardeners , agricultural people that have , dealing with ordinary insecticides , pesticides , herbicides and all the other -cides that er , are about today , they 're usually protected , but sometimes either you get somebody in a garden with and using all these things and they , they do n't read packets do they any more ? ###They think ah look there 's a bit of drop of water in , there 's a packet of something let 's stick it in and stir it up , they never read a packet to see what it could do . 
23814:51	###Now the one we are going to talk about first of all is the too little sugar where your person has been stabilized and they 're taking insulin injections . ###Now hypoglycaemia , hypo meaning too little , glycaemia sugar . 
23822:38	###Shock ###Shock , but after a while their limbs 'll start trembling and they become very confused , now a person , a perfectly nice person , oh , you know , always very helpful and kind can suddenly become aggressive and they really do become aggressive and , if they go to violence their strength , oh where they get it from god only knows , but they could literally throw a person across the room . 
23828:19	###Pardon ? ###They 'll throw you across the room 
23839:15	###Yeah ###yes , but you knew 
23844:7	###no , no , but once he 's taken it and then he 's come round and erm he realizes what it 's , what he 's done , yeah . ###So once a person becomes unconscious , remember they 've got to go to hospital because they can only get worse , right , there is n't any , enough sugar in that body to , to be able to work properly so they 'll only get worse . 
23918:19	###that feels fine ###Or in your casualty 
23922:92	###Alright ###get another one from the box 
23935:27	###Once again , now it does n't matter which way round you start , you can start left over right or right over left , but the second time you do it opposite to the first time , so the first time I put the left one over first and the right one over that and then tuck it through , just like tying a shoe lace really , okay ? ###And the next , pick the ends up , I put the right one down first and the left one across it and then put that one through and then that 's a reef knot no that 's a granny over there anyone not sure ? 
23987:11	###Yeah ? ###A couple more to show you then you can practise these when you have a bit more practice time so we can get you out to lunch on time . 
24013:51	###One of them , of course you will , you use a roller bandage wo n't you again ? ###In this instance you can put it across the eyebrow , right , across the eyebrow , ask them to hold it and if you 're doing a bandage like this the way to keep it on is to have one part of the bandage going above the ear and the next time you go round go below the ear right , go above the ear and the next time you go round go below the ear okay and then finally just tie it off , get the idea ? 
24138:24	###and it 'll flow out , okay , now we know that 's the difference in colour and I 've already told you that the arteries have got muscles in their walls , what 's the difference in between the wall of the muscle , muscular wall , let 's put my teeth back in , the muscular wall of the artery and the wall of the vein ? ###the vein has got the valve to it , but only the veins in these parts , the extremities , you see , the lower abdomen and legs , arms , you do n't find those veins everywhere 
24166:87	###What do you think they 'd be like by now ? ###Dead 
24178:188	###Yeah , you might just do that , as I say all we can do is tell you what is possible , okay , there are going to be in ###your own instinct about what is the sensible thing to do and the right thing to do in that incident and take charge , and you will just get on and do the very , very best that you can , you know what you need to do , you need to stop the bleeding , you know what the person needs , he needs medical aid quickly okay ? 
24178:204	###Yeah , you might just do that , as I say all we can do is tell you what is possible , okay , there are going to be in ###your own instinct about what is the sensible thing to do and the right thing to do in that incident and take charge , and you will just get on and do the very , very best that you can , you know what you need to do , you need to stop the bleeding , you know what the person needs , he needs medical aid quickly okay ? 
24267:44	###These particles , this particular matter is generally given the sort of generic term seston some of those particles are mineral particles some of them are colloidal aggregates as the iron tends , iron , iron , ions tend to come together to form colloids in solution and some of them are particles of biological origin . ###So there are a whole range of different origins to these particles but they 're all floating around in the sea water . 
24361:74	###And that was the technique that was really used up until the sixties for the determination of salinity . ###Whole research cruises where water samples were being taken at many depths , every sample that came back was titrated on board ship to get the silver nitrate to establish the chlorinity and hence the salinity . 
24363:9	###These days we can do it much easier and we do it electrically , so we can use a relationship between conductivity which has to be er compensated for temperature and pressure at which you 're doing your readings , and that gives us a measure of our chlorinity and then that gives us a measure back to our salinity . ###And modern salinometers will automatically compensate for the temperature and pressure and do this conversion so you can get a direct read out from an electrical instrument of the salinity . 
24364:29	###And modern salinometers will automatically compensate for the temperature and pressure and do this conversion so you can get a direct read out from an electrical instrument of the salinity . ###But one must still be wary the fact that although we 've got this nice electric gadget , that we drop the probe into a bucket of water and it gives us er a salinity it is still entirely dependent on this ratio and this ratio is based on the constancy of composition which is very good for open ocean waters but breaks down in coastal waters where erosional processes , where fresh water additions and the sediment loads of the rivers may actually alter this ratio , okay ? 
24370:9	###It 's measuring a refractive index of the solution but , and giving you a read out in terms of salinity , okay . ###So a useful field technique . 
24397:17	###So river water is greater than sea water , proportionately , for those elements . ###Okay ? 
24570:23	###No it 's ###Yeah I know but they 're not exactly over run with them are they ? 
24620:10	###Who ? ###We 're missing out currents . 
24645:66	###Sea surface temperature affects processes in the atmosphere ocean and atmosphere form one system . ###Our work proceeds by trying to model this ocean atmosphere system and initially we made these models to develop an understanding but it turned out that the models worked pretty well to make predictions . 
24768:96	###Rare bird ###this is very swift , some of us when er 
24807:20	###And Bill loves the wildlife , he 's a dedicated bird- watcher although he hardly looks like it when servicing the huge polarizers that turn coal into a fine powder for burning . ###This powderized coal is the fuel for the power station . 
24850:42	###Er , O five ###Yeah , it 's been there for quite a while . 
24857:53	###Yeah ###and er a nice white belly on it , on the wing , we 'll put him back into the marsh shall we ? 
24902:65	###So if you wanna select all the text you 've written , she shift F ten selects the whole document . ###And essentially , you only will change the appearance of the text which is appearing in your vers video . 
24955:16	###So , if you 've got a mouse you could actually help speed up a lot of this editing but , I said , I 've not written in the mouse commands into this schedule because we did n't actually have mice on all work stations when this was written . ###So , as I go round I 'll show you erm , how to use the mouse er a as as and when it becomes er appropriate . 
25019:14	###Yeah . ###But , then , that 's all your files that are available now , I think you 've lost 
25161:88	###You get cold ###Mm and shiver . 
25162:43	###Mm and shiver . ###Right the body surface at birth is wet and therefore cools quite rapidly so they 've got big surface area and they 're born wet and they have to be dried off . 
25168:126	###And it 's con the temperature is constant , it 's like being in an incubator . ###Body temperature is ninety eight point four is n't it ? 
25196:49	###Yeah ###That 's better , top goes , but right so babies cannot shiver which is a temperature raising or maintaining mechanism . 
25198:28	###We 've said that when it 's a baby inside its mum , does n't have to control its own temperature , and in actual fact it 's several days after birth , after the baby 's born that it can effectively produce its own heat and its metabolism functions efficiently . ###Metabolism is the process by which you take in food , use it and convert it into energy and heat , er several days , so there were several days after the baby 's born when it 's really very much at risk of getting cold injury .

25764:43	###When the baby is born what is the baby fed on ? ###Milk 
25764:65	###When the baby is born what is the baby fed on ? ###Milk 
25812:7	###So the diet is quite simple . ###When these babies are diagnosed there 's a mad panic everywhere I can tell you , phone calls everywhere , people rushing round . 
25817:97	###Sorry Sarah ? ###Does n't their immune system cope with it or not ? 
25831:10	###Twenty ###Sixteen to eighteen years , they can actually have a normal diet and they can begin to eat all these wonderful things , okay ? 
25849:32	###they have children do n't they ? ###Do you think that these women can actually have children ? 
25850:84	###Do you think that these women can actually have children ? ###Yeah , but they might pass onto what they had to the child . 
25853:119	###What does that say ? ###In female 
25967:9	###Nikki ? ###Yeah I 've got erm Esther . 
26060:15	###I know you 've got a lot of work to do . ###Have n't got time ! 
26336:40	###Yes . ###Thanks . 
26342:7	###when you paint a picture when you paint a picture you put all the information in the picture that you need to present the idea to other people . ###The same thing applies when you build up a story in words . 
26448:11	###In the distant she heard the sound of an ice cream van with it 's with it 's jingly little tune playing and she thought oh , I 'd love an ice cream ! ###Yeah , I , you may laugh but you see if you 're writing stories for a , for a young child then you 've got to be explicit , you 've got to be colourful and you 've got to talk in a basic language that that child will talk that like that at that age . 
26598:54	###you all to try and do this time is to avoid if you can mouthing words , mouthing dialogue . ###Mouthing dialogue in mime is an easy get out ! 
26614:35	###Mm ? ###You wa you wanna have a look ? 
26638:103	###A few weeks ago we were talking about lifting objects and the size of the objects . ###If you lifted a large laundry basket think about the size of a laundry basket , think about where the hands would go then down , lift it up and if it 's full of laundry then it 's obviously going to be heavier than if it was empty but that 's the size . 
26670:15	###Did you do it happily ? ###What do you do 
26800:35	###Now I , I often gives in , in schools , and I particularly show that slide because as you can see it goes up to the year twenty forty er now I shall be a hundred and four in the year twenty forty I wo n't ask you to calculate what age you will be in the year twenty forty it might be quite large erm ###some of you are a lot younger than me of course , it could be a lot smaller , but er er showing this to teenagers , if you work out what age a teenager will be in the year twenty forty , they 'll be about er in their mid sixties so this period of time , basically , is the time over which our present er generation of schoolchildren will have their adult life . 
26800:47	###Now I , I often gives in , in schools , and I particularly show that slide because as you can see it goes up to the year twenty forty er now I shall be a hundred and four in the year twenty forty I wo n't ask you to calculate what age you will be in the year twenty forty it might be quite large erm ###some of you are a lot younger than me of course , it could be a lot smaller , but er er showing this to teenagers , if you work out what age a teenager will be in the year twenty forty , they 'll be about er in their mid sixties so this period of time , basically , is the time over which our present er generation of schoolchildren will have their adult life . 
26802:37	###So these basically are the problems that they 're gonna have to er er have to face . ###Now uranium erm is , is er a non-renewable resource like oi oil and coal and gas but there 's an awful lot of it in the world and this is erm the reserves of the energy they can give are compared to the remaining reserves of coal or and er gas , you can see it 's one of the largest energy resources on on earth . 
26806:12	###Er I 'm sure they did n't , I 'm sure he did n't believe it either . ###What is likely to happen of course is that er in the year two thousand and ten when we do need these fast reactors , we 'll be buying in French or Japanese technology as we 've done in many other areas which is all rather sad really . 
26806:34	###Er I 'm sure they did n't , I 'm sure he did n't believe it either . ###What is likely to happen of course is that er in the year two thousand and ten when we do need these fast reactors , we 'll be buying in French or Japanese technology as we 've done in many other areas which is all rather sad really .

26807:50	###What is likely to happen of course is that er in the year two thousand and ten when we do need these fast reactors , we 'll be buying in French or Japanese technology as we 've done in many other areas which is all rather sad really . ###You do n't have to , it does n't have to be mined , we do n't have to import it from any Arabs , it 's ours , we own it and it gives us that amount of energy but only if we develop the fast er reactors . 
26810:128	###Now of course there are other er forms of erm er o o of fuel er there 's coal erm and we have large stocks of coal in this country er enough for about two hundred er years er again you ask the question well why therefore is the , is the government coal cl cl closing down er a large part of the coal industry ? ###Erm a again the answer is it 's cheaper to import it from er overseas . 
26820:15	###That er , if built , would provide us with about ten percent of our electricity at current rates of use . ###Erm it 's er would take about er twenty years to build , would cost about ten billion pounds , but of course once you 've built it , er the running costs are very er small . 
26834:108	###Of the man made er sources of radiation , twelve of the thirteen percent you see are from medical uses from X-rays , that kind of thing , and only one percent comes from all the others , of which point one percent comes from nuclear er installations . ###So erm er erm by n by no means er could you call one point one percent of something that can vary by factors of three in , in , in , in Cornwall the natural radiation is three times what it is in , in Essex erm er but they seem to be quite er healthy nevertheless in Cornwall erm so point one percent is er varies by factors of three , obviously ca n't be considered to be erm er a major political er a major erm er environmental hazard . 
26841:22	###which all goes to show that yes , you know in large doses radiation can be harmful to you , er but in the sort , the sort of levels that you and I are likely to come across er almost certainly something else will get you first . ###Thank you gentlemen . 
26894:12	###I mean nobody pinched it , it er actually just went into the general melting pot . ###So that national er budget that had been accumulating over , over twenty thirty years just basically vanished . 
26894:28	###I mean nobody pinched it , it er actually just went into the general melting pot . ###So that national er budget that had been accumulating over , over twenty thirty years just basically vanished . 
26902:199	###I wo n't say too much about the football cos Manchester United are on top . ###Erm ironically I was one of those that went from Essex to Manchester and I did live up there for a couple of years but er decided to come back . 
26922:45	###Well I started school at the erm national school in the High Street by the fountain . ###Erm nineteen twenty one . 
26923:63	###Erm nineteen twenty one . ###Erm I remem erm y you used to erm erm take , have to take exams and if you passed the exams you could go to Alma Green Secondary School . 
27033:17	###Pardon ? ###How many hours a week did you use to work at your job ? 
27034:14	###How many hours a week did you use to work at your job ? ###And what hours did you have to put in for your Home Guard duty ? 
27034:84	###How many hours a week did you use to work at your job ? ###And what hours did you have to put in for your Home Guard duty ? 
27036:13	###You used to have to do er all night from seven till seven erm you was on , called out for er on weekends you had to parade every Sunday morning . ###See th this is what I 'm saying , you 'd done all them hours and then you was at it again on the weekend . 
27038:164	###You 'd g had to parade on the Sunday erm for weapon training , and one Sunday we earlier on , we had n't fired a rifle , so it was arranged for us to fire a rifle at a rifle range . ###So we was er called out at nine o' clock on the Sunday morning transport was laid on and we was taken over to , to fire in woods at Fradley , the other side of Lichfield . 
27039:84	###So we was er called out at nine o' clock on the Sunday morning transport was laid on and we was taken over to , to fire in woods at Fradley , the other side of Lichfield . ###We was there till six o' clock in the afternoon and it took us from the er ten o' clock in the morning , say about ten when we got there , it took us from ten till six to fire five rounds of ammunition because there was that many there and you had to wait your turn . 
27186:169	###Stalin 's policy has changed dramatically . ###Up until nineteen twenty seven he 's been saying work with the Kuomintang , work with the bourgeois nationalists , work with the parties to your right .

27260:120	###to look after them when they get old . ###Yes . 
27287:30	###And then there 's the class structure . ###Here 's the peasants The gentry made up three percent of the population in the countryside . 
27289:72	###The rich peasants made up another seven percent I have to check to see I 've got the figure 's right the middle peasants , twenty percent the poor peasants seventy percent . ###A rich peasant is a peasant who works his own land but will employ some wage labour as well because he has a large enough plot to be able to , to need to do that . 
27291:58	###A middle peasant is somebody who is more or less entirely self sufficient , he does n't hire any labour but nor does he have to work for anybody else , his plot is big enough for him to be able to support himself and his family . ###A poor peasant , who made up seventy percent of the population , is a peasant who does n't have a plot big enough to support himself and his family . 
27291:100	###A middle peasant is somebody who is more or less entirely self sufficient , he does n't hire any labour but nor does he have to work for anybody else , his plot is big enough for him to be able to support himself and his family . ###A poor peasant , who made up seventy percent of the population , is a peasant who does n't have a plot big enough to support himself and his family . 
27295:45	###The middle peasants owned twenty five percent which meant that the , the poor peasants , making up seventy percent owned just twenty five percent of the land . ###So on top of the appalling poverty of Chinese rural life there is a very unequal distribution of land which means that some people are desperately poor compared with others . 
27306:83	###I just want to read three anecdotes which , and I mean I 've given you sort of odd statistics and the advantage of anecdotes is that they actually put flesh on the bones I think , and they really give you a sense of what it meant to be er a peasant in China in the nineteen thirties . ###A poor middle aged peasant couple of Cum Sien in Honan province were dependent for their subsistence on the wages of their only son who worked in a coal mine . 
27361:18	###shall I finish off after the break ? ###Yes . 
27361:31	###shall I finish off after the break ? ###Yes . 
27424:13	###As I say I 'm not going to respond immediately cos I think other people ought to . ###Well I 'd like to say to that that er no Marx did n't specifically erm erm look to Britain or er Germany , only in the sense that they , at the time most advanced and he , he reckoned that er ideas of communism would spread only in the most advanced countries who in course of time would influence other countries . 
27432:32	###Yes well if you tell us what your definition ###I would s I would , I would say it is that i it is the theory and the practise of international working class revolution . 
27434:47	###And I would say that all of those elements have to be there . ###It is a political theory but it 's also an attempt to act on that political theory so it 's practise as well . 
27434:81	###And I would say that all of those elements have to be there . ###It is a political theory but it 's also an attempt to act on that political theory so it 's practise as well . 
27434:135	###And I would say that all of those elements have to be there . ###It is a political theory but it 's also an attempt to act on that political theory so it 's practise as well . 
27435:30	###It is a political theory but it 's also an attempt to act on that political theory so it 's practise as well . ###It 's the idea that you ca n't have socialism in one country , it has to be international it 's the idea that it has to be based on the working class because the working class is the agent of socialism and it has to be by revolution because the ruling class wo n't give up its power and wealth voluntarily . 
27438:50	###I would agree with that but I 'll take it further to say that , and if you read Marx you 'd find this very clear , what he meant ultimately that the working class would achieve is a kind of a society where there was a common ownership of the means of life . ###No ruling class , no working class , just people producing wealth as they produced it , consuming it that would be an efficient society where nobody would go hungry , there would be no unemployment , no poverty and er it 's the ultimate objective of er the human race . 
27458:52	###Mm see ###Marx , Marx did n't Marx did not anticipate leaders . 
27480:9	###Because middle class will push the lower class down and be supported by the upper class . ###Sounds 
27552:16	###That 's right . ###Er I mean they had a family in er Russia did n't they ? 
27562:47	###Well ###sell to the public . 
27571:14	###Yeah ###year a well 
27587:7	###and even if you want to ###erm 
27719:13	###but now and they have dispensed with that a hundred years later and more than a hundred years . ###So it takes a long time think more egalitarian . 
27723:13	###Yes most probably ###no it 's up to us . 
27725:87	###It does n't have to take a long time , it 's up to us here and now . ###yes but I mean people do n't give up what they have , that 's human nature . 
27744:17	###And I do n't think everybody 's going around in eastern Europe thinking oh what we need is to get back to the old Stalinist system where you , you know , you had someone telling you what to do all the time . ###Far from it . 
27755:80	###that gives rise to the authoritarianism . ###surely that also suits the , the people at the bottom because i be because the , the government is , is producing work in effect it means that the people at the bottom have jobs and , and can earn money and , and so they 're , they 're lot actually improves . 
27756:18	###surely that also suits the , the people at the bottom because i be because the , the government is , is producing work in effect it means that the people at the bottom have jobs and , and can earn money and , and so they 're , they 're lot actually improves . ###I mean th they , they might do n't necessarily see why it 's improving and what 's behind it , but their lot must improve if there 's industrialization and weapons and things to be made , that they they have jobs and presumably have more money than they had before when they were just sort of not doing very much . 
27770:8	###Unless you 'd er think of America , but they 've got so much problems there that they 've got to look within themselves now have n't they ? ###Otherwise there 's going to be chaos there if they do n't stop now and look within themselves instead of all of this interfering in other countries which they 've done in the past . 
27801:7	###No ###it 's never going to happen . 
27806:148	###I 'd like to take up your point about is it that erm after revolution and so on and break downs , governments er countries , say like Russian , China er some of these eastern European countries , they 're motivation goes to building their country up to resist occupation . ###Erm that seems to be the main motivation but I do n't think it is , personally , er it might be what is suggested to them because if they look like going socialist again , then it is not what the majority of the capitalist wants , or the major powers want . 
27806:166	###I 'd like to take up your point about is it that erm after revolution and so on and break downs , governments er countries , say like Russian , China er some of these eastern European countries , they 're motivation goes to building their country up to resist occupation . ###Erm that seems to be the main motivation but I do n't think it is , personally , er it might be what is suggested to them because if they look like going socialist again , then it is not what the majority of the capitalist wants , or the major powers want . 
27845:67	###which would be capable of sweeping away the Kuomintang and putting into power the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party . ###Yeah . 
27846:18	###Yeah . ###And I suppose , I mean if I was to answer the question was it a good thing I would have to say no . 
27849:11	###I think the Communist Party actually adhered to that idea in the nineteen twenties . ###nineteen twenties 
27850:7	###nineteen twenties ###Did n't it have to survive first though ? 
27855:7	###it could expand , unless it could gather strength and produce an army er it was on the road to annihilation which was their the course of erm Chiang Kai-Shek 's was n't it ? ###Which persisted even through the march and so on . 
27966:9	###These things have been taken away from you . ###That 's right . 
27987:40	###And I think these are very dangerous erm threads that run through the society of er you know , the , the international community where we , we live on this fear almost . ###We 're frightened of what will happen and sometimes we have need to be frightened , you know , they are going to do very different things because they disagree violently with us . 
27988:221	###We 're frightened of what will happen and sometimes we have need to be frightened , you know , they are going to do very different things because they disagree violently with us . ###And that 's why your idea that I think it does have to be a very gradual process where we learn to trust each other , we learn to live by our decisions that we make together rather than separate decisions . 
27996:88	###Well they would n't need them anyway . ###No . 
28049:17	###And it was a wicked cowardice thing that ever happened ###at the time virtually everybody 
28057:53	###I knew that it was the most wrong and wicked thing to do ###Yeah . 
28231:11	###Well this is a disease due to another exotoxin which , in practical terms is of importance to you because it 's the basis for a test for identifying the . ###The toxin may or may not be present in strains of er C diphtheria and this is just an immunological test so I wo wo n't explain it in detail but what you can see is a a strip of er , filter paper which has been bathed in anti-toxin and growth of various different strains of the organism erm which , some of which do produce the toxin you can see lines of precipitation here and some of which do n't produce the toxin . 
28396:23	###There 's nothing we can really do to . ###No . 
28457:18	###Mm . ###and ask about council elections . 
28612:15	###This time , I 'll try and make up minutes and get them out , cos it helps I think . ###Erm Right , well , that 's basically my input except erm Wednesday daytime , what are you doing ? 
28647:34	###Mhm . ###If it 's in the evening I can go . 
28791:8	###Yeah . ###Right . 
28999:153	###Yeah . ###He said he he 'd do it . 
29290:22	###So that you know what we 're off to do . ###Yeah . 
29310:20	###Erm ###Erm 
29314:86	###Erm okay . ###But I will you know 
29345:10	###Well I intend to do . ###Where are you going to be doing that ? 
29383:15	###I 'm willing to take on more . ###If there 's anything you . 
29436:71	###Ah . ###Erm 
29545:14	###Right . ###I 'll do that tomorrow as well . 
29656:101	###Well out there , they 're they 're watching so who else said yes ? ###I 'd feel the local doctors , your local G P 's are needing to be brought more into to line with it . 
29662:7	###Ho and how did you know he was out of date ? ###Because ee er , some of the subjects I brought to him but he did n't know nothing about them ! 
29676:29	###A doctor younger than myself , and I did n't believe him ! ###And , I just tu but there was nothing else I could do ! 
29696:63	###Moods , bad moods and going to I gave my husband a terrible time ! ###I really did ! 
29770:9	###And although it will grea , greatly help some women , unfortunately some women are unable to tolerate it , the side effects it gi , it gives them are worse than the actually symptoms they 're having in the first place . ###It means having periods back again which after , and now , er several years break and erm , many women find unacceptable . 
29775:7	###Yes ? ###Over here ! 
29777:108	###I must admit , after I 'd finished with the menopause I felt absolutely great ! ###I was n't on H R T , I had a very easy transition from having periods to stopping having periods . 
29779:10	###Er , I did go on H R T because of the osteoporosis risk , but I was unlucky I was one of the I think twelve percent who had developed breast trouble and had to come off it . ###I think that er it is probably a very useful thing if you can tolerate it . 
29791:71	###So I mean th the instance of breast cancer is rising the instance of breast cancer , the number of cases of breast is rising , it rises with age . ###Currently , th nu , H R T in this country will not be influencing the risks of breast cancer . 
29840:35	###Now , I 'm not saying I se , but it 's a view that has been put forward , wha wha what do you think of that ? ###Yes ? 
29840:69	###Now , I 'm not saying I se , but it 's a view that has been put forward , wha wha what do you think of that ? ###Yes ? 
29846:7	###for us to prove one way or the other that that , that that they co , the advantages out weigh the disadvantages . ###So you think we have some guinea pigs here ? 
29877:9	###Is it impossible that your sex life might improve after the menopause ? ###I mean I I wo er would anything like to say anything about 
29882:16	###Nelly ? ###Yes I would like to say , it was smashing after the 
29947:10	###I do n't agree with that Sheena ! ###No ! 
29959:17	###As I 've said , I 've been on H R T for three years and , I have since went back to work after being on H R T I do n't think I 'm an old hag ! ###I do n't want to be like a film star , but I do want a better quality of life and I 've got that with H R T ! 
29983:25	###Button one for yes , and button two for no . ###Goodness knows there 's enough of it around in Scotland ! 
29999:14	###The big games are good to watch , they 're quite exciting but week after week you get the English divisions , some of the Scottish divisions and it 's really quite boring ! ###Personally ! 
30024:39	###it . ###Yep ? 
30026:23	###I was going to say , you say you do n't have to watch it , well you want to come and stay in my house ! ###Why ? 
30069:7	###Before we went up to Simpsons . ###Yes ? 
30195:102	###And yet , as er as Linda said women have been playing football for the last seventy , and before that , I mean op , throughout the century women have been playing football ! ###But it 's never really taken off in this country ! 
30276:10	###The er in response to your question about Scotland , I mean I think ###Mhm . 
30294:90	###Right , I 'm very involved in women 's hockey ###Yep . 
30294:112	###Right , I 'm very involved in women 's hockey ###Yep . 
30303:24	###on it 's own . ###Yep . 
30308:36	###Aha . ###man 's game ! 
30449:92	###I was and it 's never gone away even though I 've put my weight back on . ###Yes ? 
30466:27	###Aha . ###when , when the does , when the Twiggys came in and and the , the the angular woman er , of which I am not I wonder if that was the male view or what is the wo , the view that women have of themselves ? 
30490:7	###Now , anorexia is much written and talked about , but perhaps not accurately , how would you define anorexia ? ###I would say that the criteria that 's that 's sent out at the moment is is far too strict for the lot , a lot of women and at the moment you 're expected to be skeletal , whereas th , you can very well be thirteen stone and anorexic it 's , it depends on your attitude towards food . 
30534:37	###Yes . ###Fifteen ? 
30534:69	###Yes . ###Fifteen ? 
30534:104	###Yes . ###Fifteen ? 
30560:35	###Yeah I would class myself as a recovered anorexic , but as recovered as I 'll ever be ! ###I do n't think I 'll ever totally get over it . 
30587:213	###How best can you help someone with a problem like this ? ###It was really , really difficult ! 
30611:18	###I do n't want to give the impression that professionals are unhelpful at all . ###I mean Carole said earlier , it 's a question of eventually making your mind up that you want to do something about it , but then professionals are maybe there to assist . 
30611:73	###I do n't want to give the impression that professionals are unhelpful at all . ###I mean Carole said earlier , it 's a question of eventually making your mind up that you want to do something about it , but then professionals are maybe there to assist . 
30613:83	###What you 've described must be something that erm that that families of people who are suffering from eating disorders must feel very much , that there 's nothing that they can do to , to to help . ###Families feel very rejected by professionals erm , in my research I 've found that er , the families of younger sufferers tend to be involved in treatment but they feel very much that they 're under the microscope , that they disapprove , that they 're seen as being pathological families . 
30633:43	###Erm , I 'd consider myself to have an eating disorder but I do n't have anorexia or bulimia . ###And er , I first started feeling I was overweight when I fourteen and I was , I was twelve stone and I went to the doctor and got black capsules to take which had me as high as a kite for a long time ! 
30644:36	###I could have told you every single item of food I had in the cupboard every , down to the last bean ! ###And now I do n't know . 
30648:78	###I think the lady who said earlier when you go to your G P you ca n't express yourself ###Mm . 
30656:107	###I think it 's very easy to fall into the trap of feeling guilty . ###Mm . 
30678:186	###Yes ? ###I 'd like , I 'd just say that I the the are professionals now that do know more about eating disorders and I do think there are clinics being set up . 
30691:8	###Mm . ###So the media , even when anything you do depends on your size , yo your image is all for a woman , your brain or your ability really comes way down the line ! 
30829:185	###So , I mean a a true real example is you get drunk men in a pub ###Mhm . 
30861:172	###There was one place quite recently ###Mhm . 
30867:140	###Mhm . ###I think it 's really important to er , define this this brief that it 's women responsibility to change men , and to change their sums . 
30867:170	###Mhm . ###I think it 's really important to er , define this this brief that it 's women responsibility to change men , and to change their sums . 
30868:12	###I think it 's really important to er , define this this brief that it 's women responsibility to change men , and to change their sums . ###Because er , inevitably man has gotta leave their home , even if they 've had a father erm who 's been a if they 've had no father at all , they 're gonna leave and they 're gonna face a world where they have to be a man and they 're gonna have to find their own male morals , and I think the , the responsibility , basically , has gotta come to men to change not for us to change them . 
30899:69	###images or whatever , are n't so much to do with misogyny , some horrible male plot , some patriarch or conspiracy , it 's to do with the way our society is run and I think that 's , we look far more at class . ###I feel more allegiance , if you like , with er , a male working class person than I do perhaps with a female member of the class , Margaret Thatcher would be a very good example of that . 
30919:105	###And that is not true ! ###Some men hate some women . 
30921:75	###Yeah , I have worked all my life in various jobs and I 've never yet met a man who hated me nor have I hated any man , and I think there must be many women here who think the same thing . ###So , all men do not hate all women ! 
30973:36	###hate children ! ###They dimi , they hate animals . 
31026:23	###No ! ###But I di 
31048:7	###Can I ask you the same question again ho , after this discussion , do you think men hate women ? ###Button one for yes , and button two for no . 
31159:12	###and is n't it hoped your buying , hope that you will look more beautiful . ###up there 
31196:201	###you know , just to , to keep up with , with the times really . ###mm , mm 
31212:7	###because , you come back here and all the Scottish women were vast and they lost their figure 's and it was just sort of almost taken for granted that you have a baby and you loose your figure , but you do n't mind because you 've got the children . ###yes 
31225:47	###We 've , we 've kind of shied away from the whole thing about image and about fat ###mm 
31278:116	###I just feel I 'm a mother so er all week , and I do n't wear make up all week and I do n't dress up all week just a jeans and a jumper whereas tonight you knew you were coming some where ###yeah 
31463:111	###mm , mm ###she asked for , she should n't of been walking along the street at twelve o' clock and when we have those attitudes at the top of our legal and judicial system its no wonder women blame themselves and indeed maybe blamed . 
31492:28	###I mean I do n't , I wonder , do , do any of you have a gun ? , let me ask you that ###do you , do , do you have a gun ? , button one for yes and button two for no well I 'm not going to ask you to identify yourselves the three of you 
31503:72	###but , but I think that we 'll get into that stage in Britain ###do you ? 
31507:12	###and er , and well , well , one can be abrupt at times and the that could lead ###because er there were n't all that many er available , what , what do you think of , twenty one of you said yes , of the twenty one who said yes are you surprised that the great majority of this hundred women are so unimpressed by , by the courts system , who said yes and would you like to defend your answer ? , yes 
31507:216	###and er , and well , well , one can be abrupt at times and the that could lead ###because er there were n't all that many er available , what , what do you think of , twenty one of you said yes , of the twenty one who said yes are you surprised that the great majority of this hundred women are so unimpressed by , by the courts system , who said yes and would you like to defend your answer ? , yes

31524:199	###Jackie ###So the claims that are made for the good of prison does your not , your not impressed by , well we have to give right of reply to Patricia as you work at Cottonvale . 
31551:135	###Fiat ###Fiat , no Roll 's yet 
31579:112	###tell me more ###better not 
31584:25	###I really do n't like driving , I just think its such a lot of work involved in it ###what sitting there 
31586:74	###yeah , aha , cos you have to concentrate constantly and I think it really is a lot of work involved in it ###yeah , the 
31632:232	###going on public transport and just ###what do you use and where ? 
31636:7	###Now we have n't , erm talking about er cars as to other forms of transport and on the whole there 's been more complaints about the public transport than they have about cars , but you surely do n't think or maybe you do , I mean what 's bad about cars ? , ###I mentioned a couple of things at the start that , er yes . 
31670:26	###because they do it to me so often so I 'm determined their not going to get away first . ###yes 
31689:30	###well its not its ###what are you supposed to do ? 
31689:208	###well its not its ###what are you supposed to do ? 
31751:158	###Public transport could never meet every one 's needs , but it should be seen as a social service and erm we feel that more passes should be issued to people on buses and trains that are disabled or , or the elderly to encourage them to use it more . ###Well we had a secretary of state here who is now minister of transport , I do hope he 's watching this programme seeing as I promised we have had gains and proposals . 
31772:40	###Er yeah , sorry , I write romantic fictions not just lust ###yes 
31797:103	###it is n't always a drastic ending is it ? ###mm , mm 
31801:9	###its definitely not lust ###but 
31801:126	###its definitely not lust ###but 
31828:28	###Yes , one , once the children had gone it was different and I think its , I 'm a widow now and I think love still remains somewhere . ###up there 
31831:56	###mm , mm ###and that 's the basis , if you like them they 'll become your best friend , there 's times you do n't love them , but you still like them 
31855:154	###things , people read them because they want to enjoy them , they know that real life 's different , but its fun . ###but your a writer , yes 
31866:19	###Well actually I think your quite right , but I think the problem is that the older reader reads it for escapism and enjoyment , its , its fun , but I think the younger reader reads it and thinks that 's what life is should be like and that 's when the trouble starts . ###Is this your problem ? , is this why you ended up with a 
31876:38	###mm , mm ###I think that 's important . 
31895:19	###No I quite agree , I also agree with the lady who said that one of the important things is that you like the person , I well speaking from experience , I started out liking somebody ###mm , mm 
31979:40	###Is there advertising for a partner I mean is it , ca n't , does it come under trade description act ? ###can they be , can they be sued afterwards 
32024:31	###in the sick childrens which we do ###Mhm . 
32033:166	###to go running around looking for help . ###I have looked after my husband for seven years , he had a brain tumour operation nearly eight years ago , and he 's in a wheelchair he ca n't walk , but his , after the first two years of caring for him , he 's become bright enough to do the Daily Telegraph crossword , and so he 's er erm brain 's alright . 
32059:17	###So did anybody else have that experience of of of caring for children and parents , or or parents-in-law at the same time ? ###Yes ? 
32080:73	###Now the community care legislation says that carers now have a right to ask for their needs to be assessed , I think that 's very important ! ###Many carers , I have heard say , time and time again , that they feel guilty even asking they did n't even know they had a right to ask , well this legislation now allows people to ask , does n't mean to say their needs are gonna be met , but at least it gives them a right to ask .

32082:15	###It says that they have a right to have their own needs assessed , the wishes of the family and other carers erm , have to be taken into account carers have to be involved in drawing up local plans ###Mhm . 
32115:49	###upon them . ###They 're very often , er a worker they 're a wife , and they 're a mother and all that that contains er , the basics , the shopping , the cleaning , the cooking the decorating , they cut the lawn , they wash the cars , they pay the household accounts . 
32124:37	###Mm . ###for people who are caring for their , their family we 've , we 've also said , that employers should recognise that people should be able to get , erm some kind of leave occasionally from their work er , perhaps ten days a year when they find the person they 're looking after is is sick . 
32145:36	###Yeah . ###me . 
32157:234	###Mm mm . ###Mm ! 
32215:10	###And that is why , th with the government talking about , and they 're talking about authority why should they be looking for money from anywhere , when after all , the youth of today are the pensioners to , of tomorrow , and it 's only our duty to look after them . ###Mhm . 
32243:48	###But ###look after whoever it is they 're looking after . 
32263:60	###and I , I mean I , I think we 've heard earlier a lot o , people who , people who 've who have become carers because they need that , they need to care for somebody , and they want that dimension in their life . ###What 's also come out very strongly er , in this programme is is that it 's a struggle for a lot of people , both financially , and in terms of juggling time and the multiple demands that particularly women have , in trying to care for young people and old people to the point where women may spend their entire lives between , between twenty and sixty looking after somebody or other .

32282:193	###Yes ? ###I 'd like to end on a , on a slightly different note . 
32286:4	###I I think it 's quite wrong er , the way the elderly are treated , that they ###Yeah . 
32336:15	###They can see parents falling out and learning to compromise and become friends again and that helps them , in turn , to create a good marriage . ###Mhm . 
32369:42	###Who said no ? ###Mhm . 
32377:31	###And he knows exactly what his father , and he wants to see him he can go . ###Mhm . 
32448:36	###on my own , brought them from Canada and I brought them up without any help from my ex-husband and I would n't of wanted it any other way . ###Why ? 
32535:37	###Er , but having said that I mean I have a sweet five year old daughter and I would n't change her for anything , but given the second chance I would n't do it again . ###How do you know you do n't have the ability to be a good mother ? 
32550:22	###But I mean as any adoptive parent here will tell you , the strains when you adopt a child , or adopt children , very disturbed children are much worse ! ###And yet , I would do it again . 
32619:43	###er ###our royalty is erm we sort of put on a pedestal and if you look at other European countries who still have royal families , they 're a bit more down to earth , some of them Europe go on bicycles and they do n't need , erm , all the limousines . 
32706:75	###And somebody with his influence and power , it 's good to have him on our side , as it were . ###Rhona ? 
32709:82	###some countries ! ###Erm a , th th the situ , you know the situation abo , about about charity , charity we 've we 've seen it all before and it has n't helped the starving millions in Africa , it 's beginning to start all over again . 
32737:43	###I do n't ! ###Yes ? 
32738:174	###Yes ? ###I think to have a classless society in this country everybody has to be equal and not just from the rich to the poor and the poor to the rich , but also there 's many people in this country who suffer from persecution . 
32739:53	###I think to have a classless society in this country everybody has to be equal and not just from the rich to the poor and the poor to the rich , but also there 's many people in this country who suffer from persecution . ###Now , there 's been lots of talk about gay and lesbian people not having no rights , I come from a Jewish society , I 've got people who suffer anti-semitic ri , feelings , there 's lot of erm multi-ra , ethnic majorities who cover on this programme , and I think that issue has to be looked at as well . 
32761:22	###they 're born into it , they have this position . ###They were born into it and Americas does n't have a monarchy . 
32791:17	###They do not need to go erm and th th they they have their own positions and I think a lot of what they speak is of genuine concern . ###Rhona . 
32791:165	###They do not need to go erm and th th they they have their own positions and I think a lot of what they speak is of genuine concern . ###Rhona . 
32805:70	###Yeah but I agree totally with what , and the other lady has just said , but the other thing is is the amount of money that is spent when , you know , someone royal is coming for a visit because all of a sudden , you know , you have people in this country who are living in absolute poverty and yet because the royal sort of erm limousine is going past erm , for a few seconds where they stay all of a sudden the front of the house is painted ! ###And there was an instance a few years ago I think where they were going somewhere in Glasgow and a toilet was put in 
32812:65	###Mm mm . ###worth a lick of paint ? 
32820:93	###I could n't understand that at all ! ###Moira ? 
32883:21	###Lack of money . ###Lack of money . 
32948:99	###Doing something you like , if you can give yourself half an hour , or an hour , you know just say this is for me , and for me only . ###Mm mm . 
32964:7	###Yes ? ###I think it 's important to get a listening ear and know that there are other people around who will give you support . 
33040:38	###Mm . ###There . 
33046:36	###Well I , I went to a psychiatrist once looking for a self-help group cos I did n't want tablets or anything I just wanted somebody I could talk to . ###Mhm . 
33099:9	###Mhm . ###to look at er , a P R job about changing the way those resources are used so that they 're used in the way that 's been talked away , er , talked about tonight which is way that clearly many wo , many women want to see them being used . 
33116:148	###Mm . ###Well , no not cope but to 
33196:19	###Yes ? ###I 'm not married and do n't have any children and I would love to have children and if I found out that I could n't have any I would do anything to have them . 
33196:109	###Yes ? ###I 'm not married and do n't have any children and I would love to have children and if I found out that I could n't have any I would do anything to have them . 
33202:20	###Yes ? ###Well I feel it 's the right of every woman that wants a baby to know what it 's like to hold her own baby in her own arms . 
33240:56	###Mhm . ###and , a relationship built up , especially between myself and the surrogate and life was devastated when we parted and my daughter will always know how much her genetic mother loves her and how much I love her obviously . 
33277:46	###So , in the first place it 's selfish , second place , or maybe the first place , it 's unnatural and who are , who are they thinking about ? ###They want a baby they 're not concerned whether it 's going to have spina-bifida or have som , they are looking forward for a perfect baby . 
33402:57	###No . ###Yes ? 
33420:50	###So you did feel a great urge to to conceive or bear a child yourself ? ###No , I mean , strangely enough that was one of the things that almost put me off the relationship in the first place because I 'd never had any desire to be a mother . 
33444:145	###What right does that child have ? ###Up there . 
33470:184	###Because I think it 's ironic a lot of what 's come out of this discussion tonight is that we 're actually considering relationships which are treasons , fundamentals ###Mm . 
33486:19	###I think it 's a privilege to have children , it 's a tremendous duty but I 'm concerned about the children . ###Now , you 're ! 
33603:29	###Under the nineteen eighty six act ###Mm . 
33629:67	###I do not think that research has gone as fast as it should ! ###Mhm . 
33637:116	###th th the , the veterinary side ? ###Mhm . 
33744:55	###Mm . ###do n't have great lumps made to grown on us , we do n't go through she , severe pain . 
33798:19	###Yes ? ###Beside you . 
33798:33	###Yes ? ###Beside you . 
33847:45	###I 'd like to disagree with that . ###Ah . 
33850:75	###We had a new ###Mm . 
33856:22	###Yes . ###what do you do now with the , what do the old the old hunt 's people do ? 
33899:18	###Mm . ###that hunting justifies the the end of killing foxes but it does preserve country life . 
34072:210	###But , now that , I mean I 'm in the second year of being a student , and I took on the position of women 's officer for the we , for the west of Scotland area ###Mhm . 
34106:15	###Yep ? ###Na , I mean answered a yes to that question , but I do n't think it 's a matter of do you want or do you no , cos I do n't think the choice is there . 
34189:25	###The words the , I mean it has always been stigmatized by men , lesbians , and , you know everything ###Mhm . 
34211:46	###History . ###Yes ? 
34277:175	###I love Scotland and I would n't leave . ###Par partly because I 'd get homesick , and I just love the whole of Scotland ! 
34289:42	###Yes ? ###That 's a very important point ! 
34313:40	###and although things may not be brilliant for , in the workplace at the moment , but we 're we 're making a move , we 're getting a , a foot in there . ###In years to come they 're gonna be the managers so hopefully we can make it better for someone else . 
34341:8	###Mhm . ###I love it because it 's Christian and Christmas to me is basically a traditional Christian festival , and that 's the part of it that I enjoy . 
34438:66	###everybody here will be aware of that , turning the house inside out , erm , getting rid of of all the old things and I ###Mhm . 
34489:16	###Yes ! ###days . 
34701:127	###Yes ? ###Yes . 
34719:42	###We can be managers now ###Mhm . 
34863:10	###Did put on weight ? ###Yes . 
34877:36	###Amanda ? ###Yes . 
35027:19	###No . ###It 's not . 
35061:52	###What we 're saying it is your choice , knowing the dangers to smoke or not to smoke . ###I believe the young , young lady over in the other side , really told the truth , more of the truth than perhaps anyone else she said she liked it . 
35062:9	###I believe the young , young lady over in the other side , really told the truth , more of the truth than perhaps anyone else she said she liked it . ###Now , I know many pe , persons who have liked smoking but who have to , for some reason or other , maybe raised blood pressure , to give up and they have managed to do it and quite easily , because they have desperately wanted to . 
35100:17	###I think another erm aspect about smoking is , I 'm not a smoker , but I often wonder if er , smokers feel used by the amount of taxation on cigarettes ? ###Er , you know , they 're actually paying money to the government every time they buy and every budget day the cigarettes go up . 
35112:74	###because it 's a lot easier for a government to say if you stop smoking it 'll be alright , than to deal with things like poverty . ###Mhm . 
35232:111	###Oh certainly ! ###Yes , yes . 
35281:9	###We found that a lot of young couples that because you do n't go to church on a regular basis but erm , to go along with their parents ' wishes too , rather than going through a big church wedding in a church , they go to a hotel and they have the erm , wedding ceremony and the reception all in the hotel , and are married by a minister . ###And that 
35293:58	###We were married at home , and one of the reasons why is because we bought a very old house about three years ago and on the top floor it has a , a large room which used to be the ballroom , and we did a little research and we found that the last wedding that we know of in the house took place in seventeen fifty eight , when apparently it was very common in Scotland to get married at home , it was more uncommon to go to church . ###Mm . 
35320:130	###Not me personally but I have known a few people who 've wanted perhaps , a very quiet wedding , just in a registry office , and finished up with a large church wedding . ###Mm . 
35323:15	###Hannah ? ###I was just going to say that being a photographer , we find that more and more people come with their mothers instead of the fiance whenever they 're going to get married , and it is all the time , the mother has a big say in it you know , instead of the couple . 
35324:49	###I was just going to say that being a photographer , we find that more and more people come with their mothers instead of the fiance whenever they 're going to get married , and it is all the time , the mother has a big say in it you know , instead of the couple . ###Well now , there must be some mothers here who er 
35325:7	###Well now , there must be some mothers here who er ###Any mothers who 've married off their daughters in this dictatorial way , saying you must have this dress ! 
35429:238	###I think that these inflated ideas perhaps come with the old language of the church , and if you 're going to do that well then , all hail to you and er presumably you mean it if you 've gone there . ###There are people who come from from different cultures amongst this hundred who might want to say something about erm , wedding ceremonies . 
35430:11	###There are people who come from from different cultures amongst this hundred who might want to say something about erm , wedding ceremonies . ###I got married twenty three years ago in China , well , we just invite er , invited er our friends , and er former school mates to ma , to my home and we did n't make any vow , er we just gave a banquet to the friends , and er , in China people now can get married in many ways and er some foreigners have come to China to get married in a traditional Chinese way , and they have to er , carry their bride in a sedan chair .

35450:102	###That 's one to remember , I did n't understand what I was saying ! ###Yes ? 
35468:77	###When you come from a big family , as I do , erm yo you can have any size of wedding as long as the right people are there , anybody gets excluded it 's er to be horrendous ! ###Mm . 
35474:12	###Is a honeymoon a good way to start a marriage ? ###Button one for yes , and button two for no . 
35476:10	###You do n't have to have had one to be able to comment on this . ###And , seventy seven people say yes , and twenty three people say no , and are n't you fascinated to know why they voted that way ? 
35571:15	###There . ###Oh , erm , I just want to say how can a four or five year old er , understand the concepts and the emotions involved in sexual relationships ? 
35589:17	###But do n't you ###an awful lot from teachers , you know , we 're just expecting that they know everything about sex education . 
35669:29	###Mhm . ###never come into it . 
35739:82	###No , we had five sa , boys no mixed . ###Do you think ma , do you think maybe that 's , that 's one of the answers , to separate the sexes for , for these discussions or 
35756:13	###I ###Mm . 
35756:35	###I ###Mm . 
35757:29	###Mm . ###think there has to be a er family planning centres have to more on the street , I think family planning clinics have got the people there who are able to go out on the street . 
35765:16	###to prevent pregnancy , or any other disease for that matter . ###And I think that 's something 
35765:100	###to prevent pregnancy , or any other disease for that matter . ###And I think that 's something 
35829:100	###I think they should get rid of the stigma in condoms , cos what frightens me is that in about ten years time my daughter will come and maybe ask if she can go on the pill and at least I can tell her no , use a condom there 's less chance of sexually transmitted diseases , but it 's my sons they wo n't come and ask . ###Yes ? 
35863:44	###Put against the letters that I wrote they 've all been sent out . ###I 've actually got thirty one copies of at the moment . 
35935:88	###I think someone 's already John ! ###Maybe you 'll like this one ? 
36012:15	###Presumably the temperatures are too . ###But , one of things that we are discovering is that when people complain about drafts er , we 've been switching the air conditioning up and down to balance it up to suit the individuals needs .

36088:103	###Mm . ###in there . 
36171:9	###But erm I th they are worried certainly , one or two of them are worried , but er some of this equipment is left on , and left on unnecessarily and we ought to be encouraging people to switch off what is n't ###That 's right . 
36184:20	###Assume the responsibility ? ###But , other than that , yeah I think you 're right . 
36185:33	###But , other than that , yeah I think you 're right . ###Presumably with an arrow , you have to Mark , Mark . 
36407:151	###depends when it happens , I mean we we 're still waiting to find out where some of the changes , erm in terms of layouts and the like are gonna be done . ###Erm , but following on from that , wherever we change layouts now we try and be very specific about organizing the cable management up front and , so that they do n't present any hassles . 
36426:15	###Erm , the cables ? ###I , I ca n't comment specifically to that . 
36449:73	###Mhm . ###making sure they 're safe , even though they 'll still be , sort of , visually erm they 'll be seen , erm they 'll be actually tidied on the desk . 
36467:95	###Okay . ###Well clearly , we need to you know , the long term moves which we you 're obviously taking of in terms of the long running programmes is fine . 
36654:167	###Jonathan ! ###What , you want one ? 
36655:112	###What , you want one ? ###I 've got nothing other , I do n't know whether anybody 's aware of what went on last Wednesday and probably that , I mean there could have been there was a , sort of a , a cable that , a mains cable that heated up and started smoking and er , we had to deal with that . 
36717:38	###Erm , but obviously if somebody can take some assertive action that stops the fire ###Yeah . 
36786:126	###It 's a good point there ! ###Develop a procedure for out of hours then . 
36816:242	###Mm . ###That 's a good point ! 
36911:24	###And , we 're becoming more and more stringent on where people pile boxes and other various items of rubbish . ###Erm but we need to get some plans up together . 
37083:48	###Er the I know this is basically not iron and steel but if you take the Mediterranean er very loosely ###That 's Italy and er the home of the Mafia , there 's Greece and Turkey and so on and you come back round again , there 's the Straits of Gibraltar . 
37085:19	###In the early days of er navigation within the Mediterranean people used to actually have to navigate by going all the way round the coast . ###So if you wanted to go from there to there you went all round that way . 
37142:37	###The er coke is produced from the coal and the coal gas that 's driven off is then used for heating and powering things elsewhere in the steel works . ###So we have two things , we 've got iron ore , coke . 
37197:12	###Now if you have silicon in your steel it becomes very brittle and useless . ###For example if you think of the Vauxhall Cavalier advert where they 're crashing these Cavaliers all over the place , if you had a silicone er a silicon-based steel instead of crumpling nicely the steel would actually crack and break . 
37218:9	###scoop off . ###But they do n't actually scoop it out off from the blast furnace , they drill a hole in the side where they 've plugged it with a lump of clay . 
37719:10	###Well haemoglobin is ###Haemoglobin is the red colouring compound that carries the oxygen and gives the red cells their colour . 
37860:29	###So you do n't get bacon and eggs er floating round your bloodstream . ###So for that to happen for that food to be converted into a form that your body can use it 's got to be broken down . 
37862:21	###Broken down in your liver , and your liver has to do work . ###Yes ? 
37953:7	###If you then get it a second time you will then possibly have an allergic reaction to the horse serum . ###Now you do n't get tetanus cards to carry because you 've not had the horse serum . 
38020:38	###That 's ###Ugh 
38033:54	###there continuously . ###Well the answer is you 'd go stark staring raving mad . 
38242:104	###Each driver . ###Each driver . 
38415:61	###Yeah . ###mainly for the boy at the back . 
38440:17	###This guy when he the policeman spoke to him afterwards , his words to the policeman Now let 's bear in mind he might have been in shock . ###His words to the policeman were I like driving fast do n't I ? 
38452:36	###Yeah . ###Mm . 
38483:53	###The attitude of the driver . ###Bit too fast , bit too blase , whatever the case may be . 
38483:87	###The attitude of the driver . ###Bit too fast , bit too blase , whatever the case may be . 
38491:58	###The end result might only be a slight scratch , but the potential might have been in that situation for something a lot worse . ###So it 's it 's always there . 
38501:7	###You probably know a few . . ###What are you looking at me for ? 
38518:15	###The o ###What was that Dougie ? 
38631:96	###And if you 've got somebody right up your bum keep further space so that you can lead them into a situation safely , as opposed to sort of having a anchor on yourself . ###Now i it 's the sort of thing that you y you read about , you pick up the the paper , you put n news on , and Nasty accident on the M Eight or M Six , whatever the case may be , and a lot of vehicles are involved . 
38632:51	###Now i it 's the sort of thing that you y you read about , you pick up the the paper , you put n news on , and Nasty accident on the M Eight or M Six , whatever the case may be , and a lot of vehicles are involved . ###So the lesson to be learnt from that is that erm it 's not always possible to keep yourself out of trouble , but you can do what you have to do to keep yourself safe by maintaining a proper separation distance . 
38685:65	###And yet people you see them , lorry drivers and car drivers , but lorry drivers themselves , they 're happy to go along the road at fifty sixty miles an hour with such a short distance between themselves and the vehicle in front . ###And the thing is when these sort of trailers and boxes like you 've got on there , you just ca n't see . 
38758:4	###Oh we 're just just getting into four gear now I think . ###Now there 're the lorries , and the see the N F T just up there going round the bend . 
38764:20	###The hard shoulder . ###Now as he comes in front of that lorry back onto the carriageway , if the one that was over taking suddenly decides to pull back in his mate having flashed him , the value of a nearside mirror ? 
39106:9	###No . ###No . 
39247:65	###You can work on a presumption , a prebonderance of probabilities or whatever , but I mean what you cannot do is take it that it 's absolutely fact that that is going to happen . ###So always work out in your mind that nobody has right of way in those circumstances . 
39265:92	###Stan , just st still on the question of roundabouts and the vexed question of mini-roundabouts , you know these dots in the middle of the the the of junctions . ###Yes . 
39313:7	###They 're not always straight forward . ###So if you 're gonna turn left do n't give a signal there , you 're gonna turn left in there . 
39318:7	###It 's too late . ###They do n't know what you intend to do and what you 've actually done . 
39320:9	###You must give other drivers , and riders , time to absorb the information that you 're giving them . ###Your signal is the only voice you 've got , apart from the horn , is the only voice you 've got at telling them what you intend to do . 
39412:153	###But round the corner there are side roads . ###But they would insist on parking on the footpath . 
39416:27	###I E you get a blind person come along . ###Erm you get a a woman with a pram . 
39431:38	###They still go through there at . ###I know . 
39435:9	###And it 's always parked on the footpath . ###And there was a traffic warden standing there doing a traffic er doing a fixed penalty ticket . 
39497:23	###Have I got to sit behind this chap for ages ? ###You can overtake on a double white line . 
39589:7	###Erm ###Whee ! 
39656:7	###Yes . ###three bands . 
39862:8	###Right . ###Er 
39921:26	###As always . ###Oh yes . 
40028:18	###Erm ###Well we could , but if we get too many we can go into business selling them or something . 
40216:19	###But I 'd prefer to get ASCII files ###Yeah . 
40228:37	###Erm we 've done mileage and expenses claim forms and given you the bits and pieces . ###Mhm . 
40669:77	###Congratulations . ###Thank you . . 
40675:59	###Er I was still slobbing around in my dressing-gown and you know yesterday 's clothes and so I I I thought I 'd better get up and do stuff . ###. Erm yeah . 
40786:52	###Mm . ###or phone the Conference Centre . 
40857:10	###Oh yeah ! ###I mean what a hassle . 
40885:23	###Yeah . ###S as Spike knows , about phoning places that I where I do n't recognize the number and asking them who the fuck they are and when he called them . . 
40907:10	###Erm erm I did and try and use ###I do n't know it . 
40964:36	###Yeah . ###where he talks to people about setting up his business is a legitimate thing to record . 
41073:10	###Little Nick . ###Erm 
41097:24	###You can be bored about it when you type the tape . ###Yeah . 
41127:12	###Anyway yes , Whit 's going to us at some stage and I will wander round town while he 's doing his talk and then transcribe it ###Right . 
41241:26	###You walk around stepping . ###Yeah . 
41587:9	###Ooh that 's something ###Erm 
41935:8	###So these are that 's how you use aromatherapy . ###And it help it does n't say it 'll definitely cure you of anything , but it will help maybe to alleviate some problems . 
41942:12	###And all the oils at the bottom the blue ones are to make you refreshed , happy , revived , we hope . ###So if you ever go in and you want to have a oil that relaxes you , you look at all the red ones . 
41945:7	###Also with essential oils , they come from plants , leaves , twigs , roots , er parts of flowers and plants . ###If you were to use essential oil neat , that 's the little drops of oil , it 's too strong and it will h Well it wo n't harm you but it wo n't it might set up irritations . 
41947:7	###You must always mix it with an oil . ###And if you went say to ' s where they sell essential oils , theirs are pure oils . 
42124:10	###And of course with Body Shop it 's more environmentally easy to get . ###Yes . 
42149:44	###And tried to get ###And all you got was a rotting mess . 
42249:5	###Mm . ###It 's probably a knock-on effect . 
42299:9	###Because the language changes all the time , ###Right . 
42327:42	###Yeah there 's that maths paper . ###Okay . 
42415:21	###So I measured that , it was about five centimetres . ###Right . 
42616:74	###Right . ###right . 
42750:73	###Yeah . ###Erm probably on this and on this one . 
42894:17	###Okay . ###Thanks very much . 
43228:59	###Now you can choose these erm slightly differently . ###For example you 've got lots of got lots of minuses in . 
43652:12	###That 's a much more accurate way of finding the gradient . ###Just find the tan of the angle . 
43970:22	###Right . ###Now what what were the bits that were a bit tricky then ? 
44534:147	###Carbon dioxide ###Hydrogen . 
44534:174	###Carbon dioxide ###Hydrogen . 
44576:59	###Erm it wants to be a Z N double positive and go with the sulphate ###Yeah . 
44576:62	###Erm it wants to be a Z N double positive and go with the sulphate ###Yeah . 
44787:40	###And it will put out a glowing splint or something . ###So if there w well we 've got to get carbon dioxide out of this somehow cos we know carbon dioxide is given off . 
44935:9	###I got I got carbon dioxide given off ###Yeah . 
44937:7	###so it must have been ? ###Erm a carbonate . 
44937:24	###so it must have been ? ###Erm a carbonate . 
44937:95	###so it must have been ? ###Erm a carbonate . 
45015:101	###Yeah . ###but if once you can see it as a pattern , all this lot fit together and you 're not If you learn those four reactions separately a month apart or something yeah ? 
45051:89	###You 've got no chance of making C O three out of that you have n't got the C anywhere . ###Yeah . 
45080:77	###Yeah . ###So with this system you 'll remember bits , you 'll forget bits , the bits you do n't remember you can now work them out from the patterns . 
45349:126	###and everywhere you 've got an a C A you could put an M G and everything would fit because it 's C A double positive M G double positive . ###Right . 
45371:14	###Okay . ###That 's the big point there . 
45401:29	###Erm okay that 's great . ###Now erm at the moment I 've got a lot to fit in 
45544:179	###Okay ? ###Mm . 
45563:8	###Before you can become a police er dog handler ###Yeah . 
45563:46	###Before you can become a police er dog handler ###Yeah . 
45572:12	###Alright ? ###You then work with your dog the whole time and all the time you 're working with your dog , naturally enough , it 's a young dog , so you 're being tested and evaluated the whole time , so your training continues . 
45626:10	###I then was sent a letter telling me that I 'd passed this exam , I then had what 's known as a medical to check that I was okay , there was no , I had no faults or injuries or health problems . ###I then did a physical which they made me run a mile and a half , did press ups , sit ups , which I passed . 
45630:73	###I 'm sorry ###Interview . 
45632:15	###Thank you , the in after the interview I went back to Chelmsford where is the headquarters of the Essex Police Force and had to do a course for two weeks . ###After I did the course for two weeks I went down to a place in Ashford and I was in Ashford for twelve weeks , came back to Chelmsford , did another two weeks and then I was released as what 's known as probationer constable , a probationer constable . 
45663:176	###What is it like in court ? ###What is it like in court . 
45665:49	###Right there are two kinds of courts that policemen , well there 's several kinds of court , but the main courts that policemen go to are a magistrate 's court where there is what 's known as , they are magistrates or JPs , Justice of the Peace , and they sit there and you have to give evidence . ###That 's quite scary . 
45745:16	###Oh have you ? ###What 's your question ? 
45746:12	###What 's your question ? ###Erm why do you have to be strong to be a policeman ? 
45747:12	###Erm why do you have to be strong to be a policeman ? ###You do n't have to be strong to be a policeman . 
45761:8	###You have n't got it . ###You have n't got it , exactly . 
45847:9	###Too long , waste too much time . ###Yes ? 
45874:16	###Yeah . ###I 've done that and that is n't very nice . 
45875:29	###I 've done that and that is n't very nice . ###I went , I had to tell a lady that her husband had died er about two Christmases ago , two days before Christmas . 
45876:7	###I went , I had to tell a lady that her husband had died er about two Christmases ago , two days before Christmas . ###Her husband died in a car accident and I had to go and tell his wife . 
45889:57	###fire first , sometimes the police , if it 's a really serious fire , get there first but the real professionals when it comes to a fire are the Fire Brigade . ###So if the lady was on fire , you 'd leave it basically to the Fire Brigade , obviously if you could help the lady , get a ladder up to the window to get her out of the room or something like that , you would do that , you would help in any way you can , but the real experts are the Fire Brigade so we leave all the er real technical stuff to the Fire Brigade . 
45897:121	###I 've been to a fire where there was a huge black cloud coming out of a , a flat ###That 's what happened to me 
45921:29	###Shh shh . ###Right so that 's what I thought , we could s collect some police words now , alright ? 
46425:28	###which is for local and one in the car which is county wide , which can cover the whole of Essex , yeah ? ###Not on them little boxes . 
46433:37	###Right that 's , that 's , you see you 're getting ###the American stuff but when you 're arrested you are always arrested on suspicion because in this country you are innocent until a cou a court proves you 're i er guilty , yeah ? 
46446:20	###But I still ca n't make him guilty . ###Only a judge and a jury can make him guilty . 
46461:103	###They 're , they 're like a long stick with a handle on them are n't they ? ###Yeah . 
46468:7	###Are you allowed to use bulletproof jackets , yes . ###I would n't use a bulletproof , well in certain circumstances I might , but I 'm not trained to carry a firearm so I would n't use a I , hopefully , I wo n't get selected to go into a house where I need to wear a bulletproof uniform . 
46538:9	###Yeah , he , he ###it was literally b literally like going up to the shop and buying a newspaper . 
46622:39	###Right . ###Fair enough . 
46634:24	###Yes . ###Me . 
46643:21	###I can be put in jail , yeah . ###Exactly the same . 
46768:17	###Elephant . ###I know ! 
47548:18	###Yeah ? ###You 've had this video now and I 've come to this school since you started this school , so you should know more about Stranger Danger than other schools cos I keep coming every year and talking to you about it . 
47642:17	###Done it . ###Sh Now in order to help this black powder to split up the acid . 
47656:44	###The gas can you can you set fire to it ? ###No it 's not a flammable gas . 
47699:28	###Cos we 've got a tap funnel . ###so if there 's any gas 
47788:9	###Well well did anything happen when I put the acid in ? ###Did any any of you three see what anything that happened in the first one . 
47898:36	###It does but it might also do the gas might do something else as well . ###Turn the water green . 
47912:43	###With a tap . ###And then once all the acid was in if you left the tape open what would happen to the gas ? 
47960:44	###It it 's a bit misty alright fair enough that 's a property . ###Anything else ? 
47962:45	###If it can fall down out of that pipe into the jar it must be ? ###Very good be heavy . 
48019:67	###You 've got au movement tres modere which means in French at the original speed very moderate again of course okay ? ###En retenant jusque a la pas number seven there getting slower right up to the end very obviously . 
48053:7	###Question five asks you to fill in the rhythm of the music in bar ten . ###Look at bar ten it 's at the end of that statement un peu movemente mais tres peu You 'll see you 've got the note heads given . 
48055:12	###You have to fill in the rhythm . ###You will need to copy those note heads onto manuscript paper and put em in . 
48056:9	###You will need to copy those note heads onto manuscript paper and put em in . ###You do n't have to complete bar nine even though bar nine is empty because that 's the subject of question four what happens there . 
48057:7	###You do n't have to complete bar nine even though bar nine is empty because that 's the subject of question four what happens there . ###So you have to describe that in words . 
48064:15	###Where there 's like a little comma . ###Well that could be the answer . 
48065:12	###Well that could be the answer . ###You are gonna have to say though . 
48068:15	###You can see there 's a gap there under the word ceder . ###So I suggest you actually copy the first three notes of bar fifteen and then put the rest in correctly . 
48110:80	###If you have n't done that yet do it now because the practice of writing it of actually copying it down is important . ###Why though ? 
48156:50	###I 've got three there I 've got one two three ###Oh I see well you 've got ' em you 've that 's why you put em diagonal you see so that they really do show up against the 
48297:7	###If there is to be a fairly detailed piece of note writing it very often is a fairly near or an exact copy of something that 's already gone before . ###Of course you ca n't put the tails hanging down on bar ten can you . 
48299:12	###You have to put them up because the notes are on or below the middle line . ###Think think think . 
48313:21	###You can think very hard where the player takes a breath . ###Twelve thirteen . 
48448:11	###So erm may maybe we should look at the surveying , land management bit ###Yeah . 
48451:87	###But erm my understanding of erm gaining a surveying qualification ###Mhm . 
48528:17	###Erm yeah ###course . 
48554:41	###Mm . ###do the correspondence course . 
48558:25	###you know because there 's no sort of backup really I mean alright ###No . 
48675:7	###then you know I 'm not sure either whether of course I mean one would hope that erm the institute would have certain requirements about the erm practical period that you ###Yeah . 
48706:17	###Well they should ###Erm . 
48790:18	###Well they they 're very interested in that because ###Yeah . 
48865:11	###And erm the the the erm scheme is that the government pays the interest while you 're on the course ###Right yes . 
48926:8	###finally working up and ###Yeah and and 
48993:52	###erm I was slowly sort of pulling a few ideas out of thin air . ###And 
48993:82	###erm I was slowly sort of pulling a few ideas out of thin air . ###And 
48997:60	###You know if that was only way to get qualified . ###Yeah . 
49254:104	###So we 've found the other bit on our graph now . ###We know that up there it goes to nine thousand five hundred and along here it gets to ninety five thousand . 
49336:29	###If we join , we 've got three points now once we know it 's a straight line , three points is enough . ###Two is enough really but just to be on the safe side use three and if they do n't all lie in the same straight line then one of them 's wrong . 
49337:36	###Two is enough really but just to be on the safe side use three and if they do n't all lie in the same straight line then one of them 's wrong . ###You do n't know which one you 'd have to check all of them again . 
49428:40	###So let 's try another one and I 'll give you some of the details and the questions that I 'm going to ask on it later . ###Now with this one the one we 've just done you do n't really know how far to go I mean I might have been going to ask erm how long has he been travelling if he 's been riding for a thousand hours . 
49515:53	###That sort of question . ###You still think it 's 
49527:53	###Or how much would it weigh if we put ten engines on ? ###Now when you see the equation like that , the one that 's on the left hand side . 
49608:80	###Nothing . ###Right . 
49739:17	###Ah what it is I want to find W so I can find that axis as well what ###Okay . 
50082:51	###Yeah . ###there 's always something on graphs . 
50082:67	###Yeah . ###there 's always something on graphs . 
50155:12	###So if you do just measure the angle they say , Find the gradient and erm find the the angle . ###and you ca n't just measure it . 
50196:19	###And after a while you say cupboard . ###Like forehead . 
50301:113	###Have you ever spelt it before ? ###No . 
50302:11	###No . ###See so it 's just by learning the pattern it 's like say if you were you were playing football every time somebody every time the ball came towards you you had to learn all about the way the ball goes Oh it 's you know it 's slowing down cos the grass is wet and it 's curling and things like that . 
50407:28	###The only trouble is the teachers keep giving you all the awkward one do n't they everybody ###Yeah . 
50498:43	###but it 'll mean you can get a lot of them . ###most of the I Es . 
50797:20	###And will I get three out of a pound ? ###Is a pound enough to get Lion bars ? 
50822:12	###Oh yeah . ###just write twenty thirty . 
50826:36	###Right ###Yeah now take twelve away from the twenty right twelve underneath it and take it away . 
50887:33	###holidays ###Okay now 
50903:15	###Yeah . ###Okay so you could do all of those 
50930:158	###You can spell box , you can spell ox . ###Yeah ? 
51092:12	###and I mean I 'd love the Bluecoat but I mean you 've got to be pretty clever for that . ###But you never you never know . 
51092:32	###and I mean I 'd love the Bluecoat but I mean you 've got to be pretty clever for that . ###But you never you never know . 
51111:7	###Their exam is more or less G C S E for eleven year olds you know ###Really ? 
51112:18	###Really ? ###they have to be very good just to get in yeah . 
51342:20	###Yeah . ###Or if you 're going to do it the same as we 've done these it should be S A Y E D so said is a funny one . 
51349:26	###Mm . ###So for most of them strayed prayed stayed played you can just put E D . 
51620:134	###Like ###Yeah just like . 
51719:43	###You had back . ###Erm 
51721:10	###If you were going on holiday before you went you 'd probably have to . ###Very good . 
51723:10	###You 'd have to put things in your suitcase ###Yeah . 
51723:39	###You 'd have to put things in your suitcase ###Yeah . 
51723:53	###You 'd have to put things in your suitcase ###Yeah . 
51778:51	###if you have n't if you 're just trying to remember every word there is in the dictionary you 'd be there all your life and you 'd still never remember them all . ###Mm . 
51796:35	###Lick L I C K . ###Good did you know that or were you just guessing ? 
52088:16	###You should never give up or ###You need to have another go maybe sometimes think well what am I doing wrong . 
52456:116	###Those some of those might be a little awkward . ###Erm tables if you learn the tables it 's a lot easier . 
52561:70	###patterns you can make . ###But if you still get through all that and you want to do more try sixty . 
52587:99	###I 've never been last . ###Oh that 's great . 
52627:100	###I 've given him some some things to play he 's going to play with his pennies and make patterns and work out his tables . ###Alright . 
52879:9	###Now let 's say we 've done that we thought there were three people here so you though you were getting a third right . ###And then there were twice s many people there were six people . 
52880:75	###And then there were twice s many people there were six people . ###So you had to share yours with someone else and you just got a sixth okay . 
52949:9	###Let 's have a look that one is a quarter and this one 's a bit bigger . ###A sixth . 
52987:130	###four . ###Four so four twelfths 'd make a third . 
53075:23	###A third . ###Very good very good now a lot of people take a long time to get that . 
53130:72	###A quarter so a sixth and a twelfth makes a quarter ###Quarter . 
53168:22	###And three twelfths is the same as a quarter is n't it . ###We stuck three twelfths together we can make a quarter . 
53169:125	###We stuck three twelfths together we can make a quarter . ###Do this is how we have to add up fractions . 
53344:16	###Okay and how old 's she ? ###Erm eight . 
53348:93	###about this fractions ? ###It 's the same if you 're erm erm tell her the take aways and how many twelfths in like a whole and stuff like that . 
53517:4	###And the one that 's left is ###The adjacent . 
53721:34	###So that will just cancel out and we 'll have that . ###Now we do it to one side of the equation so there that 's one twenty write it out again nought point eight three nine etcetera is equal to opposite divided by a hundred and twenty . 
53734:15	###So that 's the height . ###So the height is a hundred point six nine metres . 
53975:35	###A hundred . ###That 's it . 
54020:33	###Mm . ###It might not be . 
54183:33	###See it 's about like that it 's a little bit It 's it 's ninety and a tiny bit ###Yeah . 
54330:8	###Right . ###Well i that was to sort of try and make you focus on the gifts of the Holy Spirit that we 're going to receive , that we receive through or that you have strengthened through Confirmation , rather than receiving because they 're already there . 
54831:51	###Now this next Sunday you 're preparing and saying Yes I definitely want to go ahead and be confirmed . ###And it it should be your decision . 
54867:101	###Mm mm . ###That 's really up to your parents . 
54924:71	###Okay they 're the main three . ###We 've got pottery , we 've got bones , we 've got buildings , okay . 
54959:15	###Okay , right so we 've cleaned it , now what we gonna do ? ###put it in . 
54968:28	###And that 's what you 're gonna do as soon as you get in there , that 's your first activity . ###You 're gonna be given 
55085:87	###Yes because we very rarely find a whole pot . ###Usually what 's happened is somebody 's been doing the cooking , dropped the pot on the floor , and all the pieces have been thrown away . 
55092:29	###Yeah ? ###Yes , take pictures and draw sketches . 
55108:13	###Yes ? ###Cos something might fall on his head , yes , and he 's also he 's working on a building site and that 's the normal regulations . 
55159:30	###Right , can you do that ? ###Right now the first job that we want you to do is to help us to sort out some of the things . 
55328:11	###And you can just pull it so that it flattens . ###That 's right yes . 
55352:29	###You 've got pottery , you 've got building material such as tile lumps of plaster around somewhere as well , erm shell , bone , all sorts of things , okay . ###So what actually happens , these are taken off-site and they 're washed but they 're not sorted . 
55376:14	###When you 've finished sorting them into their piles , the next job is to put each pile into a separate bag , so that you would put all your bones into one bag , all your pottery into another . ###So these are now ready to go off to the specialists , okay . 
55410:183	###That is an is an original height of the arch cos that arch is keyed into the main arch of the tower . ###But if you look at the next one you see the arches er all the the other arches are have been raised about er a metre , and that was done deliberately to get the extra height on the outside wall so that they could put erm a er er higher roof in for the the knave and for the the aisle so that they could ge make it a bigger space . 
55430:18	###And if you if you compare those diagonal markings with the sorts of markings on on er some of these other stones , these these are a bit diagonal but if you look carefully they go there 're some going in that direction and some are going that direction . ###The tooling on on stones changes through time as as masons change their techniques , and er this is fifteenth century tooling , but that is twelfth century tooling . 
55548:31	###That 's you know any any architect 'll tell you that 's just wild , that 's just ridiculous , it 's very dangerous to put a doorway so close to the corner of a window . ###You have much more maintenance . 
55552:51	###Now if you can put all those three pieces of evidence together what does that suggest to you ? ###H er why would the people want to do that in a church ? 
55553:7	###H er why would the people want to do that in a church ? ###Plaster an outside of a wall with no so er with no drip course so this must have been an ? 
55669:7	###Mm ? ###So careful read the question . 
55751:104	###So that 's twenty six . ###Mm . 
55819:7	###Yeah there is is There 's an awful lot of suppose so about that you only gonna do one set of calculations rather than two are n't you ? ###Yeah . 
56053:7	###The simultaneous equations was n't it ? ###Why was it ? 
56235:13	###Of course it is . ###I did n't put a brackets there . 
56268:38	###Can you tell me how managed to produce nought point five , how you managed to produce that ? ###Do n't know . 
56268:49	###Can you tell me how managed to produce nought point five , how you managed to produce that ? ###Do n't know . 
56276:17	###Nine . ###Mm . 
56280:14	###Cos it 's not actually working algebraic that calculator at the present moment I do n't know what you 've got it programmed in What you 've got it at but it 's not working algebraic . ###Now it might work . 
56480:7	###Rather than quite as abstract as that But you can cope with abstract as that you can do A level . ###Yeah . 
56481:7	###Yeah . ###You have to cope 
56481:16	###Yeah . ###You have to cope 
56758:12	###Thank you . ###Mr , before I make a ruling on this point , did you wish to make er any further comment ? 
56775:61	###It is therefore a matter which lies within my discretion as to whether or not I take it as a late objection . ###I am not convinced that special circumstances apply in this case which override the which is advice given very clearly in the P P G Twelve , that , in general , late objections should not be entertained except in most exceptional circumstances . 
56779:158	###You are , however of course , aware that this background to insetting was discussed at some length yesterday , in the context of another village . ###There would , therefore in any event , be no need and no advantage for me , in repeating all that was said then . 
56897:56	###It reads , New development will normally be permitted outside the existing built-up areas only where it is essential to the needs of agriculture or forestry , or there are other exceptional circumstances . ###While as settlement within the greenbelt , development could not normally be permitted on D thirty nine and D forty , as these are outside the built area in the terms of Policy G B Three , which we have oft considered at erm this enquiry . 
56934:7	###It it does seem to me that the Parish Council are of course an an elected body , who will if they have views on this subject no doubt have formal minutes which will set it out one way or the other . ###I 'm wondering whether this might be an exceptional case , where er during cross- examination Mr might take instruction from his clients to find out what their minutes actually say . 
56961:21	###It 's simply the conclusion that the land does n't serve any greenbelt purpose . ###Yes that would be your reasoning , yes . 
56966:50	###I would not exclude a consideration of the greenbelt functions served by the area , but it is not for us to question the correctness of the approval by the Secretary of State for the Environment of the general extent of the greenbelt for York . ###A general extent of greenbelt within which this area lies . 
56971:119	###Well is er Mr the issue which the inspectors ought to be er addressing themselves whether or not this land serves a greenbelt purpose , or not ? ###I said a few moments ago that I would not exclude consideration or the need for consideration of the greenbelt purposes served . 
56996:51	###The issue is whether or not the land is open land or not open land ? ###It is essentially as simple as that . 
57008:66	###Er forgive me interrupting , ###but I I I do n't understand the word that you 're using Mr . 
57018:43	###I would say sir that my approach is neither . ###It is to look at the characteristics of the land itself , rather than to associate it of necessity with the land on one side of it or the land on the other side of it . 
57019:15	###It is to look at the characteristics of the land itself , rather than to associate it of necessity with the land on one side of it or the land on the other side of it . ###When we look at the characteristics of the land itself , do we have to decide whether it 's countryside or not countryside ? 
57113:7	###The characteristics of a conservation are are usually characteristics of special quality in environmental or building terms , and as such they are likely to promote a contribution to the quality of the setting of York where they occur within the greenbelt area . ###And that of course is the prime purpose of the York greenbelt . 
57216:14	###I regard open land of this size as being outside the existing built-up area of Skelton . ###That 's a matter for judgement is n't it ? 
57228:22	###Look I cannot conceive of development taking place on this land without coming into conflict with those policies . ###That is the essence of your position is it not ? 
57389:33	###In terms of their greenbelt function , the the the the boundary between them has no effect on the greenbelt purposes . ###It is the boundaries to the north alongside the A Nineteen . 
57621:18	###I do n't know if you I hope you remember that question , it was rather a long one . ###I hope you remember even more her answer to it , because the question is , Do you agree with it ? 
57621:28	###I do n't know if you I hope you remember that question , it was rather a long one . ###I hope you remember even more her answer to it , because the question is , Do you agree with it ? 
57776:44	###That 's possibly true . ###Erm proximity to areas of character is n't in itself a constraint to development . 
57791:10	###That 's a very sweeping statement . ###Yes it is . 
57982:9	###Yes . ###Fine , thank you . 
58008:71	###Erm and and that 's why I thought I 'd be more familiar with it . ###Well I did n't know I 'd got it . 
58013:12	###Er just tell us what it says please . ###Er I I I Otherwise 
58137:7	###And therefore we come back to the nature of the land in relation to the contribution it makes to the character of Skelton . ###And to the consideration which you have had in other cases regarding the character of villages and the acceptance that they preserve the special character of historic York . 
58190:38	###All I can say is this . ###We would urge you very strongly to er put a deadline er on receipt of er further objections by tomorrow sir but some of these proofs have been missing all of the discussion and they are literally months past their original fixture date . 
58190:64	###All I can say is this . ###We would urge you very strongly to er put a deadline er on receipt of er further objections by tomorrow sir but some of these proofs have been missing all of the discussion and they are literally months past their original fixture date . 
58199:10	###But I cannot , and I do n't think you 'd be right to expect my officers to prepare detailed rebuttals . ###Goodness knows what will be in these late proofs , they appear to be taking months to prepare . 
58226:29	###Er i it is something which can always happen . ###The other possibility er is that having read it the site visit that I will have made , in any event , either already or or at some time during the latter part of next week , I may discover there is something which one of the parties points out which I have n't looked at because I did n't realize that it was relevant . 
58329:22	###Okay Which diagram r represents a mixture of atoms ? ###Mm . 
58465:17	###each each year it sort of goes down to half . ###Okay . 
58479:5	###It 's the It ###Yeah . 
59137:31	###what about these other things that are in the air , does it clean clean them up as well ? ###Erm 
59248:74	###Okay ###I was thinking 
59976:56	###Now I hope you 're going to see a solicitor to make a will . ###I sha n't force you to but erm it 's an important document and the biggest problem about wills is that when anybody gets to look at it you 're not around to say what you meant . 
59992:89	###Say it 's a hundred and sixty thousand pounds . ###ten thousand pounds over the limit not on your death but on your spouses death remember . 
59999:35	###Hundred and fifty thousand pounds is the exempt limit so there 's no inheritance tax to pay on the death of the survivor . ###Tax to pay on your death , none because you yourself are worth a h less than a hundred and fifty thousand pounds and your will have ten thousand pounds , free of tax . 
60033:18	###pounds , and you 've willed it to go to your children after your spouse , ###Mhm . 
60034:50	###Mhm . ###I presume they would have to pay tax ? . 
60081:90	###Whether it 's a will whether it 's an intestacy the survivor takes because the survivor can deal with it , in the way that I 've described . ###And therefore it does n't matter what the will may have said erm I mean it does n't matter what the intestacy may be er that survivor takes it and it goes to the survivor outside of the will and you do not deal with it . 
60081:195	###Whether it 's a will whether it 's an intestacy the survivor takes because the survivor can deal with it , in the way that I 've described . ###And therefore it does n't matter what the will may have said erm I mean it does n't matter what the intestacy may be er that survivor takes it and it goes to the survivor outside of the will and you do not deal with it . 
60084:18	###So if you 're doing an inland revenue account for the tax man in other words inheritance tax and you 've got the bank account in joint names with thirty thousand in it . ###He 'll want to know about half that bank account , fifteen thousand pounds . 
60084:98	###So if you 're doing an inland revenue account for the tax man in other words inheritance tax and you 've got the bank account in joint names with thirty thousand in it . ###He 'll want to know about half that bank account , fifteen thousand pounds . 
60087:26	###It 's erm an area where two elements of the law do n't quite meet tidily and For instance if you worth four hundred thousand pounds big figure , and you had a hundred thousand of it in your own name and three hundred thousand jointly with your wife , wife die er you die , your estate for probate purposes is a hundred thousand pounds . ###That 's what you 've got to prove a will for , the three hundred thousand pounds has gone to your surviving spouse as a jointly owned property . 
60088:42	###That 's what you 've got to prove a will for , the three hundred thousand pounds has gone to your surviving spouse as a jointly owned property . ###Hundred thousand pounds you do not have to submit an inland revenue account , therefore you do n't need to tell them about the three hundred thousand pounds and therefore you wo n't pay inheritance tax . 
60101:7	###There are specific l l l levels . ###When you apply for a grant , be it by way of proving a will or of administration which is when there is an intestacy , part of the er documentation is an oath where you swear as to the size of the estate . 
60102:27	###When you apply for a grant , be it by way of proving a will or of administration which is when there is an intestacy , part of the er documentation is an oath where you swear as to the size of the estate . ###You have to swear usually that it 's under a hundred and twenty five thousand pounds . 
60103:41	###You have to swear usually that it 's under a hundred and twenty five thousand pounds . ###If that is the case you do n't have to complete and inland revenue account . 
60156:28	###But that 's the sort of thing you have in mind , have someone who 's a bit younger than yourself . ###Erm because it is an onerous task , erm onerous in terms of the time that needs spending doing the job even if it 's relatively simple in terms of what needs to be done it still takes time and there 's still running around to do . 
60159:11	###Brothers sisters , they 're the same age as you more or less , not necessarily a good idea . ###Nephews and nieces might be a better bet erm those are the sort of people have in mind . 
60210:99	###So that the bill I would es estimate , if you have a solicitor as executor would be the same as if you had a private person as ex as executor who went to see that solicitor . ###What those costs may be I 'm afraid I ca n't give you a good guide because depend on the amount of work . 
60224:10	###and to raise money say to pay erm this forty percent tax ###Mhm . 
60267:12	###Erm it 's one of life 's conundrums , there are of course answers which solicitors should know about . ###Number one is that if there are National Savings of any sort , they can be utilized to pay tax . 
60277:232	###You always need a residuary gift . ###Her surviving spouse , the one she 'd obviously done everything to make sure he did n't get a penny . 
60278:238	###Her surviving spouse , the one she 'd obviously done everything to make sure he did n't get a penny . ###Second thing was that having covered absolutely everything she was n't any estate , or at least did n't appear to be any so the surviving spouse was n't very interested in taking out a grant anyway cos it was n't going to get him any funds , so we then have the job of doing what 's called debarring him and basically he renounced his right to be of the administrator and we then had to go under the rules to find the next person which was one of the specific beneficiaries I E the sons . 
60279:28	###Second thing was that having covered absolutely everything she was n't any estate , or at least did n't appear to be any so the surviving spouse was n't very interested in taking out a grant anyway cos it was n't going to get him any funds , so we then have the job of doing what 's called debarring him and basically he renounced his right to be of the administrator and we then had to go under the rules to find the next person which was one of the specific beneficiaries I E the sons . ###In fact we turned up some gas shares on the way , but er and a bit of cash , but that was n't enough to pay the funeral accounts and she made no provision for paying any of the bills so I sold the gas shares towards paying the funeral account and then got shouted at by the er beneficiary children because I had n't consulted them about selling the gas shares and I said Well , they have to be sold because there 's bills to pay and there is no way of dealing with that . 
60313:18	###An ###You c You can er you can in fact have up to er you can find in you ex in your will as many people as you like but no more than four executors can prove at any one time . 
60314:64	###You c You can er you can in fact have up to er you can find in you ex in your will as many people as you like but no more than four executors can prove at any one time . ###Erm so what I have to is an executor appointed provided he lived in the country for instance because his address was abroad at the time . 
60348:12	###That or so er suffering form senile dementia or loss your memory , that you ca n't remember who you ought to have in mind . ###You can be schizophrenic and still make a will that . 
60360:7	###Written and signed by you and it 's witnessed by some independent witnesses . ###Now these are very important . 
60362:36	###They must be independent , not mention in the will you ca n't have a beneficiary who 's a witness , you ca n't have a husband or wife of a beneficiary as a witness either because not I 'm told very first clause there are n't , to get a duplicate made bungalow or something like that he might be missing out on the bungalow and the was The course leader at the time told me the story that saw him and he would n't tell me who it was I want my ten percent commission . ###put it down to just a useful . 
60379:41	###new marriage , new spouse intestacy rules , spouse is the nearest and gets the first lot so it presumes that having got married you want that spouse to have what you 've got . ###of course it may not be the case cos spouse may be well off , but you need to make a new will . 
60383:22	###They 've got six months from the grant to do that . ###But what you ca n't do is cross things out or add things one , they wo n't be effective . 
60531:43	###Rewarding in a financial sense I think you 'll find once you 've heard . ###Some of the subjects are a bit heavier than others . 
60532:9	###Some of the subjects are a bit heavier than others . ###This is the fault of of er behind the fact er we have to ask speakers when they can come to give their talk . 
60574:12	###him out by all means on any investment but this is the difference at the end of his talk he will be hoping that you will complete an application form for them to advise you individually . ###Which will be a form of contract between you and them . 
60617:22	###That 's alright . ###And then if it 's up to you to to take it or leave it . 
60768:81	###As far as the normal age retirement goes . ###Erm this is available to teachers and lecturers erm at the age of sixty . 
60802:20	###And that 's really because it 's it 's erm you know it 's for people under the age of of sixty . ###The redundancy erm if somebody leaves under redundancy situation then there is an additional payment of redundancy payment payable . 
60840:106	###And there are various methods of actually erm paying these contributions . ###by monthly instalments or by lump sums . 
60841:14	###by monthly instalments or by lump sums . ###Erm anybody who 's who 's interested erm if you 'd like to ask for a leaflet aft at the end of the session because the main thing is that you do have to take advantage of this while you are still employed in reckonable service . 
60878:106	###So ###But the money coming in from that A B C erm it was somebody from Grimsby who got into terrible trouble not not problems really with the T P A . 
60931:21	###Yes . ###Because if you pay 
60998:42	###Yeah got you . ###Thank you . 
61016:9	###Do do the other authorities pick up that automatically ? ###I do n't know what would happen . 
61056:13	###So if you like the that pension plus the the widow 's or widower 's would equate to your pension . ###Dependants ' pensions , it 's possible for er single people to actually nominate a financially dependant close relative to receive erm pension benefits in the event of your death . 
61060:12	###If anybody actually erm would wish to pursue this one , you actually need a leaflet eight six one pen . ###perhaps like to mention it at the end of the session and I can arrange to get one of those sent to you . 
61061:28	###perhaps like to mention it at the end of the session and I can arrange to get one of those sent to you . ###But you do have to make this nomination whilst you are employed in reckonable service . 
61065:39	###It 's it 's quite a quite a while . ###Quite a few years . 
61074:32	###So you can allocate up to a third . ###The thing is having done that erm if circumstances change you could n't actually you can no longer access that amount . 
61079:22	###The same provision applies I mean if you allocated s so much of your pension and that person died then there 's no way you can actually access that amount that you 've allocated . ###It 's once you 've allocated it it 's erm you know it 's actually gone from your from your calculation . 
61121:45	###Yeah . ###Can I make it quite crystal clear to my own mind , long term pension benefits it does n't come automatically it only comes if you surrender part of your own pension thus making provision for . 
61127:14	###But ###Which is quite separate to allocation . 
61194:54	###question about if you get employment outside education although , has no effect whatsoever on ###No . 
61277:77	###Erm basically as a new market opportunities come he 's gotta develop er and adapt to those any new opportunities that do arise . ###Be it new products , new competition and new markets that do arise . 
61399:63	###Yeah . ###And they 're having these X billions to finance er capital investment cos cos they 're not a private company . 
61432:57	###Yes yes it is yes that 's right it is . ###Yeah . 
61434:87	###Yes I mean we can understand that if you 're gonna get a cheaper ticket you 'll have to book well ahead and obviously they 've got to to try and ease the the overcrowding on some trains . ###There 's one other point 
61434:141	###Yes I mean we can understand that if you 're gonna get a cheaper ticket you 'll have to book well ahead and obviously they 've got to to try and ease the the overcrowding on some trains . ###There 's one other point 
61450:70	###Yeah . ###I I had er a return ticket from York to Gloucester and I was fortunate enough to get a lift back so I went into the station to ask if I could get a refund on the other half of the return and they said Sure you owe us four pounds . 
61555:60	###I 've also broken the smaller ones down into the cost for the still and the carbonated water . ###Erm the actual percentage of the ingredients used over the first year erm is about five percent for water , twenty three point six percent for the bottle , I 'll explain that later that 's quite high , the cap is four percent , one percent for the gassing , erm one percent for the case , two point seven percent for labour , four percent for transport , a general overhead would be about seventeen point one percent . 
61557:34	###Erm we 've made a provision for interest payable on the loan on the assumption that we may have to borrow money on an overdraft basis . ###And we 've made er that 's erm accounts for about one point six percent of the total cost . 
61565:64	###We 've just been in discussions with the manufacturers and we actually but we 're hoping to get a discount on that in the near future so we 're hoping the cost of that will come down . ###The contribution erm made by each of these products after we 've used an average sales price erm is seven and a half pence roughly for the smallest size , erm about eighteen pence average for the one litre size and eleven twelve percent twelve pence sorry for the large size . 
61576:18	###Erm the two litre size now like I say once again we 're having erm problems with getting erm an economical er cost for the bottle of this so our price is actually slightly higher than the other market price . ###Once again the market price erm for this size is from fifty three pence for own brand sizes up to about eighty pence for up sorry eighty two pence for erm the top quality products . 
61615:56	###That 's the people that we do n't call on erm with our representatives . ###We would we would like to build distribution in the in in this market with the use of specialized agency teams . 
61736:9	###Do you not see any problems with the clergy using the name ? ###Oh we we 've already spoken to the Archbishop 
61804:16	###How you attack those markets can be different in the sense that in er London the penetration of erm er mineral water into the target market is very high and therefore it 's already an accepted practice . ###Whereas in Yorkshire the penetration and usage is very low perhaps the lowest in the country erm where there is still very much a heritage of , Well what 's wrong with what 's in t ' tap lad ? 
61807:212	###And Scotland where there is a very strong national heritage and how are you going to push Yorkshire water into an area where there is a high heritage of water ? ###Can you do that with one advertising campaign or do you plan ? 
61913:77	###You know five add five do n't you . ###Yeah . 
61930:12	###We 'd write a one and a zero ###Yes . 
61930:52	###We 'd write a one and a zero ###Yes . 
61961:12	###Nine . ###you could work that one out . 
61961:41	###Nine . ###you could work that one out . 
61997:43	###That 's good . ###That 's very good numbers that add up to twelve okay . 
62207:10	###Most people say say you ca n't do it you ca n't do that can you go on . ###Hey with twelve people and only three pi 
62443:94	###If I say there you are there 's there 's two P take five P out of that . ###Ca n't do that . 
62445:7	###It 's when you you tend to say first thing you say is ca n't do that then you think , Oh well we get the we have to do it just playing silly game we get these funny numbers . ###It 's just a game so that we can so that they ca n't say there caught you out . 
62554:10	###Right so if someone holds up this piece and you hold up this piece to your mum and you say what sort of fraction is this ? ###She says I do n't know . 
62564:14	###Erm three . ###Three so good you should find that three pieces just like that the same size as that would all just fit together to make a whole . 
62568:14	###A third . ###Nearly you were going right all the way along there . 
62591:10	###Just go on . ###two out of the s 
62591:45	###Just go on . ###two out of the s 
62756:12	###So some odd bits you might think , I 'm not quite sure how you work that out . ###Not quite sure how you do that . 
62828:13	###So that one 'll be six six over ten . ###And that 's a decimal fraction okay . 
62901:53	###No possibly not does n't matter . ###I 'm not too sure . 
63112:36	###No . ###to do the lessons that Kerry is understanding it so she can . 
63253:7	###words two thirds of them . ###Yeah . 
63379:29	###I it ###That 's all you 'd get . 
63561:32	###And sometimes that means sending a drawing out getting a contractor to price for it rather than him doing it , er using standard books and goodness knows else like Sponds . ###He 'll come up with an estimated erm an estimated price and er and do most of the Q S-ing in house . 
63936:49	###What do we want to spend on top of that on printing an annual report ? ###And who are we gonna send it to , if anybody ? 
63946:7	###Mm . ###But they 
64014:33	###So . ###It seems to me that that there 's some manoeuvrability . 
64118:12	###Go on . ###if you 're wanting to produce two hundred of those I mean if we colour photocopy and you 're talking about forty five pence each 
64264:12	###Yes . ###Well . 
64267:17	###Yeah . ###we ? 
64434:93	###Let 's get back to this ###this other document .

65170:7	###Correct . ###And that 's regulations say 
65191:33	###There 's no way I 'm gonna turn round to them and say , Get stuffed . ###I want to retain that work . 
65222:76	###one of the reasons ###Yeah .

65889:9	###how do we measure i whether the two days have been successful ? ###And er she 's working on that . 
65954:7	###Cos it 's quite disappointing that we actually er agreed that we 'd start issuing client reports about two months , and as far as I 'm aware nobody started issuing them . ###Leeds North Wes

67598:30	###That 's sloppy . ###I think there 's only one post , and it 's in Jim 's office , where there are too many M S twos existing for the future M S two posts that , that , that we 've got on the document .

67656:8	###No . ###If at the end of the day once we have gone through the goo the good housekeena keeping exercise and he has been put into an M S three post that you think he is not capable of , then you 've got two options .

67799:24	###Splendid idea . ###Yeah . 
67799:41	###Splendid idea . ###Yeah .

67860:9	###Not on the agenda . ###Not on the

68114:17	###Yeah . ###But how do we get that across ? 
68407:40	###the costs , and if , if we had n't got the supervisors then you would have all made a proportion ###Mm 
68409:12	###less of that profit , because that twenty eight thousand pounds would have had to have been ###found by somebody else . 
68477:54	###It 's bad news , it 's bad news on a time basis . ###Yeah . 
68540:99	###the over the next years ###We just spent seven thousand quid on Alwyn that 's non-recoverable because of Quickspend .

68915:47	###I know . ###And I , and I said my premise was , if that 's the case , it 's too bloody high . 
68921:7	###Get rid of Nola ? ###But you know what , what would we want to do 
68995:10	###Yeah . ###to Roger and Terry . 
69101:38	###So it will be in your letter of delegation ###Yeah . 
69116:34	###That was certainly my understanding and certainly ###No . 
69160:65	###Yes . ###You see what our policy is M S two except b except by exception . 
69177:123	###then none of our M S threes ###would have come back at M S three . 
69223:13	###that the people who are delegated , are competent to discharge those duties . ###Yeah . 
69423:18	###What we 've got to do is say , look , within the terms of the contract ###This is what . 
69424:7	###This is what . ###this is what you have to do . 
69679:31	###The they still issue the certificate to the client , which is signed off price correct . ###Yes . 
69713:15	###you have a different quality system for different offices . ###But Hughie is 
69861:40	###that . ###Er a and I think we issue it and then t in Jim 's situation , erm I think what you tell your staff is that this , this has been issued , and we are gonna find a way of erm working it in your organization . 
70029:12	###Now if we work as a team and we work very sensibly and reasonably , it may wo may well be that the most sensible way of working is for the project engineer to decide who 's gonna do the site measure . ###But at the end of the day these guys sign off price correct . 
70141:20	###But we seem to have , right , I 'll , I 'll take that point back . ###Okay . 
70158:19	###I 'll tell Trudy 's ###So it 's not D is it D two point three or not ? 
70179:9	###wanting them from us . ###Yeah . 
70196:10	###The only problem is as a one-off exercise on ###er existing jobs . 
70277:12	###Yes . ###So , so really 
70295:18	###that occurred to me where we could ###perhaps give them some flexibility , is that we could say , if that 's not acceptable to you , we will delay invoicing . 
70333:23	###Yeah . ###you know ? 
70838:41	###T S S A circular ###Whereby 
70935:34	###yeah . ###but urgent by special arrangements . 
70994:79	###If he ca n't provide it , then we intend to obtain prints from er an external source and get the invoices sent to him . ###There 's no point in telling him that , because he 'll just refuse to pay them . 
71031:65	###Yeah . ###if he gets rid of his staff 
71073:63	###I 'll talk to . ###It it 's very 
71191:33	###what he wants to do . ###I 'm fully supportive of the P Way office getting the standard drawings there . 
71490:7	###The person who owns the asset . ###Well . 
71700:68	###Yes ? ###Andrew , Newcastle . 
71706:99	###We have n't looked the correlation to . ###Well I think this is partly one of the reasons that as urologists we need to be thinking about changing gear . 
71725:7	###That 's amazing . ###That 's , that 's not our experience here . 
71791:12	###We had forty five . ###Forty five . 
71922:93	###And thirdly , to compare adverse events erm er noted with the two strains of B G C . ###This paper refers to the objectives one and three and the incidence of recurrent disease will be the subject of a later report . 
71933:70	###All histological material , both from the first cystoscopy and the second cystoscopy , was sent both to the local pathologist and then representative sections sent to the reference pathologist . ###Both groups of patients , those receiving Pasteur and receiving the er erm Evans B G C , were comparable in terms of sex and age , the category and the grade of the tumour , the number of tumours , the size of the largest tumour , the duration of disease and the size of the marker tumour left in the bladder . 
71958:9	###Er o er ascribed a description of mild , moderate or severe and the degree of inflammatory response was virtually identical in the two groups . ###In the slide in which I showed the overall results it appears that about half the patients , the erm marker tumour had been eradicated and in quite a lot of patients there were tumours present . 
72072:12	###Now you may think to yourself , goodness , what an awful lot of complaints . ###And of course it is . 
72086:42	###Which means of course if you work for Trading Standards , as I did until very recently if you work for Trading Standards you tend to get a rather jaundiced view of shopping . ###All we ever hear about are disasters and complaints and things that have gone wrong . 
72094:15	###And it is a refreshing change to t to talk to someone who 's bought something from shop and they have no complaints whatever . ###Now as I say in round figures it 's about twenty thousand just in this one county alone . 
72131:52	###I 've no doubt Bernard does . ###We all do . 
72357:10	###The quicker you do that the better chances will be of getting your money back . ###But the longer you leave it the worse your chances are going to get . 
72374:26	###No money refunded on sale goods . ###All those signs are illegal . 
72427:32	###Four days later it packed up . ###Dixons refused to exchange it because we did n't return it in the original packaging . 
72451:124	###And I know it 's very easy for me to stand here and say you know try to keep calm and polite and reasonable . ###And that brings us back to your point , that there are times when you , you , you know you have , in order to get your statutory rights you 've got to be pretty firm . 
72456:113	###But that brings us back to the point we were stressing a moment ago , if the goods are faulty you 're entitled to money back , a cash refund . ###Er you need only accept a credit note if the problem is your own fault in some way . 
72465:29	###a matter of customer ? ###With Marks and Spencers it is a matter of customer relations . 
72470:103	###After all a reputable retailer does n't want a lot of dissatisfied customers walking about . ###He 'll want you , quite naturally , to keep on trading with him . 
72501:59	###I would say golden rule number one is keep receipts . ###Very important . 
72513:7	###VAT receipt . ###Yes . 
72520:7	###No . ###Erm 
72725:32	###And school holidays and you 've got your grandchildren or grandchild come to stay with you and granddad has his favourite chair by the side of the fire . ###He has his box of matches or his lighter and he likes his pipe . 
72935:63	###Again if you go over the thirteen amp you 're trying to draw out more elec electricity and you 're causing overheating . ###Okay ? 
72935:93	###Again if you go over the thirteen amp you 're trying to draw out more elec electricity and you 're causing overheating . ###Okay ? 
72943:7	###It will go and it should go but again if you 've not got ###the correct fuse in it wo n't go . 
72947:51	###But for safety 's sake ladies ###and gentlemen please do not exceed the thirteen amps output on your piece of apparatus . 
72978:34	###Plugs left switched on . ###Okay ? 
72981:9	###The fridge-freezer otherwise you 'd get up every morning and you 'd have a right mess in your cupboard would n't you ? ###In , in your er kitchen . 
73122:27	###And the flame propagation is so rapid it 's consumed that it just blows . ###Okay ? 
73206:17	###But they are both apt in th they 'll do and they 'll both do the job . ###So do n't start getting yourself worried well , have I got an ionization or have I got an op an optical one . 
73237:7	###Erm it is because they are so acute , the least little whiff and they 're away . ###Okay ? 
73362:87	###whichever takes your fancy , you 're gonna have a right mess in your kitchen are n't you ? ###Yeah . 
73416:43	###I 'd like to talk about Scottish Homes open space maintenance charters i.e. , grass cutting etcetera . ###Right . 
73432:105	###So , there are a hundred ninety two houses in this particular estate erm , which makes a total of eight hundred and forty pound just for sending a bill ! ###Right . 
73444:18	###Right . ###So I mean , this is a ridiculous state of affairs ! 
73481:9	###Right . ###Er if my choice , I 'd like to be in the docks , but things cannot ha happen that way , we 've got a lot o , a lot of the yuppies moving in that area , and that seems to be taking over that area so no chance of a football stadium there . 
73525:41	###All he has been trying to do is to trying to ensure that there 's been even-handed play here on all the stadium sites and it 's disgraceful that his name has been dragged into this ! ###Hearts will either be at Hermestone or Tynecastle . 
73526:45	###Hearts will either be at Hermestone or Tynecastle . ###Ingleston , if we were offered a King 's ransom , we might have to sit down and think about it , but it is very much a long , long shot ! 
73539:12	###So , so if the , if the region come back to you and knock back Hermestone , er would you appeal ? ###Or would you just say , well that 's it let 's press again with Tynecastle ? 
73541:55	###Well we 'll have to consider that along with land Messrs , cos we think it 's a brilliant site with good road access and we want to work very hard with the people that put the deal together . ###But , Tynecastle is very much a , a second option , that we 're really quite keen on now . 
73557:96	###And if we do n't go to Hermestone , we 'll stay at Tynecastle . ###That 's the bottom line ! 
73572:87	###Yes . ###Erm there 's an article in one of the papers this morning , and er it was I think it 's an absolute disgrace ! 
73596:150	###I mean , th th there 's , I mean I think it 's an absolute disgrace as I said , really ! ###I mean , I think it 's terrible and , and I mean , if Mr Lilley himself went into some of the houses that I go into and see the the existence that they live , because that 's all it is , you know , it 's just an existence . 
73643:14	###Well nothing we can do ! ###But the point is David , they are broken , now ! 
73643:130	###Well nothing we can do ! ###But the point is David , they are broken , now ! 
73720:7	###If other people have had other experiences , if if they share erm , er Nelly 's er belief there that there is nothing that can be done about it ? ' s the number to dial and we 'll have some more calls in a moment . ###You 're listening to Dial David Johnston on Max A M . 
73733:17	###And , they keep saying that surely that would suit everybody ? ###I do n't even know Hearts fans that would like to go out there . 
73762:69	###But , I mean , do , to to be more realistic , I mean , o , if , obviously if , if all the government took a fifty percent pay cut it still would n't make a great deal of difference ? ###If benefits are going to be squeezed , i is there a , is there a painless way of doing it or , or is it going to cause suffering whatever happens ? 
73762:99	###But , I mean , do , to to be more realistic , I mean , o , if , obviously if , if all the government took a fifty percent pay cut it still would n't make a great deal of difference ? ###If benefits are going to be squeezed , i is there a , is there a painless way of doing it or , or is it going to cause suffering whatever happens ? 
73770:79	###Definitely , they 're making far better living , but they 're also getting all their benefits , they 're getting er fringe benefits off the government . ###Mm . 
73784:165	###It 's about this Scottish Homes Charters . ###Mhm . 
73793:105	###And I feel that many solicitors do not do their job they do not explain fully to the purchaser what they are taking on . ###Right . 
73800:117	###Therefore , I know it 's in my title deeds and I would assume it 's in his title deeds . ###Right . 
73917:160	###Mhm . ###Er , why ca n't they just look at , er do a means test for child benefit ? 
73925:76	###Er , in double income families , certainly in double income families , surely the wife 's gonna have more control over the money that she earns and the money that she can use ? ###Okay . 
73926:11	###Okay . ###But I mean , er you can see the , you can see the point of that and and presumably , yes , there must be lots of very wealthy people who who er , just get the child benefit and hardly notice it but at the same time , could n't we means test the old age pension ? 
73931:133	###Erm but there comes a point where th , the government , the line that the government draws for means testing 's always very low . ###Whe , why to take the , the sting out of the issue they could put the , the line higher up on the earning scale , or higher up on the sa the receiving scale for the older ones who have so , possibly stopped working ? 
73952:79	###This also states that under the government rules and the Lothian regional council can only publish the list in public libraries . ###And the , this will appear by the end of November , and people will only have after this first council tax demands in March , they 've got to appeal if they think they 're in the wrong band . 
73955:54	###I find it , find it hard to believe that you 're not gonna be told th the valuation of your house , in as ###Well , it 
73961:18	###and it says , you can only appeal it will appear in November , that 's when it 's going to be , er put into the library ###Mhm . 
73976:53	###Erm I would go further than erm performance related pay for the cabinet and , and so on , and I would actually put them all on income support erm and see how they could cope ! ###Or er , or on the dole er level of er of money . 
73985:188	###That could be the first cut in my opinion . ###They 're on seventy and eighty thousand er er a year ! 
73986:12	###They 're on seventy and eighty thousand er er a year ! ###Er , the economic situation is is entirely their fault , er , not that I 'm saying that the Labour would do any better , but erm I 'd like to see a bit more er , a bit more opposition from the er , from the Labour party and er , not so much direct action , but saying , you know , things do not have to be like this ! 
73988:59	###There do not have to be any homeless people ! ###Er , and it 's er outrageous er that there are ! 
74018:26	###Right . ###over the last ten years ! 
74068:63	###Bu but I mean , what alternative is there if there 's not enough money meet the benefit bill ? ###Well , I mean , who says that there is n't enough enough money to meet the benefit bill ? 
74082:28	###Yeah . ###Between ea , between east and west . 
74112:71	###A and , we it , well that that takes us back to to er , to what I think , either er Tom or Jim was saying there that you know , if you 're paying into something yo you you expect to er , to get out of it when and if you need it . ###Well you do . 
74182:10	###Helen ? ###I do n't know . 
74190:49	###I mean , December , sorry ! ###December . 
74191:18	###December . ###Now , that would have been a W I committee day so we 've had to alter the committee to the Tuesday , so I 'm afraid they 'll be no handy craft on Tuesday the first of December . 
74232:13	###Th , Tuesday the third of November . ###And if you 've got any money left er the calendars and diaries Brenda has taken the names today and the money at the same time when you order . 
74248:10	###Erm which I could n't have managed without them . ###So erm the voting papers are out today so please erm go round and get peoples ' names . 
74248:80	###Erm which I could n't have managed without them . ###So erm the voting papers are out today so please erm go round and get peoples ' names . 
74261:7	###Oh ! ###There 's erm 
74273:7	###Okay . ###Vera , would you like to say som , oh ! 
74284:60	###Now , Vera you want to say a word do n't you ? ###Thank you . 
74313:108	###And I 've got some itineraries which you can take away , if you want . ###If you 'd like to come and get one in tea time . 
74337:9	###I 'm only trying to sell the time then ! ###Ha ! 
74395:13	###Now , er , there is no what can I say ? ###There is no skin care is a very basic thing . 
74400:13	###I hope so . ###So what is skin care ? 
74417:10	###Gone are the days when you 've got these thick creams that you could n't get off unless you used an alcohol toner to remove them . ###So , a cleansing milk a little a amount in the palm of your hand put over the face , then rinsed off with warm water and then you can dry your face with a towel and you would feel then , perhaps , that you 'd really washed your face . 
74417:21	###Gone are the days when you 've got these thick creams that you could n't get off unless you used an alcohol toner to remove them . ###So , a cleansing milk a little a amount in the palm of your hand put over the face , then rinsed off with warm water and then you can dry your face with a towel and you would feel then , perhaps , that you 'd really washed your face . 
74427:12	###I feel that the moisturizer will keep your skin nice and soft . ###You wo n't get any flakiness , you wo n't get any dryness on the skin if you use a moisturizer . 
74430:43	###Now with the dermatological products , I actually have n't bought those with me apart from those that we 're going to use as a demo erm , the have a very nice cleanser called special cleansing gel , and if you 're used to using soap and water it really is very similar to using soap . ###You put a little of the gel in the palm of the hand , use water to lather it , put the lather over your face , and then again , rinse off with warm water and you feel as if you 've used soap and water . 
74623:66	###for being our volunteer ? ###They were just very quick demonstrations , but it does take longer if you come to a salon . 
74669:154	###And the other part of facial waxing is , on the chin , we tend to get quite a few growing on our chin , and upper lip . ###There are two things we can do with hair on the upper lip , we can either bleach it so that it does n't notice , or we can actually remove it with wax , or we can have electrolysis . 
74689:15	###We do manicures , and we do pedicures . ###Manicures are , i , are ideal for trimming your nails , pushing down the cuticles , and making your nails look into a nice shape and nice and clean . 
74722:37	###Oh ! ###So that 's something else to think about . 
74723:17	###So that 's something else to think about . ###I 'm telling you all this , and perhaps you do n't have to erm pay for any of these treatments we do gift vouchers , so if you 've got anybody who wants to buy you a gift of any sort , you could always say well , I fancy erm an eyebrow trim , or I fancy a pedicure perhaps they would like to buy you a gift voucher and then you can come in and it could be a present for you . 
74728:13	###A gift voucher can be of any value . ###Alright ? 
74748:11	###So it does depend on what skin type , and we actually choose the erm aromatherapy oils according the skin type . ###Yeah . 
75423:7	###I 've got them there I cannae see it . ###Which one 's that ? 
75974:7	###Aha . ###to get platelet , to get platelets , two reactions .

76013:66	###Where they used to rest the the coffin for a m m and have a dram and a piece of cheese or some biscuits . ###They had to go back ag go back again for the coffin . 
76025:10	###But it was a lovely moonlit night and we did n't leave , it was about eight o' clock at night when we left . ###We were at at there , and I went with er with my father er on a Friday and we came back that night . 
76049:7	###But how did the , what was puzzling a lot of people how did he manage to get it off the ground and into his pocket . ###By his teeth ?

77781:8	###I 'll gladly suggest it . ###But er 
77904:28	###Here detectives in Mansfield are hunting a man who attacked a fifteen year old girl near a hospital . ###It happened yesterday afternoon as the teenager was walking along a footpath through Hospital in the town . 
77916:9	###About a week or so ago , when I was away from the morning show for a week doing a bit of gardening , decorating , and all those things that we all love to take time off . ###I mean we we spend all our life at work , then go home and we do more work . 
77918:9	###But I had to go in the loft . ###But I hate doing I hate creepy crawlies , I hate spiders and I hate going in the loft . 
78018:18	###So er I hope what this er series of interviews will er serve to prove , is both the quality of thinking that 's going on about public services , and our very strong commitment to the customers and citizens we serve . ###the road system , that 'll be wonderful . 
78065:57	###Start of the Newark festival gig night tonight . ###Four local bands play in the castle grounds . 
78266:22	###Police are particularly anxious to trace a courting couple who were seen nearby at the time of the attack . ###The say it 's vital the rapist is caught before he strikes again . 
78277:30	###Nottingham Crown Court has been hearing allegations that a taxi driver raped a lesbian passenger after picking her up from a nightclub . ###Mark has this . 
78298:58	###Very very angry cos to tell try and tell the truth and not believes is it 's is wrong . ###Bill who campaigns for the human rights group in Nottingham says there 's too much margin for error in the justice system . 
78299:48	###Bill who campaigns for the human rights group in Nottingham says there 's too much margin for error in the justice system . ###The police ca n't even decide to charge someone , t is the Crown Prosecution Service who must decide whether or not they 're going to charge someone . 
78317:77	###They 'll always be in the record books that I am the only man at any weight who 's ever won three Lonsdale belts outright . ###That 's there for ever . 
78440:25	###His widow Diane says there 's been a terrible injustice . ###I saw my husband die in front of my eyes . 
78441:7	###I saw my husband die in front of my eyes . ###I was attacked too , and I had to get up next morning and tell my daughter , she did n't have a daddy any more . 
78442:10	###I was attacked too , and I had to get up next morning and tell my daughter , she did n't have a daddy any more . ###I had to go Christmas . 
78486:15	###I hate that at nightclubs . ###I 'm just the same . 
78573:32	###She oh shears yeah . ###Yeah . 
78623:9	###They 're trying to er knock or they were trying to knock News at Ten on the head . ###One of the best suggestions I heard was to er change it to Channel Four . 
79042:171	###How big were the classes then ? ###Can you recall that ? 
79043:82	###Can you recall that ? ###I recall being in the first class and er a teacher coming to me , as I were n't paying much attention I think , and to this day I shall remember and never forget , she just folded my arms in front of me and says , Percy , you 're not listening , you 'll have to have a rest . 
79058:28	###Anyway , standard one was a breaking-in for this er other discipline and not quite so easy and learning how to spell . ###And teacher would er tell us that next week with her spelling lesson she 'd want a new word , would we learn one at home ? 
79062:62	###Again , Oh we 'd graduated then from pencils and paper , to pen and ink and paper , the ink being in er a well sunk in the desk in front of us . ###Each boy had a inkwell and er a pen , blue-black ink and so on and some of the small books that we used for writing in were kept under the desk . 
79065:107	###Er standard one was er no trouble , except er er pretty timid , remember being timid , the boys could be very rough in play and there was much nudging in the playground as they ran about at their various games . ###And so to standard two , where the That was th the next year , each class was expected to take about a year , which it did . 
79079:88	###Because although that war did n't have conscription in nineteen fourteen or nineteen fifteen , I believe it started in nineteen sixteen , back end , and er we we 'd got all women teachers who were quite a different problem from a school of that nature . ###Cos a boy in standard five could be getting on for thirteen . 
79102:40	###It 's a cruel thing and especially to hit a boy on his right hand and then expect him to write with it . ###This I found , at various times , my fingers were suffering from this wallop in the oh , at ten past nine in the morning . 
79103:9	###This I found , at various times , my fingers were suffering from this wallop in the oh , at ten past nine in the morning . ###But anyway , most things were like that , I think it had to be something like , In his noisy mansion , skilled to rule . 
79103:25	###This I found , at various times , my fingers were suffering from this wallop in the oh , at ten past nine in the morning . ###But anyway , most things were like that , I think it had to be something like , In his noisy mansion , skilled to rule . 
79148:33	###Twenties . ###Yeah . 
79148:51	###Twenties . ###Yeah . 
79151:115	###You could have earlies , lates and nights , which many people do n't know , and I worked earlies , lates and night in engineering . ###Earlies er when I worked at the Ford Motor Company it meant getting from Ilford to Dagenham and starting on a machine at six A M in the morning , in the middle of winter or the middle of summer . 
79194:33	###Can you remember the name of it ? place ? ###It was the John and a very big factory in it 's day , in as much as it was er four storeys high , rather high in those days for heavy machinery to be on level like that . 
79215:7	###I went to Newark and got a job at , a ball bearing factory , and er they paid me the handsome wage of er two pounds sixteen for forty seven hours . ###It came to about one and three halfpence an hour . 
79219:38	###Yeah . ###You would n't ten shillings for a day . 
79234:42	###and commanded a little bit more . ###Yeah . 
79234:70	###and commanded a little bit more . ###Yeah . 
79240:39	###There were other places in Nottingham that had made nothing but hosiery machines and were n't quite as good as were at making lace machines . ###had a good reputation , although it was a non-union firm and n much maligned by er union people who disliked stand for not er sort of recognizing . 
79261:46	###When I er er were in the tool room at , Newark at the age of twenty one plus , you see , not twenty two er I was approached then by a shop steward who worked on the bench , was a fitter . ###I was always on a machine , cutting , milling machine . 
79270:7	###They will talk about salaries and things like that but they 're often paid , well , very remotely some of them , monthly now , and think that 's er heavenly or something . ###But mostly , in my experience , they were paid just the same as we do we were , perhaps on a different day and a different method . 
79276:47	###Mm . ###and it would appear in the simple times , before mine , even I had experience at Newark , that men could get a sub in the week because you 're actually in two days you 've actually earnt two days money and you have n't got it . 
79276:83	###Mm . ###and it would appear in the simple times , before mine , even I had experience at Newark , that men could get a sub in the week because you 're actually in two days you 've actually earnt two days money and you have n't got it . 
79277:9	###and it would appear in the simple times , before mine , even I had experience at Newark , that men could get a sub in the week because you 're actually in two days you 've actually earnt two days money and you have n't got it . ###And if a yarn was spun , or a general true story that a man had to have his train fare to get to Newark and he had to pay this and that , you could er get a loan on your wages . 
79296:37	###And but at Fords we they we were laid off again for this other weekend till they took stock . ###It would appear Henry Ford had insisted on this ever since that crush , so that he could always how he stood financially . 
79367:69	###And then we stayed a few days in London and we went to the Baths and we went to the zoo and we went to all the science , by either the old trams or the first of the buses that Cos they complete with tram-riding and that was rather exciting in London , seeing the all the top hats and people in coats , tails and things . ###Very nice . 
79370:7	###Except for , perhaps , a half day excursion to Skegness which costs one and threepence and if you 'd missed the train they had another one ready for you , not like British Rail today , enterprising . ###Er how much did it cost to go to London then ? 
79416:32	###H . ###Smith on the station , well , that involved a paper round starting round about six o' clock in the morning . 
79441:8	###So by the end of the day you 's probably earned three shillings on the local market . ###Tt . 
79465:25	###How old were you when you left school , by the way ? ###Well I was er Er the school days from were from er eleven to fourteen and er tt of course during that time we had the opportunity to try and pass for grammar . 
79469:41	###And at ###No loss . 
79472:26	###Perhaps I would n't too , I do n't really know . ###Er so so when you left school how did you go about looking for a job ? 
79477:7	###Tt twelve and six a week plus commission . ###And what did 
79479:28	###you have to do for that then ? ###Pardon ? 
79497:15	###than likely , sixpences , but they mounted up . ###Anyway , 
79517:71	###Fun and games till the afternoon when we started to blow the furnaces and that was the happy time . ###Tap , tap , tap , sparks flying everywhere and we were just above it with the cranes , waiting to fill the big ladles . 
79519:11	###So we 'd fill them and we could n't see anyway , lookin We could n't look down and see , we had to wait for the foreman shouting all the instructions , move left , forward or up or down . ###Cos the molten metal blinded you anyway , no glasses or anything then . 
79535:34	###No , we had no accidents , the only one I had was er when I 'd been right to the top , with the other crane an and it was a long shop , and everyone had done with me during the morning , so I hoisted the crane up , pulled it in towards me and set myself going down the shop , put it in full speed . ###I knew exactly where to stop it so that I could get off and go down the ladder , sneak a cup of tea or something . 
79541:7	###Did n't get the sack though . ###No , it got repaired . 
79541:73	###Did n't get the sack though . ###No , it got repaired . 
79552:45	###It was that good you dare n't do anything it , so hide it . ###I used to hide these three pennies because er not being used to having anything for nothing , when I 'd got two or three coppers , I 'd d I 'd find a little hiding place outside and this house had an outside wash house in the back and I used to hide them . 
79552:106	###It was that good you dare n't do anything it , so hide it . ###I used to hide these three pennies because er not being used to having anything for nothing , when I 'd got two or three coppers , I 'd d I 'd find a little hiding place outside and this house had an outside wash house in the back and I used to hide them . 
79566:36	###Start next week . ###There were no bass there then , no bass . 
79600:66	###Well , ten minutes later it was still up to me knees , I said , I ca n't keep this up and he shouted something down to somebody else , who shouted to somebody else , Put your sprags back lads . ###And apparently these other lads further down , to the tune of about a hundred and fifty yards , had all lifted the boards up on the belt and so all their slack and that was coming to me . 
79640:41	###Course one of the problems was you were checked in and checked out and if er you had n't come out there was a bit of a panic , Where is the person ? ###Where is his er number like ? 
79680:78	###And then er the the the lace trade he he worked on , when women wore high collars , boned high collars and he made the little narrow edging lace about like that and it was goffered so it made a frill round the face . ###And he er he 'd made all that lace , well then instead of him going in the First World War and making the net which was used you see his lace trade all went . 
79769:95	###We and we had some marvellous Christmas parties because we used to play all sorts of games . ###And I remember one game in particular it always stuck in me mind . 
79771:7	###Somebody used to sit on the carpet at one end of the room with a walking stick and a chalk mark in front of him and the contestants used to have to come up to him and try to rub the marking out and he used to rap the hands with his walking stick . ###I can remember that game ever so well . 
79841:63	###And what , did you have nay thoughts of what you would do when you left school ? ###No did n't go any where at all just stayed at home . 
79842:45	###No did n't go any where at all just stayed at home . ###And then after about two years when Father le realized that the lace trade was going he said , must to put to a trade . 
79855:27	###And they al always used to order half a dozen hats . ###And as an apprentice you , I was a year there for nothing , a ye , half a year for half a crown , half a year for five shillings , and at the end of five years I was earning fourteen shillings . 
79858:7	###And I used to trail round all these shops . ###What exactly did you do when you went round the shops ? 
79859:56	###What exactly did you do when you went round the shops ? ###You had to collect ? 
79874:73	###Yes . ###And did you have any breaks for for lunch or anything ? 
79877:28	###I remember boiling the milk and pouring it on the tea leaves . ###They always had it . 
79942:81	###I wonder I was wondering whether some people were having abortion because they perhaps already had too many children ? ###Well I I di I did n't kno I never met anybody i in in that category . 
80046:77	###You see they were back to back . ###Yes . 
80085:9	###But you see you 've got to know what you 're doing , you 've got to really look after yourself . ###I mean I , it 's no good me husbands to look af , I I this is my second husband but er with my first husband er I I sort of erm if it 's been left to him , God bless him , he 's dead now but if it 'd been left to him I 'd have had a houseful of children you know . 
80140:47	###Yes . ###things like that ? 
80142:62	###Yes , when I got home at night I I was er I had to I was sent to the hospital I was bleeding . ###And erm you know it was pretty bad . 
80165:84	###That 's right . ###Can you tell me how this all came about ? 
80168:52	###And er what I did I got everything , you know the , I do n't think it was , and some warm water and I saw that my hands was well clean and I 'd got some very nice little silver spoons , only small ones . ###And er I er penetrated , it took two or three days in the womb with this spoon , and the heard something go pop . 
80215:200	###What money did you have coming in at that time in fact ? ###Oh I do n't think we di we 'd hardly anything . 
80216:88	###Oh I do n't think we di we 'd hardly anything . ###They would n't , the miners hardly got anything and there used to be soup kitchens for us and er when it first started in nineteen twenty six and er I was pregnant with my second one and I used to walk right down to Pit with a lace , great big lace basket , they would n't let the men fetch the coal and we had to push the coal from there right to the , oh they 've no idea love , no idea . 
80217:13	###They would n't , the miners hardly got anything and there used to be soup kitchens for us and er when it first started in nineteen twenty six and er I was pregnant with my second one and I used to walk right down to Pit with a lace , great big lace basket , they would n't let the men fetch the coal and we had to push the coal from there right to the , oh they 've no idea love , no idea . ###You see there 'd been the nineteen fourteen eighteen War , then there 'd there was the strike , and er I started to work and I had to go to work . 
80249:141	###There was the what they tern the French letter . ###But they could n't afford them . 
80305:19	###Mm . ###Er only th back counter effort was er Slippery Elm , that was a back of the counter sort of thing , Slippery Elm , because it was dangerous practice . 
80368:25	###Erm it was a load of Epsom Salts and er and a lot of gin and hot baths , that brought it on sometimes . ###And then again I tell you you could use the enema , and that er but er mostly it would you know you would get right again , but it took some doing , not easy . 
80374:55	###Never . ###I could never allow anybody to do anything for me , ca n't now . 
80400:11	###What sort of person would she have been , I 'm I 'm wondering whether she would be doing this for money or was she be doing it because she really cared about people . ###Oh yes , money . 
80415:20	###Oh dear , it makes you laugh do n't it . ###The family was against it but still he stuck to her . 
80470:48	###What about doctors in those days , did they give anybody advice about erm ###Just tell you not to do it . 
80532:81	###That 's just by where your friend lives . ###lived in that house there and it was three shillings a week , I think it was , two up and two down . 
80533:16	###lived in that house there and it was three shillings a week , I think it was , two up and two down . ###One biggish living room and a little back kitchen with no water and no sanitation and if you wanted to dispose of your water you 'd have to take it out on the roadside and chuck it down the main drain .

80541:49	###Mum and Dad and six kids , there was four in one bedroom , me sister , me and her my Me two sisters in the slept in in a double bed in me Mam 's bedroom and we four lads slept in the back bedroom w w whi which was just just big enough to get a double bed in , as you can see , and there was two that slept at the top , and two slept at the bottom . ###And you can guess what that was like with four four of us in bed , Hey Wi move your feet . 
80555:138	###Aye . ###And er great big pulleys with three inch leather belts , if they 'd have done it in , er do it in these days and the factory inspector would have cut him to pieces . 
80579:12	###But if you do n't know how , it 'll kill you . ###Same as all farm work , see , farm work They do n't know as they 're born these days , these youngsters do n't , when they come to talking about farming . 
80580:49	###Same as all farm work , see , farm work They do n't know as they 're born these days , these youngsters do n't , when they come to talking about farming . ###used to have to w run the old b back the old horse and cart into the co crew yard which had been standing all year with about umpteen beasts on it , trampling it down , more straw , trample it down , more straw , trample it down . 
80582:33	###Then in back end they used to empty this crew yard and you used to have to handle all that with forks , muck forks , they used to call them , and that was big biggest fork and by God , they used to pull your heart out . ###You can guess what it was like , straw and everything , being trampled down all winter , sodden with with water and everything . 
80592:101	###One in the furrow and one on the stubble , see ? ###And you used to do that at a ten inch blade all day , up and down that field . 
80611:50	###You used to go in the fields and turn it and when it had been turned they used to start leading . ###And i if the man in the field had got a grudge against a bloke who was stacking i or taking off in the stack yard he could make life hell . 
80614:102	###See ? ###And when you 'd got your centre filled in , you used to start again , , one in the corner , one the other corner , one between the eyes , one in the middle and back again . 
80615:15	###And when you 'd got your centre filled in , you used to start again , , one in the corner , one the other corner , one between the eyes , one in the middle and back again . ###Now if you 'd got grudge against the bloke who was taking it off in the shop , in the farmyard , after when you got back home , of course you had to come I mean they did n't stick it in the field , like they do now . 
80616:86	###Now if you 'd got grudge against the bloke who was taking it off in the shop , in the farmyard , after when you got back home , of course you had to come I mean they did n't stick it in the field , like they do now . ###You used to have to bring the stuff to the farmyard to store it , you see ? 
80619:64	###By God it was hard , it was hard work in those days . ###And see the same with mangle tagging , dunnet tagging , sugar beet pulling . 
80632:22	###You used to have a special chopper for your mangles and it was like a big mincing machine , with a great big wheel on , and you used to fill it full of er mangles , or turnips and it used to come out like chips . ###And then you used to mix it up with bran and oats and cake and that sort of stuff , for the horses . 
80638:13	###And my God , again it was hard work , we used to put it in this hay chopper , pile it in and chop and it used to come out like chaff . ###And that was for your horses , you see ? 
80639:19	###And that was for your horses , you see ? ###An and they had to be fed . 
80644:30	###They 'd do anything , my duck . ###Did you used to go and help on the farm as well ? 
80665:10	###On Lane , walking it . ###Come rain , come shine . 
80667:26	###And you had to put it in the letter box , you dare n't leave it in the in the . ###Milk round , with the old ladle and jug . 
80679:10	###And it was milk , after they 'd milked the cow first time , after she 'd had a calf , well the first milking , they usually got blood in the milk , you see ? ###But the second milking , and so forth on , perhaps the thir second or third milking they used to get milk , what they called beastlings and it was very often too much for the calves to take , so she got a full bag . 
80689:59	###Did your Mum do any sort of work at all ? ###Mum , she 'd got to do , darling . 
80693:30	###these skivvies , in , what we called skivvies in those days , at these big houses up round a about the village . ###Y you got about twelve and sixpence a w a year .

81884:11	###Wha what sort of er things did you have to do then ? ###Well I used to cycle from Gedling to Apsley , me debit was at Apsley and I used to have to cycle from there to Apsley and I used to take bit of food an and bread and cheese and pieces of anything I could pick up in me pocket , and I dare n't come home till I 'd got some business . 
81900:15	###And were you involved in a trade union at all ? ###Oh yes , oh yes .

81971:20	###You was expected to er to get to know these and also you was to taught to er sharpen the wood tools . ###Such as saws , chisels , and so forth . 
81974:47	###Now , after that , you was er taught all the parts of the waggons , and er this took quite a long while because we did n't know anything about them , and er where they all went and the parts they went . ###And then , after that , you was taught , er about six month , you was taught then er to measure the timbers up and also er start to er er mark the the er timbers out . 
81975:66	###And then , after that , you was taught , er about six month , you was taught then er to measure the timbers up and also er start to er er mark the the er timbers out . ###Because everything was handmade , er all the holes in the er timbers , they had to be carefully er marked out so that y er when they went to the wood machines there was a er they would be bored in the right place , and the right size of holes . 
81976:11	###Because everything was handmade , er all the holes in the er timbers , they had to be carefully er marked out so that y er when they went to the wood machines there was a er they would be bored in the right place , and the right size of holes . ###Which was ranged from half inch , to two inches , and then of course the mortices , and tenons , they had to be marked out . 
82027:7	###So everything was done by hand , in fact ? ###Everything was done by hand . 
82032:18	###No , at the end . ###When you 'd got a little bit more money . 
82034:18	###. Of course , we had to have good quality tools , we had er er now , we had Spear and Jackson saws , always , because they was the best quality . ###And , Ridgeways , we had a special bits , what we called a fast bit , for er for the er o the bodywork an and instead of having the the pointed er er er cutters on , it was the flat cutters , you see , they was a bit faster . 
82037:26	###Which the normal one was er er , w I think it 's a five inch brace for the er er it 's five inch sweeper , in other words it 's er about Is it six inches ? ###Twelve inch sweep for the er with the brace , they had normally .

82050:46	###It was n't really big , there was about thirty of us , about a dozen er waggon repairers and er and er a apprentices . ###And of course then you 'd got the er you 'd got the mill , er and then , of course , the blacksmith 's shop . 
82050:85	###It was n't really big , there was about thirty of us , about a dozen er waggon repairers and er and er a apprentices . ###And of course then you 'd got the er you 'd got the mill , er and then , of course , the blacksmith 's shop . 
82051:35	###And of course then you 'd got the er you 'd got the mill , er and then , of course , the blacksmith 's shop . ###You see , all the iron work , as you took it off , it had to be straightened out , and if it was broken it had to be rewelded . 
82074:13	###Something like that . ###Mm . 
82076:7	###And er we had to walk to Long Eaton three times and week , which would be , from here , would be two and a half mile away , and then we 'd we er on the Friday It was Mondays , Wednesdays and and Fridays , and we got paid on the Friday . ###And you was given a time to go in to sign on . 
82079:19	###We was er given a time to go and er it was anything after nine o' clock , in the morning . ###I see . 
82111:202	###Mm . ###Well of course then you get a hot summer and it er it er revealed the cracks and the breaks , see ? 
82113:46	###Now er when we 'd done a waggon er it was n't just er right , that 's alright , er we had a railway examiner come along and er he 'd go round it and if there was anything as he was was n't satisfied with , or any other further repairs , he he 'd stop that waggon from going out , and er of course we had to go r go back and do it . ###Of course we got paid for that as well . 
82135:65	###Yes . ###So what happened during the second world war ? 
82150:10	###Yes . ###Er I think I had two years in the Home Guard . 
82159:9	###So you were n't allowed to go along ? ###No , I was n't allowed to go with . 
82161:15	###So I had to stay back in er in Stapleford , the Stapleford Home Guard . ###Mind you , it was er it wa was n't er really dangerous because , of course , they , as you know , the the Germans never came . 
82167:37	###Rifles , and bayonets , , but the bayonets and rifles were kep at the drill hall at Stapleford . ###I see . 
82195:34	###Yes , you got a weekly compensation . ###I see . 
82206:90	###So ? ###And er but a man a married man , it was twenty two shilling a week , you see ? 
82276:35	###And what was that like ? ###Well , i it was n't too bad at all , they the tailor 's shop actually , it was er a tailor and his wife , who had built up a business over the years , in Stapleford , and it was very well patronized by Stapleford people . 
82276:129	###And what was that like ? ###Well , i it was n't too bad at all , they the tailor 's shop actually , it was er a tailor and his wife , who had built up a business over the years , in Stapleford , and it was very well patronized by Stapleford people . 
82277:12	###Well , i it was n't too bad at all , they the tailor 's shop actually , it was er a tailor and his wife , who had built up a business over the years , in Stapleford , and it was very well patronized by Stapleford people . ###But , at fourteen , my job was to er I had to fetch the coal and the sticks , to light the er stove that held the irons , and er they they were er d I I Like I had to go to the coalhouse which was down fourteen steps , the steps were wooden ones , outside the upper floor , where we worked . 
82280:23	###And so that , it made me a tougher than I should have been . ###And also the irons were twenty two pound , they were long , flat arrangements , called goose irons . 
82286:39	###And in the other room , there were two rooms , and the other room had a buttonhole machine , which was quite modern in those days , not many firms had a buttonhole machine . ###And I was there until I was about eighteen . 
82286:68	###And in the other room , there were two rooms , and the other room had a buttonhole machine , which was quite modern in those days , not many firms had a buttonhole machine . ###And I was there until I was about eighteen . 
82291:92	###Er it erm er the result was that you was really working flat out all the summer , and then as the winter advanced , you got very short of work , and they put us on the dole , for half a week . ###We worked a wee half a week and were on the dole , Monday , Tuesday and Wednesday we 'd be on the dole , then work Thursday , Friday and Saturday morning . 
82294:42	###And the result was we were often working till half past three without any lunch at all . ###And we used to get very worked up about it , and then we went down to fetch our wages , and the older ones were always going to complain , but this erm tt er son of the people , he used to look at the factory clock opposite , and it would be half past three , and he 'd said , Right , I 'll pay you till three o' clock , and we 'll make it right next week . 
82300:73	###And where did you work after that ? ###Well at about er when I was about eighteen , I erm I decided I 'd had enough of this er this business of three days on the three days on , and three off , in the winter , and it was about October time and I could see another winter of it . 
82310:91	###They were very surprised , because usually they advertised for them , but they went up and asked the tailors if they wanted anyone , and then a dear old man , a er named Mr said he like a trouser finisher . ###And he worked on his own on these trousers , you see ? 
82315:11	###Unlike Gillens a fixed rate for the week , it was then piece work . ###But our rate was fixed , the girls 's rate We worked for a fixed rate . 
82316:19	###But our rate was fixed , the girls 's rate We worked for a fixed rate . ###But the men had to balance it up by , what they called chits , tha that came on every garment and how much er money they were getting for it . 
82330:45	###You see , that was the same system , the piece work , to say there was no trade at all . ###There 'd been some snow , and erm er he was n't well , and could I if I cared I could look for a work elsewhere , as i it was just impossible for him to pay wages , you see ? 
82332:157	###So as the shop , you see , did n't pay the wages , they had to just pay it on the things that were done . ###And so then I So I was very , very disappointed and I went to a shop then called Dixon-Parkers which was a bigger shop and er a very well-known shop . 
82333:104	###And so then I So I was very , very disappointed and I went to a shop then called Dixon-Parkers which was a bigger shop and er a very well-known shop . ###And I went in there , and asked for their tailoring department and er er I found out after that I was just dead lucky , one of their trouser finishers was going to er leave , she was getting married , and she was leaving and erm although you did n't have to leave then , she she she sort of had got to leave , so er I just fell lucky , there . 
82353:42	###Conditions were poor , really , in that respect . ###But er , it was just the thing , they thought inevitable in a tailor 's workroom . 
82384:35	###I it 's er never held me up that much , but er it obviously it affected er me throat , the erm It 's the bits off the new cloth , you see ? ###You 've always got the new cloth , and er and I think the heat , in the summer , with the stoves going and everything , contributed to it . 
82389:28	###And erm tt and then I was there twenty two weeks , as a patient , and er the then the only cure was rest and good food , and fresh air . ###And fresh air we got , it was all open to the weather , I once remember putting an umbrella up , because it snowed on the bed . 
82392:184	###It was at Ransom Sanatorium , it was beautiful round there , but very isolated . ###And once you 'd recovered , you left there , did you ? 
82469:33	###memory for you ? ###Yeah . 
82471:44	###The General Strike , it 's a strange memory because I had to walk down Pad er now , erm I forget what the proper word is now , er it 's called Walk , now . ###sounds terr er terrible to me , because Pad was the way to Colliery , the last half mile along a dirt track . 
82492:86	###Mm . ###W was the Strike a period of hardship particularly ? 
82515:9	###Erm , yes . ###My grandfather became involved because ' s union er made a big thing out of compensation cases . 
82519:54	###Do you think the two were connected , then ? ###Oh , we 're sure they were but er this was the thing with a private collier company where you had er a sort of , not quite chairman , of the colliery sitting there at the top o in the office , watching everybody come and go . 
82613:7	###So What other memories do you have of of , then ? ###Oh , very happy memories really , we erm we had two or three masters from , erm one was the Sunday School superintendent , again this chapel and the son-in-law of the headmaster of Street , George Edward , , as he 's known to thousands . 
82613:48	###So What other memories do you have of of , then ? ###Oh , very happy memories really , we erm we had two or three masters from , erm one was the Sunday School superintendent , again this chapel and the son-in-law of the headmaster of Street , George Edward , , as he 's known to thousands . 
82627:87	###Mm . ###How did you go about finding a job ? 
82628:33	###How did you go about finding a job ? ###Wrote hundreds of letter , er to the people you wanted to do , because I 'd never expected having to find a job , I must admit , because the year before I took School Certificate I had got a Naval a artificer apprenticeship , but then I got kicked in the eye playing rugby , and failed a medical . 
82650:96	###So what did you actually do in the rating office ? ###Well , I wrote out births , deaths , marriage certificates , and er then measured up houses on the rating side , erm worked them out for evaluations . 
82655:28	###Erm but er I learnt to write a fair hand , erm without too many flourishes , which er because I was always told that somebody might be looking at this in a hundred years time , or more . ###Mm . 
82656:31	###Mm . ###In going to measure houses , did you have to actually go out and visit houses ? 
82721:18	###Erm then there was the er and he m Dr , and er Dr and then it became Dr , who is still there . ###Erm Dr was the medical officer of health , part time , and Dr was a character , he always had a white carnation , he rode round in a carriage on occasions , and he er wrote copperplate . 
82725:12	###Erm myocardio degeneration and chronic bronchitis , and erm probably quite accurate , but er short of breaking your neck I think you , bronchitis was the killer , in . ###Mm . 
82726:17	###Mm . ###So yo you had to fill in births and deaths certificates ? 
82861:18	###I see . ###And they could afford to pay the shilling or one and sixpence to have their fireplaces done . 
82890:89	###Of these allotments , er I do n't know how many square yards each one would be , but that was his sort of spare time sort of work , occupation . ###And and what sort of , when did he have ti , when did he go to the allotment , can you remember ? 
82948:26	###And er when that was done the washing the mangle was always in the yard , in the backyard , the old mangle with the wooden rollers and it was quite an effort to turn and we children very often ha to give a turn . ###Was erm always kept in the yard , there was no room for it in a small scullery , and there were big old wooden rollers . 
82948:61	###And er when that was done the washing the mangle was always in the yard , in the backyard , the old mangle with the wooden rollers and it was quite an effort to turn and we children very often ha to give a turn . ###Was erm always kept in the yard , there was no room for it in a small scullery , and there were big old wooden rollers . 
82949:32	###Was erm always kept in the yard , there was no room for it in a small scullery , and there were big old wooden rollers . ###And as I say you used to have to erm children used to hav well the elder children had to give a turn with the mangling . 
83006:7	###And quite big families were brought up in some of these houses with only two bedrooms . ###It 's amazing really , I do n't know how they used to and there were only two of us . 
83043:14	###Erm oh I should be a good mile , a good mile , and that 's that 's another little story there . ###That you never hear or see today . 
83079:8	###She was a good provider , my my mother was . ###And erm in her particular way she was quite a good cook too . 
83079:23	###She was a good provider , my my mother was . ###And erm in her particular way she was quite a good cook too . 
83080:7	###And erm in her particular way she was quite a good cook too . ###They had to be , they had to be . 
83109:33	###There were no houses , it was all fields beyond there . ###And erm we used to kick this tin down the hill and er as I say it would roll down and we would all go and hide anywhere , back garden , front garden , over a wall , round a corner , anywhere like that you see . 
83112:163	###And then there was another game we used to play was called Peggy . ###And er the er we used to have a piece of wood , a small piece of wood that was shaped er like a sort of almost like torpedo at both ends . 
83115:51	###Oh I see . ###could . 
83146:82	###But this used to happen , this used to happen . ###Aye , we 've done all sorts of things , there was er I used to go to chapel as well I I we were we were compelled to go to chapel . 
83157:228	###time 's very very short you know . ###The anniversaries , they used to be every Easter time , an anniversary , for which the boys invariably got a new little suit , and the girls had a new frock . 
83161:232	###Yes well at the end of the the the er service or anniversary , whatever , I do n't know if it was called a service or not . ###Erm there was an appeal , for the for the collection plate that was going round . 
83184:23	###Did it , what did you think about , did you mind going to Sunday School ? ###Well I did n't mind till I got a bit older , then I sort of started to kick , and er as I got older , that 's another story . 
83309:7	###Because of the horses . ###He was very lucky . 
83319:121	###In fact it was far worse than it is today you know . ###Er they grumble about it today but when you think there there there was very little dole in those days , very little dole . 
83319:231	###In fact it was far worse than it is today you know . ###Er they grumble about it today but when you think there there there was very little dole in those days , very little dole . 
83320:32	###Er they grumble about it today but when you think there there there was very little dole in those days , very little dole . ###I mean I can remember the nineteen twenty , I I were n't sure whether it was the twenty one or the twenty six strike , and my father was erm on strike , you see , but the ponies had to be thus cared for in the field an I do n't think he received any pay and I remember very well erm going to the , my father applying for relief , and er we had to go and face the erm Court of Referees . 
83330:84	###Government yes . ###Like it would be D H S S today you see . 
83332:25	###And erm anyway they went into all your means , and what you 'd got and what you had n't got , I think my father had to sell his cycle . ###And then we were down to five shillings a week , there was four of us you see , five shillings a week relief . 
83333:40	###And then we were down to five shillings a week , there was four of us you see , five shillings a week relief . ###And erm the provivo proviso was that you had to pay it back though . 
83372:99	###No I I , she had a machine , we had a sewing machine , I could tell you a story about that but I wo n't . ###Er she had a sewing machine , she used to make er sort of shirts but not suits and things like that she did n't , she repaired them . 
83373:30	###Er she had a sewing machine , she used to make er sort of shirts but not suits and things like that she did n't , she repaired them . ###You 'd have a patch you see and your trousers would be patched , and er I had no brothers to sort of hand-me-downs so of course mine we went had to be worn out , and erm you 're normal attire in those days was a er a pair of trousers and a jersey , you did n't have a suit as such . 
83398:14	###And the and the toilet the toilet was adjacent to the , was built on to the house . ###But a lot of them at the bottom of the garden . 
83407:88	###But erm I erm I recall as well the shops that we were talking about . ###I 'm not sure , the grocer 's shop erm , now er they did credit trading in those days and most people took the credit . 
83410:47	###And if you did n't pay for it at the weekend you got no groceries next week . ###Mm . 
83434:41	###Oh I see . ###And take so much off and pat it up and then then wrap it , very nice and neatly . 
83441:58	###And er the then again that that 's all all changed . ###Erm even the chemist shop as such has changed . 
83441:75	###And er the then again that that 's all all changed . ###Erm even the chemist shop as such has changed . 
83474:12	###And erm you used to cut it into the basket in the corner . ###And 
83549:32	###Then you replaced that , that was saving your heels . ###This was for economy 's sake you see , you could n't afford to buy shoes like people buy them now and just throw them away . 
83578:16	###People used to whitewash their ceilings . ###Erm with whitewash not with er emulsion , that was too expensive , they 'd buy a packet of a packet of which would make so many gallons of whitewash and you 'd whitewash the ceiling . 
83588:79	###You had a turn out then and I think it lasted till the next spring , not like taking curtains up and down like people do now and hoover for the carpets , course the carpet would be taken out and beaten as you as you know , they were n't they were slung onto a line and beaten with anything that was handy . ###There was no such thing as a vacuum cleaners or anything like that you know.And er er that 's just how it went on . 
83589:87	###There was no such thing as a vacuum cleaners or anything like that you know.And er er that 's just how it went on . ###It was an amazing thing really when I when I look back and think about the decoration side of it because , those fireplaces were had to be seen to be believed because they were , if the wind was in the wrong , you we , the room was full of smoke . 
83589:137	###There was no such thing as a vacuum cleaners or anything like that you know.And er er that 's just how it went on . ###It was an amazing thing really when I when I look back and think about the decoration side of it because , those fireplaces were had to be seen to be believed because they were , if the wind was in the wrong , you we , the room was full of smoke . 
83603:35	###And there was this long building on the er the other side of the er yard . ###Now the down floor or or the ground floor er th was the girls , and the assembly hall , the big assembly hall , and the boys classrooms were above the girls , you went upstairs , you see onto one wing . 
83617:61	###Oh yes , yes yes , oh yes , it was just d if you was if you was behind then it was just too bad . ###Because erm even going back to those days it was the bright ones that were pushed forward and the the sort of dog take the hinder most sort of thing you know . 
83623:31	###And er I do n't know they seemed to be sort of more worldly wide in many respects . ###Probably were n't I do n't know but they seemed to us I may be looking at it from a child 's eyes but er that 's how they seemed to be to me . 
83660:79	###Cane . ###With a cane . 
83660:124	###Cane . ###With a cane . 
83675:33	###When he he he evaded going to school , play truant . ###He he very rarely played truant a boy did n't it 's er in fact I er I do n't think I ever did , to my knowledge played truant at all during school . 
83696:43	###Very much so . ###Very much so . 
83696:121	###Very much so . ###Very much so . 
83705:14	###The whole of the school would join in that , boys and girls were together , they were se segregated in the hall you did n't sit next to a girl or anything like that , the boys were on one side , the girls were on the other side . ###But the the Christmas party was something out of this world . 
83705:150	###The whole of the school would join in that , boys and girls were together , they were se segregated in the hall you did n't sit next to a girl or anything like that , the boys were on one side , the girls were on the other side . ###But the the Christmas party was something out of this world . 
83720:16	###And er the trestles and the tables were all laid down the assembly hall and then we had a er er after the erm when you had your your meal , which consisted of sandwiches and cake , that was all . ###It was n't a knife and fork effort at all . 
83740:26	###Now these things used to break windows obviously , you can imagine it ca n't you ? ###And that 's why they were called a window breaker these tops . 
83743:7	###Or your parents did . ###There was none of this running away and , I have n't done it , and this that and the other . 
83792:10	###The case was that her mum 's house was overcrowded . ###Yeah . 
83885:8	###So ###Yeah . 
83960:9	###No way am I living in another flat , no chance . ###I mean my parents wo n't visit me cos I living here . 
83963:9	###So we 're losing out as , you know we 're losing out all the time . ###No one that no one 'll visit you . 
84024:11	###Mind it 's pretty warm anyway without the heating on really . ###But when you want to heat the bedrooms up you ca n't , unless you only have it on for a bit you know . 
84045:12	###things that are a bit , the repairs have been alright really . ###Yeah . 
84045:32	###things that are a bit , the repairs have been alright really . ###Yeah . 
84104:12	###and get things from it . ###And her sister who lives next door but one from her mums , she done the same thing . 
84133:109	###cos it 's it 's cheaper anyway . ###Yeah . 
84133:161	###cos it 's it 's cheaper anyway . ###Yeah . 
84133:184	###cos it 's it 's cheaper anyway . ###Yeah . 
84157:9	###You know for me Sunday dinner . ###And food a week we 'll have fishfingers or beefburgers or things like that , pastas . 
84160:9	###You know what what I 'm gonna have for each meal over the ###So that 
84175:9	###No I nip over to the shop and get it from near . ###You know you get seven bottles for a token . 
84230:12	###You 're stupid taking things like that cos it ruins you . ###Mhm . 
84568:38	###And many of those either lived in the flats or in the surrounding surrounding streets . ###Mhm . 
84707:7	###It did improve the image and it it improved people 's confidence I think in themselves and in the area . ###Mhm . 
84718:51	###Mhm . ###And obviously it 's had an impact on the row of shops out on Road for example . 
84824:45	###And it 's hard you know , Ho How do you deal with it ? ###I dunno . 
84990:12	###I mean there were there were still quite a lot of tenants who wanted to see police patrolling in twos and threes , through the complex . ###But there were also a lot of people who felt that the presence of er of police in twos and threes , actually inflamed problems in the flats rather than cooled them down . 
85099:10	###home . ###Er several of the girls who had been in the mother and baby home , were housed in the flats . 
85124:84	###I came in knowing that that was going to happen , so erm yo I think also I had the the freedom that I had chosen to live there , and I think that made erm the difference . ###I put up with with it then , knowing that I had chosen it . 
85138:16	###something I mean we moved out of the flats , partly because the flats were coming down , ###Yeah . 
85179:10	###And erm it was just the same as any other day . ###Mhm . 
85206:51	###Well I certainly did n't find it any more dangerous living in the flats , than I would have found living in . ###And I did n't feel any more afraid , walking into the flats , than I would have felt walking on the road at night you know in in where I 'd been before . 
85405:12	###Only erm on occasions when we needed repairs done . ###Mhm . 
85436:50	###Erm when we moved into the flat , at first , there was actually a telephone box on the deck . ###And just outside our place , but it was often erm out of order . 
85499:11	###Mhm . ###What was it about the setup that you 'd be most critical of ? 
85574:37	###How does it make you feel as a person human consequence . ###It makes me sad , it makes me angry and erm I do n't know erm what other feelings it causes in me . 
85674:24	###And erm come here a young girl and a baby , and helping to install her in in on one of the flats , and just sort of e th there was something erm happened to be wrong with one of the rubbish chutes at that time , and we were actually kicking our way through rubbish on the stairs , erm near the chute to to get erm to come up . ###And I think that really erm horrified me . 
85714:114	###I know you mentioned something erm earlier on . ###Erm perhaps when we today , about erm clothing that you managed to get together 
85737:105	###Er but certainly I I mean like , I mentioned before what a what areas like need is is erm certainly more money being put in to actually providing the facilities . ###Whether it 's living facilities , or erm for facilities for people to use , er that certainly needs to be done . 
85830:135	###Mhm . ###And we also have given out food erm and money for food . 
85857:233	###Mhm . ###And what kind of impact is that likely to have , the cutback on single payments ? 
85905:33	###but for what I am . ###Mhm . 
85915:14	###You know , that that that ###Mhm . 
85923:87	###Mhm . ###Erm and you know there 's er you know really er it 's something that we 're not the only ones who make the decision . 
85924:40	###Erm and you know there 's er you know really er it 's something that we 're not the only ones who make the decision . ###While we actually do the a the removal , we usually have other agencies with us such as the N S P C C , the police , who have to carry out the investigation into what has actually happened , and erm in the end the court . 
85971:29	###Erm do you know you you 've you spoke erm earlier erm about the church , erm how do you see how so you se do you see the role of the church , erm in ar in er inner cities ? ###What what do you think they could do do ? 
85978:21	###And er just sort of by their lives , becoming relevant as well . ###Mhm . 
86265:9	###It would n't tell you how many swallows , it would tell you how many lots of six swallows would east that . ###Then you multiply it by six . 
86500:34	###But one way of looking at it is , Well the job takes forty eight man hours . ###Forty eight man hours . 
86532:18	###So if you 'd like er we do n't know how many men . ###Let 's say it 's X . 
86607:22	###Thirty six man hours in this job . ###Okay . 
86630:72	###Nine men . ###Yeah . 
86911:53	###You 're told that that particular function is equal to that . ###Mm . 
86911:77	###You 're told that that particular function is equal to that . ###Mm . 
86919:46	###A function of a number . ###Mm . 
87067:34	###Function X in brackets ###Mm . 
87247:53	###And you can see what this this is in function notation , which is most commonly used , and it 's easier to understand , than the mapping notation , most people find . ###Yeah . 
87282:13	###G of three , G of three squared plus one . ###G of three . 
87395:23	###So what would G of seven be , it would be three times seven minus two . ###But what 's G of this lot ? 
87480:40	###Erm ###Cos he reckons that paper three does give you some 
87628:15	###Not a hundred percent that 's ###yeah . 
87781:9	###And then what about B ? ###Please calculate the area of lawn remaining . 
87798:67	###So you should n't be having any problem with those anyway . ###In the diagram , a rhombus , each side of length three centimetres , put X in inside . 
87834:49	###Right . ###So it 's got to be down here . 
87938:15	###They will often tell you what scale to use as well . ###Which they do here . 
88464:14	###I ca n't find time for you , ###Yeah . 
88645:7	###Or work out what I 'm doing here , maybe make a little , few little notes to yourself . ###Mm . 
88646:35	###Mm . ###I must do that bit and that before that . 
88755:24	###Amen . ###The er hopeful line I think , in that psalm is the first one , Make a joyful noise to the Lord , all the lands . 
88944:12	###Anglican ###Yeah . 
88950:17	###Mm . ###Again it 's it 's children percent 
88987:27	###the sport and so on and er and then what time you 're gonna go for . ###And alternatively we do a bit of research and find out if some compromise can be arranged . 
88992:24	###Erm ###I think , just moving it earlier , I s completely support what Bill just said , does n't actually solve the problem . 
89069:41	###And he says , he always looks out to see who is the f the local Friar Tuck . ###And er this particular minister was all everyone was sort of looking in his direction and pointing . 
89127:55	###I think we can all get the flavour of what the message is about even if we do n't understand all the language . ###I mean it 's a bit like watching the television while you 're doing the ironing . 
89153:9	###As regards anything else . ###The issue is that you know we build ourselves round the church . 
89161:9	###And nothing to do with the running of . ###My experience , just to take one example of non-sexist language , and when I was in college in the mid eighties , it was the thing you know . 
89245:29	###And you can talk about erm er adoration , shall we say , as long as you explain to them what adoration means . ###Erm and I think it 's exactly the same with some of the words that you know that I quoted earlier . 
89329:39	###And you start with , I started with those three things , and worked out three essential messages . ###Not at all linked , okay . 
89335:8	###Erm and I a work of God 's grace a in us to make us like that . ###Now how do you then , starting from that standpoint , bring that you know into everyday language . 
89359:44	###going round , is it still plugged in ? ###It I think . 
89380:13	###And one of the prime moves for all age worship when it first started , was to say , you know , if Christian education is going to take place at other times , than on a Sunday , then what do we do together , for all ages , in worship . ###You know if the children are not going to go out , and the adults are not going to have their own education classes , which let 's be honest most of us do n't attend or or have anything to do with . 
89391:22	###Now that is I mean all age worship every Sunday ? ###Yes why not ? 
89434:105	###Right . ###And I think when you 're little you do n't really understand and , unless your parents tell you , then 
89437:39	###sincerity ###You know , I ca n't exactly sort of quote you word for word . 
89437:49	###sincerity ###You know , I ca n't exactly sort of quote you word for word . 
89478:13	###Oh right yes . ###she was born again . 
89577:23	###Of course and then she dies and erm I went back to me own mother you see . ###Why why did you with your grandmother ? 
89578:231	###Why why did you with your grandmother ? ###I do n't know my grandmother must have took to me . 
89589:14	###Of course there was no gas fires about then . ###no gas fires . 
89590:7	###no gas fires . ###You used to have to cook everything on your fire . 
89599:9	###Oh I see . ###And on that side , what we fireplace it used to be what we used to call a boiler , you used to fill it with water and it used to the fire used to heat it for you to take it we used to call what we used to call ladle it out into a a bowl to wash your pots with or wash your floor with or anything with . 
89645:14	###telling you that . ###She used to mind you in them days you there was no er fitted carpets on your floor . 
89647:14	###You used to have to scrub them . ###And er just the same as your table there was no er polish top tables when I was little . 
89651:16	###And they were like that and then of course they used to be er no washing machines you used to be at these here tubs . ###And there used to be a rub board . 
89651:132	###And they were like that and then of course they used to be er no washing machines you used to be at these here tubs . ###And there used to be a rub board . 
89657:51	###They used to In the lace market there used to be factories what used to make lace er and er a lady used to er go and take fetch so much lace out and she used to give it out to people what wanted to do it . ###They used to call it drawing or clipping and scalloping you see . 
89677:11	###Why ###Well cos she d she could n't do it . 
89696:16	###Did n't know how to do them . ###And they used to erm er get this er net or lace right what they were gonna what they after it 'd been starched and everything . 
89704:42	###There used to be one woman one end and one woman the other , with something like something similar to the shape as a ladder . ###And er get and then strip this er at the side , cos a girl used to be at the front to strip all this here lace of these here pins . 
89720:26	###Ooh she worked there for years me mother did . ###But but how many hours a day did she work there ? 
89894:69	###Such as what ? ###What sort of job ?

90393:45	###I was taken into hospital and the er with er malaria and bronchitis . ###With one doctor , one nurse made me one of the doctors told me to get up . 
90417:63	###And we got into M into Southampton when she was loading up again . ###By God it you 've seen some ships you when you see them , they 're something to look at . 
90475:7	###I went to work Monday and I could n't get out come downstairs for the week I was that stiff . ###But the promises with work that we had when we went in the army , you j you 'd be looked after We got the worst damn place anybody could . 
90484:7	###And it were about that height . ###Now up about five or si about five foot up in height . 
90494:33	###And it we tried to open all three together sometimes you know . ###It used to cause a hell of a me a hell of a draft . 
90497:7	###I u I went in one there was like a junction as come from Pit into . ###The towards th pit bottom like . 
90508:7	###He finished up at at at but he was the under-manager at . ###And that was er under John John was the manager and er I tell you Scott come and he started swearing at me and I says , I did n't m ask you for your bloody job , so next er next morning when they goes , he they had they had me walking the rope . 
90514:31	###This particular day he comes round to me , he says , Take this lamp , he said , Bugger off down there , he says , and thou can the coal I 'm coming . ###So I do and do his lamp job . 
90666:59	###And er it was a good night 's work . ###The fire brigade eventually turned up , because the police had cancelled they tu turned them ou turned them out again . 
90711:110	###And let them them deal with it . ###We we 'll do the reporting and that 's that 's as far as we 'll go . 
90872:9	###Yeah . ###and whereas before we could walk round in a on a circular route , Yeah that 's Walk . 
90907:23	###You can walk down here , do n't walk down here at nighttime if it 's er if it 's chock-a-block . ###Alright then . 
90923:80	###I think we 've walked past the one that 's been set on fire . ###I dunno . 
90977:10	###Went upstairs and there was water pouring out the electrics . ###Tried the alarm , their alarm like , obviously they had n't switched it on . 
91203:18	###And er you st see he had like this ###Mhm . 
91203:38	###And er you st see he had like this ###Mhm . 
91238:42	###Did you f did you feel did you feel safe living in the flats now ? ###Do you feel safe ? 
91378:7	###So that that just stopped did it in the end . ###It was 
91403:16	###There there was supposed to . ###Mhm . 
91618:9	###Mhm . ###She was in the hospital a long while . 
91624:7	###It never took . ###They 're supposed to take you know . 
91723:22	###Could n't put mats on the floor . ###Over the d over the windows it was coming in . 
91780:12	###Well there was one at the end at en e at the end of er Walk . ###Mhm . 
91928:33	###What are you go what are you going there for . ###All . 
92076:89	###You see I were born in nineteen hundred so that means to say that when it 's nineteen ninety eight I 'll be ninety eight , I think they did that so I could er reckon me age up more easily . ###But nineteen thirteen I went to this examination and it was called a Labour Examination , and if you were able to pass this examination you could leave school at thirteen . 
92120:13	###And er so he never had any sleep that night , well that was the that 's a story about them days . ###How how did you feel about trade unionism then ? 
92186:152	###And I was in in Alexandria , and er and that was it , that was my twenty first birthday there you see . ###And anyway when we got back to England er we went to Aldershot , and was n't there long . 
92187:53	###And anyway when we got back to England er we went to Aldershot , and was n't there long . ###But while we were there they had several meetings because of course we were going to be demobbed anyway , and the Colonel er of the regiment he had us together and so did the officers , and warned us that when we got back to civilian life we must er beware of these agitators who tried to er create suspicion amongst the troops who were coming back , and telling them that they ought to join er these revolutionary parties . 
92202:35	###And we got the union to er all all they did was to help us , was to pay for the text books that we had . ###If you see we 'd got about er twenty eight thirty in this class , and er they bought the text books and we joined a national college of labour colleges . 
92216:130	###And er he he was having a conference in , course with dropping out of the Labour Party , the Labour Party finished with him and did n't bother and anyw he he someone I do n't know who it was , it was n't him himself but someone told me that he was looking for somebody to organize this conference in , so I said , Well I I 'll do it . ###And er so this student came to and I organized a conference and took the chair for him you know and er and helped him every possible way . 
92217:19	###And er so this student came to and I organized a conference and took the chair for him you know and er and helped him every possible way . ###And he er and he was really delighted of course , so he said , Well I 'm holiday and I 'll come round with the caravan , so I had my holiday which did n't make much difference because there was had to you know we were n't working really , and I went round with him for this week , all round and the villages everywhere . 
92259:41	###He 'd only go for a couple of hours to his London office . ###A b on on one day he he went earlier and he had his lunch in London , he said , and there was another man on the table and er the both reached for the salt together and upset it and there was apologies and talks and then he discovered that he was the buyer for the London County Council . 
92271:9	###He said , I 'm going , he said , But , he said , I 've got to , I 've got to take the s the , this millionaire ran this firm and his name was if I remember right . ###He said , I 've got to take his stupid son with me . 
92339:54	###Did n't you know that ? ###Oh yeah . 
92356:8	###Aye , and there were very few people caught you know for when the the the particularly buses , which was a blackleg firm , they used to tip their buses over . ###They 'd never let them run from to . 
92402:32	###Oh I was very , I have n't seen him for a while , being ill you do n't , but er , he was always sending messages of good will when I was in hospital . ###Lionel 's a very he he he , you 'll enjoy him , he 'll be good . 
92471:15	###And er of course there were no pension , no widow 's pension , no nothing at all . ###And so there was er old age pension , state , there was nothing then you know nothing at all . 
92511:10	###I I I received , it was , it was , yes that 's right , until you get into the job , yeah . ###Five bob , and then you get on a piece rate . 
92517:17	###For sixpence . ###What did tu turning a sock actually involve ? 
92541:25	###Usually pretty fairly . ###How did you feel about pi your own people sort of being transferred into positions of authority , was there much resentment ? 
92580:19	###That 's right . ###Yeah , you just mentioned the Wars , you remember much about the War in in ? 
92633:14	###Oh aye . ###And er the police used to take them in black marias some of them . 
92661:25	###Was the was the lawyer paid for by the union ? ###Oh aye , oh aye . 
92739:9	###Presumably if if all the finishing companies erm ###Supported us . 
92763:12	###Er ye yes and n no really . ###Everybody coming from military service er was er got the job back there were no question about that at all , you got your job back . 
92835:33	###Er all those that finished was in the finishing union , yeah . ###How come , how did you get to be involved in the union after the War ? 
93031:14	###Did they did ###Except 
93095:24	###Oh er now th that was that was that was pretty poor , er probably employed in the co-op in those days , would would have attracted er er er a fourteen shillings , er nearly half as much again . ###Er , perhaps in the mining industry , you would have got er thirteen shillings , something like this . 
93124:188	###Now this , this may this may appear , this may this may may be a this may appear to be a a a something farfetched , might this . ###This is exactly what the situation was . 
93167:11	###But it was warm , er and er meals were provided for them . ###And do you have any specific memories of er the hunger marches ? 
93256:78	###Messing about with the wi wi with the er food . ###Now , what about other things ? 
93354:26	###But er you got to Paris , you got an address in Paris , they gave you a bed , couple of meals ###Now who who ga who supplied the money ? 
93440:17	###You do n't know whether he did it from an entrepreneur 's point of view , or from er ###No . 
93440:32	###You do n't know whether he did it from an entrepreneur 's point of view , or from er ###No . 
93487:14	###Er , well , they had a difficult job , they had a difficult job you see , because they 'd got to keep explaining to you why you had n't got a rifle . ###And er and when you 're fighting a war , you see and er and and and er and you have n't got a rifle , I mean it 's a serious problem . 
93675:9	###And policemen do n't like to see it . ###But what do they do ? 
93809:13	###Erm I mean a are there rela what what what would you say are the related crimes to prostitution ? ###Well I think you 're moving on now to a sphere where perhaps C I D could you know help you on that . 
93859:7	###Erm Let 's go on to the next question now about erm Just wondering what what on what cir under what circumstances , the police get involved in domestic disturbances on the flats ? ###Well every domestic I go to , I look at as a potential murder . 
93982:16	###Erm you know , some people would say you know , er seeing the kind of publicity that has had , that it would be it might be quite risky to er to o open the business of a building society here . ###Erm so what kind of what kind of research goes into into erm choosing where to actually site one ? 
94018:44	###The fact the fact that erm this branch is erm situated in a fairly disadvantaged erm area , erm does that have any implications at all ? ###Or not ? 
94041:19	###Previously I 've worked in city centre environments . ###Which I have enjoyed it 's been er a bit of a challenge coming here because in the city centre , business-wise , you 're surrounded by the professions such as estate agents and solicitors . 
94043:49	###And the membership , your investors had to actually make the effort to come to you . ###Whereas here the situation is reversed . 
94055:13	###So what do you think about that ? ###Yes with with the membership being on the doorstep , we do get to know them a lot better . 
94103:13	###Erm I think very many people live in the flats sort of thing , and and they 're going to need rehousing . ###A lot of them are going out of the area , but I think er I 'd imagine that a large majority or a a large proportion certainly would wish to stay in . 
94109:12	###Mhm . ###Er the present flat site . 
94205:7	###Mhm . ###That 's right . 
94330:10	###I mean er now we 're in the second flow of them being emptied again , so I do n't know what 's gonna happen for the future . ###Mhm . 
94357:21	###Mhm . ###And er well now I think there 's a lot of things that you ca n't purchase on this road . 
94392:7	###Yeah . ###Yeah . . 
94393:20	###Yeah . . ###There must be a lot of pride actually in it then Erm 
94397:7	###Mhm . ###Yes . 
94483:14	###Mhm . ###Am I right in saying that you 've also been very you 've also changed with the times as well , and adjusted 
94485:10	###Well we sort of had to obviously . ###Yeah . 
94495:19	###mhm . ###Or a a different type of livestock maybe better word cos i do n't know You ca n't really count chickens and pigeons as in the way of pets . 
94622:91	###That er when you get these these er er reputations or whatever it is , it takes an awful lot of living down . ###And I think a lot of people outside the area , perhaps do not accept it . 
94729:9	###I understand further up the road there are . ###Mhm . 
94900:15	###Now I think it just leaves me to give the notices out . ###Erm we 've got our Bring and Buy later and I see everybody 's remembered to bring something , thank you very much . 
94919:59	###But that 's what I thought , so I thought I 'll try and be a doctor . ###So I did my O levels and my A levels and I then went to the London Hospital , which is in Whitechapel , from the age of eighteen until I was twenty three . 
94920:72	###So I did my O levels and my A levels and I then went to the London Hospital , which is in Whitechapel , from the age of eighteen until I was twenty three . ###And God was very good to me there , I was n't the brightest in the year and I had to work very hard , but God always was with me as I always passed my exams much to my surprise . 
94921:23	###And God was very good to me there , I was n't the brightest in the year and I had to work very hard , but God always was with me as I always passed my exams much to my surprise . ###What you do for the first two years is you learn all the theory of being a doctor and you go and you have to between eight of you , learn all about a body you have one body between of you and you learn all about all the muscles and the nerves 
94921:48	###And God was very good to me there , I was n't the brightest in the year and I had to work very hard , but God always was with me as I always passed my exams much to my surprise . ###What you do for the first two years is you learn all the theory of being a doctor and you go and you have to between eight of you , learn all about a body you have one body between of you and you learn all about all the muscles and the nerves 
94928:11	###digging all over my arm ###Oh . 
94932:14	###and finding out what , what our er stomachs were like , whether the , the liquid in there is acidic , whether it 's an acid and do you know the girls were braver than the boys , the boys would n't let anyone do that to them . ###Women are brave , that 's why 
94933:59	###Women are brave , that 's why ###And erm we had to learn erm how to do heart tracings , ECGs , on each other and er all sorts of exciting things like that . 
94935:36	###And then , after two years , we were allowed on to the wards in our white coats and we had to erm find out about the patients and initially we were all very slow and we were given two hours to talk to a patient to find out all about them . ###Now I 'm a G P we have ten minutes . 
94937:38	###And I can remember one of my first patients I had to take blood from , and it took me quite a few goes on that poor lady but she 's still friends with me so she 's forgiven me . ###We get sent all over erm the country , southern England I , I was sent to different hospitals to learn about different things , to learn about erm psychiatry and obstetrics and medicine and then erm you also do some er training back in your own hospital , but it 's not big enough for all the doctors to stay there all the time well the baby doctors . 
94952:203	###We also went down into the valley , into , we were on the edge of the Rift Valley , and there there were a different sort of people . ###Wher near our hospital they all liked to wear western clothes , they were a bit out of date but er the there , there were lots of T-shirts and s and dresses worn by the people , there was even a Blackpool T-shirt , I 'm not sure how they got in the shops . 
94954:14	###Erm but down in the Rift Valley the Pocot people were a very different tribe , they wore leather , little tiny leather skirts and cowrie shells and nothing here , and it was very very hot , and they were a nomadic people who erm moved about with their animals but because , when I was there , there 'd been a very bad drought , they 'd had to erm just beg really for food . ###So that was a contrast from the people near the hospital where I was and , what happened was , we used to do a little service and then anybody that wanted to be seen used to come along and we needed an interpreter and it was a bit like a surgery really , and they would come with any problems , and anyone who was severely ill we would then take back in the Landrover back to the hospital . 
94954:154	###Erm but down in the Rift Valley the Pocot people were a very different tribe , they wore leather , little tiny leather skirts and cowrie shells and nothing here , and it was very very hot , and they were a nomadic people who erm moved about with their animals but because , when I was there , there 'd been a very bad drought , they 'd had to erm just beg really for food . ###So that was a contrast from the people near the hospital where I was and , what happened was , we used to do a little service and then anybody that wanted to be seen used to come along and we needed an interpreter and it was a bit like a surgery really , and they would come with any problems , and anyone who was severely ill we would then take back in the Landrover back to the hospital . 
94960:16	###Ooh ###The water for drinking they used to collect from the gutters and erm it used to go into big barrels and then they used to boil it for a long while . 
94997:62	###Ooh ###and so sometimes the , the calls do seem unreasonable but you should n't get cross , and when you go and see them sometimes you realize why they 're anxious because something that might seem quite trivial to you they might know somebody who had similar symptoms and it actually turned out to be meningitis or something so you 're then able to put their minds at rest . 
95018:9	###And we went to one temple and it got dark whilst we were there , it was called the Monkey Temple , and it 's just so many monkeys around , and they just are allowed to run wild , but by the time we got back to our bikes it was dark and we had to cycle back in the dark without any lights on these unlit , unmade roads and that was quite frightening really . ###Mm 
95024:10	###Ooh ###from all the work they did . 
95033:30	###There 's a lot of rice that 's grown so in some areas the people can actually make a good living for themselves . ###The roads are hairpins , up and down , and they 're , they 're not tarmacked and so erm you often saw er buses that had fallen over the sides down into the river or that just were on their side , and that erm that obviously there 'd been accidents . 
95034:19	###The roads are hairpins , up and down , and they 're , they 're not tarmacked and so erm you often saw er buses that had fallen over the sides down into the river or that just were on their side , and that erm that obviously there 'd been accidents . ###Apparently what the erm busmen do is they have to make sure that they get to where they 're meant to be on time otherwise they get their pay docked but they like to stop off and see their friends on the way , and stop and have cups of tea 
95041:85	###Apparently that was on television last week , they were , did a programme about tigers do n't know whether anyone saw it . ###And erm we went on an elephant on a safari and we looked for erm wild animals and we saw some rhinos , and that was quite good fun . 
95048:105	###Ooh ###And then erm one afternoon we went in a dug out canoe erm to look for crocodiles and we did actually see them on the banks of the river as we were going down in our canoe , so that was quite exciting . 
95055:161	###But erm I think I had lots of people praying for me back here because I did n't have any problem with them and I was the only one who did n't . ###But there 's two ways of getting them off if they do latch on to you , one is to burn them off with a cigarette or a match and the other way is to use rock salt , and if you put rock salt on them they then just come off so that 's a little bit erm more humane for the leeches but it depends what you feel about them really as to whether you want to give them another chance . 
95064:66	###The last thing I thought I would talk about was my christian beliefs why I am here today why I am a doctor and what God means to me . ###Being brought up in a christian home is n't enough to make you a christian . 
95064:86	###The last thing I thought I would talk about was my christian beliefs why I am here today why I am a doctor and what God means to me . ###Being brought up in a christian home is n't enough to make you a christian . 
95065:14	###Being brought up in a christian home is n't enough to make you a christian . ###You can you go to church every Sunday , sing the choruses or the hymns , listen to what the man has to say or the lady has to say at the front , and it can just go over your head and it can mean nothing to you apart from something that you believe might be true . 
95065:54	###Being brought up in a christian home is n't enough to make you a christian . ###You can you go to church every Sunday , sing the choruses or the hymns , listen to what the man has to say or the lady has to say at the front , and it can just go over your head and it can mean nothing to you apart from something that you believe might be true . 
95085:82	###No-one comes to the father except through me . ###And that 's something that christians believe they have over all other faiths , that the only way to God is through Jesus Christ . 
95144:69	###Mm mm ###and erm sometimes that is very hard and I think you can be a missionary anywhere . 
95149:162	###Er presumably doctors also find this difficult do they ? ###It 's very hard not to put your own views on to other people 's lifestyles . 
95180:8	###They 're causing problems everywhere . ###And we pulled in in a car park in Brandon the other week and there in the middle of a car park was this ' orrible nappy . 
95180:16	###They 're causing problems everywhere . ###And we pulled in in a car park in Brandon the other week and there in the middle of a car park was this ' orrible nappy . 
95180:44	###They 're causing problems everywhere . ###And we pulled in in a car park in Brandon the other week and there in the middle of a car park was this ' orrible nappy . 
95403:29	###All this talk of chocolate is making me feel hungry , and chocolate is my special passion . ###I 'll be a link and join the chain . 
95450:92	###But when New Consumer was writing this book Global Consumer , a couple of years ago , they sent a questionnaire to Nestle . ###And erm the reply was , is the New Consumer seriously suggesting that Nestle pay in excess of market prices ? 
95491:83	###There 's a huge domestic market for tea in India . ###Sri Lanka part of the trouble is the civil war . 
95554:64	###I 'd want to know how much the people who are working on it at all stages are paid , if they 're paid a living wage . ###Mm . 
95556:19	###And I would want to know what the health effects were on them of the conditions in which they had to work . ###There was something happened to Nestle with regarding erm the mothers and the milk in Africa I 'm not quite sure what it was . 
95557:16	###There was something happened to Nestle with regarding erm the mothers and the milk in Africa I 'm not quite sure what it was . ###I think Nestle have had to change their policy , because they were selling it and advertising it , and it was obviously doing harm to the children . 
95762:7	###There was a lot of erm protests after a World in Act was it a World in Action on tea estates in India and Sri Lanka ? ###And er that was quite a few years ago , about the conditions and on tea estates , and er er that was partly why we switched mostly to Kenyan tea I think after that . 
95818:9	###That is something to do with Traidcraft that they erm they quite often work with groups who have been set up by carriages from Europe . ###So they 've actually got to be making something that 's that can be sold or can be sold in the near future if they . 
95838:88	###Oh . ###Erm whether there 's fair wages are paid as part of the and the conditions of employment , including the right to organize . 
95952:73	###M More likely . ###Yeah . 
95969:11	###Yes , and I think the prices should be in par . ###You know so that they do n't make other produce cheaper so that . 
95974:15	###Yes , but they do n't put their price . ###If they have Traidcraft , they do n't have something which is cheaper beside it . 
96006:15	###Ask supermarkets to stock fair-traded products . ###Of course if there 's some section on coffee , how are you going to get them to look at Traidcraft ? 
96018:13	###And sometimes they said , I do n't know . ###And , well you can keep them . 
96020:13	###In France they have to say ###They ca n't tell me where it comes , pardon ? 
96021:17	###They ca n't tell me where it comes , pardon ? ###in France they have to say where they 've come from . 
96051:13	###Yes . ###Coffee and cocoa . 
96068:27	###Share them with people . ###Would you like to start ? 
96069:58	###Would you like to start ? ###Erm well we decided that we would have to erm try and live more simply erm that was the only way that er erm this would work . 
96070:17	###Erm well we decided that we would have to erm try and live more simply erm that was the only way that er erm this would work . ###I if the producing countries are going to get more for their products , we 're going to have to take less . 
96071:15	###I if the producing countries are going to get more for their products , we 're going to have to take less . ###We 're going to have to eat less . 
96155:7	###No but the poor ca n't go to Tesco stores . ###Yes , exactly , Tescos is not cheap 
96164:36	###It is , yeah . ###But you see , neither are corner shop , I mean , we 've got a lovely corner shop at the roundabout but the prices packing small cos they 're for the elderly and single people and that , and the prices just rocket you know so high . 
96210:57	###I mean ###Because we 're definitely paying less , I 'm paying thirty five P less for a packet of instant than I was even eighteen months ago . 
96276:33	###Mhm . ###because they , they 've shown they are susceptible to , to encouragement . 
96283:13	###and , and they 'll ditch it . ###Is there any point taking it to a local Sainsburys ? 
96326:9	###Mhm . ###Or it goes into the very cheap coffees here and erm and no er what do you call it , Kwik Save sell some coffee and chicory mixture , which is forty four pence for a jar . 
96330:50	###H have we got a any other business then ? ###Yes . 
96443:13	###The other thing I 'm going to talk about are intervals . ###I ca n't remember whether in grade it was three you did was n't it ? 
96447:9	###So you know things like major second , major thirds . ###Erm perfect fourths and perfect fifths ? 
96548:14	###So . ###Yes it 's C C . 
96551:4	###Because it ###Oh right . 
96589:16	###It 'll be , it 'll be played as an E but of course it 's actually actually an F flat . ###Okay ? 
96614:9	###Second ###will be ? 
96643:21	###So again you would n't know you were n't playing an octave . ###But on paper you can see that you 're intending it as a an augmented interval . 
96694:29	###What about a diminished fifth ? ###Diminished fifth would be a C flat , a B . 
96720:12	###That 's erm D flat . ###A D flat . 
96725:24	###intervals wo n't they ? ###And then you 've got to add or take away . 
96729:27	###It would put it up a semitone , so it would be a normal B . ###A normal B . 
96774:15	###Most of the Italian ones I do n't have any trouble with . ###But I can not remember the German ones . 
96780:15	###I do French and German . ###You 'll probably find you wo n't have quite as much trouble as I do with them . 
97058:26	###Er where you 've got a note that obviously goes over a beat as in that one there ###Yeah . 
97080:10	###As in that one , you 've go you 've got to alter what they actually put there . ###Not going to alter the sound of it . 
97188:23	###here . ###And anything that you find you do n't know then we can perhaps go back on just the bits that you do n't know . 
97264:27	###Because they position middle C . ###Middle C 's actually positioned between those bits there so the middle line there becomes middle C . 
97298:15	###And perhaps one down there but not very likely . ###So it 's just to make it much more comfortable to look at . 
97390:7	###Mm . ###of things anyway . 
97392:19	###You have to know an awful lot you know for grade five . ###You , you 've gotta have quite a wide knowledge . 
97448:68	###This has a lovely , but er I think I 'm going to put it in the back because my er arrangement is rather heavy , and I do n't want it to fall over . ###We had er er quite a few catastrophes today with the flowers . 
97530:10	###Try saying that after a few gins . ###And some which gives a effect . 
97686:20	###Now this is for the dog daisies that you get in er hedgerows . ###I have n't said that have I yet ? 
97734:22	###It 's for the preservation society . ###And the last one going in . 
97780:11	###my daughter 's looking for a actually . ###So . 
97821:32	###That 's another one gone mum and that 's another one gone . ###They were in the garden shed . 
97875:143	###Did , did you know that we have one there now ? ###Quite industrious . 
97917:15	###Good show mm . ###It is , yes . 
97930:77	###Erm I 'll tell you about the er while I 'm doing some . ###Erm we call it the cherry chucker . 
97946:9	###And the You know the white And that 's just nice just now is n't it ? ###And of course we 've got this I have a little dog and she loves to roll in this . 
98053:10	###No doubt we were the next day . ###Now there we have our 
98069:10	###Well it 's , it looks like it 's been cooking . ###I 'll scrape it . 
98085:39	###Well we thought , well you know , we c we can do a bit . ###I 'm just thinking I 've got these on the wrong horizontal scale . 
98094:34	###And of course they closed all the night classes , did n't they ? ###Erm I think that one will . 
98230:10	###Now I 've got some roses to put in somewhere have n't I ? ###Yeah . 
98234:37	###So we have a round shape of a kaleidoscope . ###Hopefully it behaves itself . 
98264:10	###But they had all sorts of virtually now do n't they ? ###That 's why I did n't want to go to the edge because I wanted to try and do my own . 
98264:37	###But they had all sorts of virtually now do n't they ? ###That 's why I did n't want to go to the edge because I wanted to try and do my own . 
98388:37	###Mm . ###areas . 
98396:22	###And you know normally with the handedness , you do n't use your left hand unless you break your right wrist or something . ###Mm . 
98408:39	###Mm . ###are possible . 
98408:76	###Mm . ###are possible . 
98553:73	###Mm . ###you know a particular conclusion . 
98557:9	###Now for er sensing people it 's probably the other way round . ###Mm . 
98902:39	###I mean it may , may fit your values and it may have lots of possibilities but what are actually gonna be doing and will you actually be capable of it or , or enjoy it or whatever . ###So you need all four an and it 's not a criticism to start with the N and the F . 
98984:68	###and what are your this and what are your that . ###An and really even the N F recruiters will er want some of that . 
99029:14	###Not really no . ###No it is n't . 
99035:43	###You know you , you , you need to be doing some of that . ###It , it 's just a question of I suppose whether you do it or you get other people to do it or or what . 
99035:63	###You know you , you , you need to be doing some of that . ###It , it 's just a question of I suppose whether you do it or you get other people to do it or or what . 
99084:55	###And I discovered that ###And it did n't work out . 
99093:23	###Yes . ###You know I do n't think you can get by without them really . 
99103:25	###But having said that I ca n't see a job where you can just kind of swan in and you know and think about a million different things in one day or whatever . ###So you know I mean I su I suppose a lo the questionnaire seemed to concentrate very much on how you were outside work . 
99109:15	###And the teachers commented on it . ###They said that I was too much of myself . 
99116:63	###I mean it 's acting , teaching more or less . ###Yeah . 
99118:32	###And you know and you , you , you got to have , gotta get , you know , you have to get cross with them if they misbehave or whatever because otherwise there is n't any order in the place . ###Mm . 
99221:10	###Four weeks . ###Yeah . 
99594:44	###Is it ? ###Mm . 
99662:14	###Mhm . ###I want you back in four weeks . 
99673:13	###See , I 'm used to doing everything myself . ###Mhm . 
99729:57	###And just do that . ###About twenty times a day . 
99866:23	###Yeah . ###Coming down my back maybe , and 
99978:7	###Three and a half already ? ###Aye . 
100049:8	###Och aye . ###Och aye . 
100082:22	###Oh , I 'm not going back , I 'm not going back there . ###After that she was awfully upset . 
100102:14	###And what they did was they put a tube from here into the next bit of the stomach , that comes round from underneath there , put a tube across there ###Ah , right . 
100157:15	###And down you come . ###Ah , doing alright . 
100371:12	###It does n't like to come out . ###So I see . 
100786:114	###I usually mention briefly on going into business on your own account , working for yourself , but I 'll develop that later that that 's one of the things I can dr drop out altogether if w depending on the type of group I 'm with . ###So okay , well we 'll make a start and then we 've got but my first remarks were a little bit , bit so there we are . 
100789:9	###The short answer was that when I was working as inspector of taxes I used to give these talks , I was required to give talks . ###And the revenue got mean and decided it could n't afford the time of serving officers and it left pre- retirement council and other bodies with a gap to fill er the only other people who are er professional if you like , who could fill it , would be accountants and they were n't available . 
100801:14	###Okay . ###So that 's the background of why I 'm giving this as long retired er tax inspector the mean , my own department has got a bit mean . 
100819:26	###We 're still , we 're still going , I , I have n't met it yet but ###Saga too does excellent investment , income tax and insurance articles from time to time . 
100839:28	###but er nevertheless ###Mm . 
100850:15	###So please do n't be put off by the title , it says Help the Aged , I ai n't going in there ! ###Just have a browse and have a look in and see what 's . 
100850:63	###So please do n't be put off by the title , it says Help the Aged , I ai n't going in there ! ###Just have a browse and have a look in and see what 's . 
100856:69	###These are , they really are good . ###The er you 'll be interested I think , those of you who 've not met the er independent taxation changes that have come about , there 's a great booklet a great series of books on er independent taxation about people who are considering working for themselves there 's some booklets . 
100878:152	###The previous year was ninety two ninety three , the year that 's just gone . ###The previous year to that , ninety one ninety two , there was a change in the income tax regulations , affecting married women , only married women , everybody is the same , stayed the same . 
100890:23	###Or between wife and husband , we tend to think only of transfer from husbands to wife , but er we do meet quite er a w er ladies who 've got quite high earnings and they themselves are paying forty percent in which case they should make sure that any investment income of theirs is transferred to the husband , so as to get the , to either use up allowances that are not being used at all because of absence of the income , or to benefit from these different rates of tax . ###They might run off and take it with them . 
100898:8	###If you 've got a joint account look to see whether closure and transfer of the asset into the wife 's name will give you a better result . ###It 's no good saying to the revenue well half of it er my wife has half of this account therefore I 'm not regarding it as mine . 
100898:42	###If you 've got a joint account look to see whether closure and transfer of the asset into the wife 's name will give you a better result . ###It 's no good saying to the revenue well half of it er my wife has half of this account therefore I 'm not regarding it as mine . 
100900:9	###It has to be an account in the wife 's name , it has to be a genuine transfer to a wife so that there 's no doubt about it but it is a on her account . ###But you can see that er for someone who has no , a wife who has no income and her husband 's paying twenty five percent or forty percent then by moving a , say er twenty thousand at erm well er whatever percentage to fill up these allowances er if you 're getting ten thousand or twenty thousand put , put it into the wife 's name that they give us the interest is then hers , if she has no other income it neatly can be swallowed up by the allowance . 
100973:177	###It effectively charges it because if you 've got six thousand allowances and you withdraw that amount putting it against the total income it means that you 're actually paying tax on those by deduction . ###But that 's how the revenue works out how t t to collect income where it ca n't operate a separate pay as you earn coding system , it withdraws some of the allowances and effectively charges tax . 
100992:61	###So that at the end of the five years , assuming you 've paid the maximum stake at seven and a half percent , you would , otherwise you would receive the nine thousand back of course , and at that rate you would receive two six seven one and that will include , if you 're a twenty five percent payer , six hundred and sixty seven that you would have otherwise lost in , that would have gone out in tax . ###Or if you 're forty percent you would have actually paid a thousand and sixty seven , but because you did n't pay that because it 's tax exempt you actually gained that amount of interest on the tax that stayed in with your account . 
101023:5	###You can say well I want to do , put my money so and so , what 's the best rate for me ? ###Or er er understand I 'm not entirely certain about that , they do the same with , they will tell you which are the , which are paying the best TESSA rates . 
101060:48	###I think as long as you 've got some way of dealing with things you can live with them . ###Cos you 're , it 's positive again , you 're in charge and not it . 
101063:7	###Y the power comes from muscle contraction , it 's needed for movement , management , balance and agility and for lifting and handling objects . ###It needs regular graded notice , progressive practice to build and maintain the skill . 
101065:8	###Care must be taken to start from each individual 's capability . ###Because your friend can do some fantastic things it does n't mean to say your muscles will , you could be in trouble . 
101118:55	###Because you know they came up , they were full of the joys of spring , looking around , chatting to their friends and then they r started looking at the stepping stone . ###And you knew what they were thinking , they were trying to weigh up whether they dare go across the stepping stones and you could tell by their faces and what they did of course when they decided no it was beyond them and they 'd play safe and they 'd go back the same way . 
101147:45	###Th the one that was so bad , where a man used his back for other people to escape by ? ###Now people th people there , those people would have been in dire trouble if there had n't been somebody who could do that . 
101148:7	###Now people th people there , those people would have been in dire trouble if there had n't been somebody who could do that . ###Now I always think of that as stamina cos I think that must have been a terrific stamina thing . 
101148:30	###Now people th people there , those people would have been in dire trouble if there had n't been somebody who could do that . ###Now I always think of that as stamina cos I think that must have been a terrific stamina thing . 
101164:76	###You should , you , you 're advised not to jog on tarmac because the surface is hard and jars and so if you do a lot of it can you see and if , particularly if your joints are not equal to it , then you set up a lot of trouble . ###Erm it , again if you 'd only do things like jogging it will build up , if you 've got the right conditions , your heart y y your heart and lung ability , but in order to have this stamina that we 're talking about you 've got to have power . 
101180:23	###Erm and again when I ###you need also , very much , to have the all round development , the ability to be nimble , speedy and capable of dealing with the unexpected , and a series of movements demanding and challenging on weight transference and balance performed with speed and various use of space . 
101261:197	###But I think another important thing is to weigh up yourself , it stems from you , what are you like ? ###You see lots of people find that they w they do best when they join a class and they go to the class , it 's there every week and th or maybe more than once a week and that keeps them going because they are , they 're expected , it 's a definite booking , and that 's it and they can go that way . 
101267:7	###There were various factors that came into making this decision but one of the things is I 'm heartily sick that I have never been able to go away on holiday in the autumn ever in my life . ###Cos I was in teaching so if you know where you were in the autumn , I leave Clarendon College and what do I do ? 
101273:238	###Which is a bit different and I 'd like to see it , that 's just one of my things , but again when you 're in , going into retirement I think you 've got to think about this , I mean I went , nobody twisted my arm , I went into that situation and I 've enjoyed it for a great many years , but now I 'm thinking I 'd , before I , it 's too late I want to have a , a l a fling in autumn as it were . ###So I 'm going to have a , a go at that . 
101284:14	###Er and I might say you 're not the only one I 've got my eye on . ###on somebody else but er no comment . 
101310:31	###Will it be up hills . ###You know and immediately can you see , you 've asked him all these questions you can see what a pain in the neck you are to all the people you 've asked these questions of . 
101315:134	###You can get up and down . ###Who w somebody said you find another way , somebody said that ear earlier on in the talk . 
101321:32	###And again you see people fa you 've got to keep your arms strong , how do you get in and out of the bath at the moment ? ###Do n't suppose you 've even bothered to think about it . 
101337:17	###And then I know a lot people who now in retirement do not have a bath , because they ca n't be confident enough at getting out of a bath , so they say oh well I manage with a shower . ###Now you can manage with a shower , I mean it 's , it 's efficient as regards er keeping you er clean , but can you , to men there 's a different pleasure in having a shower , I enjoy both I would hate to h to be limited to one . 
101342:21	###Pardon ? ###Often with something light not heavy . 
101371:52	###Erm right , well we 've got the lights down , we 'll perhaps er use some of the slides er later , but er if I can just introduce myself by saying that some of you will already know Chris , this is the er nature of our business . ###Er we are involved er quite heavily in local authority and teachers generally , through unions and through other connections , so erm some of you will have seen us advertised anyway . 
101404:26	###a boxing promoter who reckons you should only wear them for er n evenings , obviously . ###So er that s er that firm collapsed and people lost money and er that 's why FIMBRA is there , er to try and protect the investor . 
101407:11	###Because if you want to , if you want to beat the system , you can of course . ###Erm but that sort of thing can always go on so er I mean as far as you 're concerned , are a major broker , are er obviously , obviously a , a reasonable choice in that we are accountable . 
101408:22	###Erm but that sort of thing can always go on so er I mean as far as you 're concerned , are a major broker , are er obviously , obviously a , a reasonable choice in that we are accountable . ###Any major broker must be in the U K because er er they are exposed to the public view if you like , and if there are any errors or , or deceptions then they 're likely to come up very quickly . 
101442:15	###So I mean think about it as long term planning , and certainly for those under er sixty the long term becomes extremely long term because er you know you 're looking at perhaps a third of your life er which is er still to be accounted for . ###Er so these er are er the state pension arrangements , and you 've had a speaker on state pensions anyway . 
101448:114	###So a lot of the target planning I suppose that we 've come across is people saying well when I retire , I shall actually go down to half salary at best , that 's assuming th that you 've actually made half , about half salary on your pension being forty eightieths or whatever . ###You 've still got a fair gap to make up between that and your salary . 
101500:97	###So immediately they 've made two hundred and fifty pounds a year er bonus by having the wife 's er name on the account . ###Now , the way that er gross accounts work is erm er fairly straightforward . 
101511:71	###If that was paying some important bills they 'd be struggling . ###And er I can remember several cases years ag you know so going back two or three years where people were debating with me why did n't I put more into National Savings ? 
101540:9	###So erm have a problem trying to get it back . ###That 's right , yeah so I eventually managed it , but it took some negotiating . 
101547:23	###Yes , but can that just be the income , or has it to be the whole capital ? ###Er , no the whole , the whole capital should be held by you , and paid to you or your or i in , in a case of a joint er couple because er once it 's paid out , it would become the tax it would become the t the taxable interest of whoever received it . 
101636:76	###Now , the , the interest , that three four four five ###Mhm . 
101636:109	###Now , the , the interest , that three four four five ###Mhm . 
101641:26	###If it 's i I mean ###Yes . 
101647:56	###Yes , this is where I 'm confused , if you want to take up ###Can I just a minute , because I 've got the same feeling . 
101656:12	###Yeah . ###Yeah , tha that 's if you want to use the income of course . 
101663:39	###It was the question of making sure that we did n't pay tax on any of that three four four five . ###Well , 
101739:36	###Inheritance tax is not your problem , it 's your children 's problem . ###So er I mean you can actually say to your children , well okay you know if I , we die tomorrow in a road accident , there 'd be a liability to tax , erm and say the estate 's worth two hundred thousand , then fifty thousand would be liable to tax at forty pence in the pound , so there 'd be twenty thousand pound debt to pay to the revenue . 
101740:53	###So er I mean you can actually say to your children , well okay you know if I , we die tomorrow in a road accident , there 'd be a liability to tax , erm and say the estate 's worth two hundred thousand , then fifty thousand would be liable to tax at forty pence in the pound , so there 'd be twenty thousand pound debt to pay to the revenue . ###Now that twenty thousand pounds can be paid er it has to be paid before probate is granted . 
101740:77	###So er I mean you can actually say to your children , well okay you know if I , we die tomorrow in a road accident , there 'd be a liability to tax , erm and say the estate 's worth two hundred thousand , then fifty thousand would be liable to tax at forty pence in the pound , so there 'd be twenty thousand pound debt to pay to the revenue . ###Now that twenty thousand pounds can be paid er it has to be paid before probate is granted . 
101809:90	###Terminal . ###Right . 
101848:35	###Or if you 've got a solicitor who is handling your legal affairs , then perhaps they do it er for nothing or cheaply . ###I mean y I think the charges that banks are making in order to make up some of their losses , they 're going to be passed on to the average investor , you know the average client , so erm you know the Halifax will do it free , I 've heard recently that they are actually charging for er holding your deeds . 
101874:182	###liability , but if you 're getting beyond that , you 've got to think well is it worth me spending money to actually erm er get the mortgage fixed ? ###Erm it I think it is , because I think we 're in a , we 're in a dip , if I can just go off the the , the idea of conventional investments at the moment . 
101874:259	###liability , but if you 're getting beyond that , you 've got to think well is it worth me spending money to actually erm er get the mortgage fixed ? ###Erm it I think it is , because I think we 're in a , we 're in a dip , if I can just go off the the , the idea of conventional investments at the moment . 
101878:17	###And it is at the moment because nobody 's buying any goods . ###But the minute we all start buying goods again , it 's ith an endowment.I think that the compan companies out there have not made any profits for about five years , and they 're desperate to return to er an even keel , and they are going to force up the price of goods and services as soon humanly possible , and we 'll pick up the bill . 
101974:33	###Yeah . ###get to make some more . 
101987:39	###You can if it 's a , if it 's a private pension , yes you can do . ###But you ca n't . 
102089:85	###Yes . ###I did n't know this one . 
102101:22	###And at the end of the ten years of course that 's all tax-free cash . ###The annuity is actually quite a attractive because there 's not much tax er liability on an annuity anyway , only a very small proportion and for her in this situation she could actually make a single contribution of say eight thousand pound , the maturity from the endowment , and actually buy this sort of contract straight off . 
102103:12	###In which case she does n't have to worry about funding from income , which is what your question was was n't it ? ###Yeah . 
102124:20	###And I mean recently I came across somebody who 'd got some part holdings in diamonds , and of course the diamond market 's gone into rapid decline because of the er is it Namibian diamonds , and , and the Russians er breaking up the De Beer market . ###And you can , you can have that thing looking very very difficult , very , in very short time . 
102124:50	###And I mean recently I came across somebody who 'd got some part holdings in diamonds , and of course the diamond market 's gone into rapid decline because of the er is it Namibian diamonds , and , and the Russians er breaking up the De Beer market . ###And you can , you can have that thing looking very very difficult , very , in very short time . 
102125:46	###And you can , you can have that thing looking very very difficult , very , in very short time . ###So I mean she 'd have to be a very speculative investor , she 'd have to be right up to er adventurous , for her to think about that . 
102183:94	###About , you know , the horrible charges , and they were horribly badly charged , I mean , Lloyds Bank you reckon they could activate ten and a half percent in its first year to actually break even you know , because of the initial charges setting up fees , etcetera . ###Now that 's pretty heavy going . 
102256:18	###Yes . ###er which may or may not be there because we do n't know how much her income is . 
102286:27	###So National Savings , that 's not a bad decision , cos I mean National Savings are absolutely secure , and the other thing is that you do n't need to put twenty five thousand pounds in to get the highest rate , you 'll get the highest rate from two thousand pounds upwards , so it 's very good for small amounts . ###So it 's excellent here , but we know that it 's at a variable , and I think the problem that you were probably facing is how do you secure a a better rate than that . 
102359:10	###P E P exceed the limits ? ###Er , yes it would . 
102377:93	###Seven percent plus . ###Which would give him seven thousand a year , rather than five . 
102384:40	###Erm some of the banks actually lay off the charges to some extent , but I think he might find that a bit expensive to run , erm and of course they 'll take their charges even if they do n't make a profit for you . ###As often as not . 
102454:58	###And I thought oh , well that 's interesting . ###So it was Miss . 
102471:50	###And er it 's a matter of getting the right mix . ###So I , I would n't be entirely suspicious of an of annuities , but at the moment the er the erm temporary rates are n't too good . 
102522:13	###And they 'll quote to me that inflation 's at two percent . ###Okay , well you 've got two percent plus three and a quarter , that makes five and a quarter . 
102751:29	###Er just make it available , if somebody asks for it , they 'll go and drag somebody up to have a look at you , and they will keep er er they 've made it so they keep an independent arm , but it 's not the major part of their business . ###They are interested in volume , obviously , and that 's what y that 's what they 're going to go for through their products . 
102787:21	###So erm er ongoing charges there are n't any . ###We do n't l levy any charges for mon er monitoring portfolios . 
102882:44	###Or a garage as a workshop or a , a workshop as a workshop . ###And you can claim that proportion of your total outgoing . 
102889:31	###It 's bound to be small , if it 's a small part of your house . ###And in all , in most of those cases it will be covered by the individual exemption of five thousand eight hundred per annum anyway . 
102891:14	###There 's no real I mean you 'd have to be in a real big way of a business and use a large proportion of your house for the gain on that proportion to exceed five thousand eight hundred . ###So in most cases , you can ignore it . 
102966:24	###Cos this is where the revenue gets its information about all sorts of tax . ###I mean if you 're a builder and you receive sixteen thousand , of , of that there 's a thousand pounds from Joe Bloggs builder whatnot , then the er the tax inspector will make a note , and pass on a little note to Joe Bloggs ' file that , yeah he paid Bill Smith a thousand pounds , and i that then should appear in his accounts , and if it does n't , then he 's a ripe subject for being investigated . 
102966:31	###Cos this is where the revenue gets its information about all sorts of tax . ###I mean if you 're a builder and you receive sixteen thousand , of , of that there 's a thousand pounds from Joe Bloggs builder whatnot , then the er the tax inspector will make a note , and pass on a little note to Joe Bloggs ' file that , yeah he paid Bill Smith a thousand pounds , and i that then should appear in his accounts , and if it does n't , then he 's a ripe subject for being investigated . 
102993:15	###You raised it , did n't you , Bob ? ###Yes . 
102994:63	###Yes . ###And I , I must admit , it left me somewhat confused . 
102996:12	###And can I b make it quite clear , that if you transfer assets into your wife 's name , it has to be a pucker transfer into her name . ###You ca n't retain control of it at all . 
103016:7	###Yeah , authority to sign . ###She just gives you authority to sign . 
103017:7	###She just gives you authority to sign . ###It has to be a genuine transfer of an asset . 
103074:15	###Also we seem to be awfully short of knives . ###We are . 
103104:58	###Right . ###Now this is set up differently cos this is set up very sensibly , so that you can fill in who wrote it , when , what date and what it 's about , and when you try and find it later it 's easier to find instead of scrapping through lots of files that do n't have a long document . 
103217:7	###I just did . ###Oh do you want me to hold 
103405:10	###Yes . ###So that 's just got out of WordPerfect . 
103649:7	###And again . ###Ah okay . 
103656:10	###Right . ###Now 
103711:11	###and that one is shift . ###Yeah . 
103842:7	###Yes . ###You said no . 
103942:9	###So R for retrieve . ###Oh I know because there 's more to , there 's files in it . 
104260:17	###Well is n't that weird ? ###It has n't got any suggestion for keyboard . 
104273:9	###And again . ###and then put A . 
104381:9	###The default , the thing it 'll do if you do n't select something is no . ###Mm . 
104718:150	###I think that 's the right ###Born at hundred and twenty two Willenhall . 
104727:85	###er , so er no that was n't no ###Started at 
104732:9	###I got this job in the machine sh in one of the lock shops and er for a fellow , I worked for him and er after I 'd been working for him they wanted me to work for somebody else but this fellow would n't let me go . ###He says he 's , he 's my bloke , he 's gonna stick with me . 
104745:9	###He says , well then , he says you could or you could n't you have n't served a week 's notice . ###It 's one or the another . 
104756:70	###They put complete trust in me you understand what I mean ? ###Well , whatever they was doing , they 'd drop and do whatever I said it , and it was the same with the bobbin shop , you know . 
104758:7	###Mind you these was instructions from the office to me , telling me what I , what they wanted and I had to carry it out . ###It 's rather surprising to you , but they used to sell them in Woolworths for sixpence . 
104791:89	###He says it 's come to my knowledge cos er they want this and that and the other . ###So he says you ought to go down there , you can mention my name . 
104803:145	###that 's fine , do n't worry ###and er 
104805:97	###and er in the piece of property at the back of the pub , down the opposite side of the road , down a lane you went on to and there was a football field , couple of football fields there and prior to this , they 'd have to if they could use this little place as a stripping room and he said yes . ###Well when he said I could come it was er September . 
104816:32	###And he was bringing orders right , left and centre off of his clients . ###England , Ireland , Scotland and Wales Michael , no doubt about it . 
104817:84	###England , Ireland , Scotland and Wales Michael , no doubt about it . ###And in no time at all , I did n't have to ask for jobs , I 'd got more than I could do , you know and er I was still , very well taken care of in the shop . 
104822:88	###Two friends of mine and they says er c can we find you a place in our that 's right love . ###Er Arthur and er played for Walsall football club , Arthur but er they , little shop there . 
104826:8	###Poor Mr died and ###Mr 
104836:46	###But er ###The ship that the Queen sailed on and Princess Elizabeth 
104838:42	###I 'll tell you about that in a minute and then er I er had to go about forty times for permission . ###That side of this ro industrial , this side is residential and that 's strict , you know what I mean . 
104841:49	###Cos there 's er due to retire d in , in nineteen forty-two , nineteen eighty-two , a three year licence to own that premise there . ###You know , this is how it was first and I only come across that but , how it went , they felt I was genuine I suppose and they could trust me and they left it as it was and I had me own building . 
104854:88	###When they was doing the decorating and that and a lock went wrong oh take it down to Dick and er they 'd bring it and whatever I was doing , however important it was , just because they 'd be finish the decorating at night and they wanted to put the lock back , I 'd drop what I was doing and do this for them . ###And I was gonna tell you this . 
104865:71	###And er , that 's right and they told me what they wanted and er that 's right , there was a hundred and fifty-five locks . ###Five different kinds for different parts of the ship . 
104868:9	###Yet , there was five separate master keys to each suite . ###This is applied because of the wards , you understand what I mean . 
104872:19	###George the fifth ###Her father . 
104885:9	###And they sent a big from down there ###Oh ah 
104895:282	###And he says well , I can wait till tomorrow , better than going back and coming again . ###So er I went down the Red Lion in Willenhall and fixed him up for a night 's dosh , did n't I , and the driver and then er I worked on , worked on and on and was able to get these er done for him to take back to fit this ship . 
104900:129	###I said certainly . ###Well , they 'd got the skeleton that wanted a big brass lock but er oh you know , lovely and er it was more trouble getting the thing through the pan to get er the case than putting the insides in it , if you follow what I mean . 
104929:85	###Oh yes ###Lord 's , yes 
104998:24	###You always had a I had a dinner-time , half-past twelve to half-past one , every day and er you was allowed to have a cup of tea . ###As a matter of fact , a lot of the firms provided the cup of teas , you could go and get one , you know what I mean . 
105000:77	###I think at that time you had to pay for it , but you could go and have ten minutes , sommat like that , and a cup of tea . ###It were n't er just all you know , there was a certain amount of er thought attached to it and as I say , the people was er accepted by the gaffers and er respected , you know what I mean . 
105018:75	###What , why why do you think they , why do you think they 've gone , so many of them ? ###Why do you think they 've disappeared ? 
105039:66	###And er ###Oh yes , it was very old-fashioned 
105083:68	###There was a Post Office on the corner opposite the Post Office chapel , Post er opposite the Baptist chapel and er up the back yard there , there was this premise , it was behind a pub called the Beehive and erm I rented it out there and er that was nextdoor to and the castings was a shilling a pound and er ###They 'd do , they 'd do special one-off things for your would they ? 
105101:19	###Cos they used to have gates with er two or three inches apart , you know and I 'd gotta have a projection . ###Well , I could go to the casting and asked him to put the pattern in and fire it for it , to cut the sand out like that , you know so that the metal 'd run in like that and you 'd got the big head as you wanted , you know and er it 'd take you like castings with the machine and all that sort of thing , it was all hand stuff you know and yeah 
105103:15	###They 'd they 'd have to be filed before you used them , would they ? ###Oh I could go , used to get them on the emery wheel and er square them up with a pair of sliding gages . 
105117:43	###You could call ingenuity if you like and er but it 've , did apply my lad and er once you 'd got one , you could have er one cast and dress it up and you 'd got another one , you know what I mean . ###You make a thing as is gonna do the job and it 's no problem then to get castings off it and all that sort of thing . 
105142:45	###So you 'd , they , they they gave , they sent you the blanks , did they , and you 'd work them up ? ###Be a different master key for the next ward and all that sort of thing . 
105144:10	###There was fifty and there was five levers and three lifts and I had to get a piece of paper and er make a , when you get one , two , three and then five you could have er three , three , two , one and five , four , three , two , one , you know what I mean ? ###Then I could have two , a one , three and four three , two , one , five , do you know what I mean ? 
105147:50	###There was no Michael , it 's just only way , co mind you could only do these on one-sided because when you turn your key the other side , it 's gotta be th exactly the same to do the job . ###But this was because it was one-sided , they used to lock it from the outside and there was a catch on the inside as they could put in . 
105148:29	###But this was because it was one-sided , they used to lock it from the outside and there was a catch on the inside as they could put in . ###They only used to ever lock the door from the outside and er I er had to make er fifty and as I say , number them one up to fifty and er then they 'd perhaps on a odd occasion they sent me an order for one , the number the number 
105155:220	###Oh yes , I 've al I was always in the union . ###As a matter of fact er yes I , I , I joined at sixteen on the union , when I was a , a kid and er I 've always believed in it and I encourage others to do the same . 
105156:197	###As a matter of fact er yes I , I , I joined at sixteen on the union , when I was a , a kid and er I 've always believed in it and I encourage others to do the same . ###And when I er went to go on me own er I still wanted to keep in the union and I went down the Locksmiths ' union , which was in the market place , and they said they er we could n't , we could n't have you in the union if you go on your own erm there 's another denomination or something , was something that you 'd have to join or something like that and be on your own . 
105166:15	###Were , were there any times when the union was , when the union was quite important ? ###When , when they helped to solve a problem at , at Can you remember any instance ? 
105170:8	###Changing from making locks . ###Changing from being employed to being self-employed , it 's , it 's a big change that is you and er , and er the union the union helped me and er told me what I could do and what I could n't do and all that sort of thing . 
105288:7	###Would you say erm at one time there were many more firms ? ###Oh , years ago , when I was a boy , there were twelve tanneries in Walsall . 
105322:9	###Er , it would n't matter to the leather trade as such or to any of the countries , er if there was no saddling and harness trade , and that goes for countries like erm , Britain and France and Germany and United States and so on . ###Obviously , of course , it matters in the sense that people who want to ride horses and race horses and hunt with horses and this sort of thing , so that as a pleasure thing , er it 's good er to have the leather for those purposes . 
105352:53	###And the funny thing was , it broke every window in the house except the ones nearest to it . ###And those remain just the same as they were before . 
105368:102	###I do n't know how much they gave , but I do know that it , it , it came into a , a few hundred pounds which is a lot of money in those days you know , when you 're talking about nineteen sixteen . ###But I ca n't remember what it was because obviously , at that age , you do n't bother about money do you like , you know . 
105370:43	###But erm as I say , they did er , the people did but you never got nothing off the government for it and er , I 've always said it , he must have been a much better man than I thought he was because er , er , to go as I say from what it was in those days to start his own business and that . ###And that he had that house built , er , like er , before he got in it and it was paid , built and paid for like , you know and that . 
105372:81	###I think , when I think it since , I think he must have been a remarkable man to work and slave like that . ###He was always at work , always Sunday . 
105374:8	###Now , cos I mean do n't forget originally we used to take milk out twice a day , morning and night , because you had to fetch it from the farm . ###They got no coolers or anything like that , fridges , and nothing of that you know , and er , you 'd got a , we used to fetch it in the morning and we used to supply Massey 's Lavender 's in and two other , two or three other little places . 
105374:32	###Now , cos I mean do n't forget originally we used to take milk out twice a day , morning and night , because you had to fetch it from the farm . ###They got no coolers or anything like that , fridges , and nothing of that you know , and er , you 'd got a , we used to fetch it in the morning and we used to supply Massey 's Lavender 's in and two other , two or three other little places . 
105377:192	###And I , I had a little truck and run it down from down into . ###And er , were at Lavender 's right . 
105380:47	###Well , of course , there was , they got no methods of keeping it you see . ###You were , you were at school presumably , erm at the time of the Zeppelin raid . 
105404:63	###I ye you know being working with me dad on the milk round you did n't have chance to go anywhere an and that 's perfectly true . ###I never had a holiday for about ten years . 
105444:43	###We always keep the home fires burning and them sort of things like , you know . ###The lads used to sing them like when er , but as I say , it was n't anybody only just the kids round as we played about with you know . 
105444:54	###We always keep the home fires burning and them sort of things like , you know . ###The lads used to sing them like when er , but as I say , it was n't anybody only just the kids round as we played about with you know . 
105448:7	###Well I , we did n't because me nor me brother and that . ###I 'm afraid I was a bit tougher than me brother . 
105456:126	###I , I 'll put that first see , because I , I was always fit . ###I never know what it was to , not do anything , go , go to the doctor 's and be bad or anything like that . 
105462:127	###Pretending to be soldiers or anything ? ###No , I never saw lads er , er , the game that seemed most popular with us , I do n't know whether you have , it 's nothing only really hopping across the road . 
105524:35	###Well I went and worked in a factory for about nine months I suppose , and the man himself , cos it was casting , brass castings , the man himself says , he says look son , this job 's no good to you I 'll tell you that . ###An it do n't matter who we 've set on we 'll stop him . 
105525:7	###An it do n't matter who we 've set on we 'll stop him . ###Cos , you used to work for the castronery had to pay you see , not the firm . 
105526:7	###Cos , you used to work for the castronery had to pay you see , not the firm . ###You had to , we worked for the castronery at the back . 
105531:138	###You , well you , these and things see , they , they was all sort of er furniture particularly they used to make a lot of . ###And er , that was in very big demand in those days and of course us being the whatsernames , they , we used to have these things . 
105534:25	###Not because I was made to be late , but I , I , I , I 'd , me mother had made me cos she said you gotta come home to your dinner and there was no buses there were trams in them days , but I 'd got to get into the town . ###I could , I used to run it down and er , and that 's the only reason me mother would let me , but they was pleased as punch when I stopped and went and worked for me dad again . 
105549:9	###So it was quite er , a bit to do like , you know . ###But he did n't do quite as much as me I do n't think like . 
105550:47	###But he did n't do quite as much as me I do n't think like . ###Did you have to fetch the milk fresh each morning ? 
105556:146	###Those over , still over the bridge like now , you know and er , where the brook comes through , but of course there was no , er , there was no houses at the back end you see , it went right ###few changes round here then ? 
105577:29	###What was like in those days ? ###er , it , it , it 's er , it more or less finished , er when you went over the bridge like . 
105633:59	###They ne they did n't , nobody used to , well as far I knew , nobody ever caused trouble in the kids in , like in , on those sort of things . ###I could do me own wack of er , playing about like , you know . 
105686:70	###Do you remember the trams going down ? ###Oh yes I wa as kids er , I used to , I could always get in with the , the conductresses . 
105785:9	###Erm the working conditions were n't very good and the behaviour of the officers was n't very tolerable . ###Because I had come straight from college , it was really difficult for me to tolerate that sort of behaviour , so I managed to er convince the workers to form a union . 
105787:22	###So I had to they said oh you were the shop steward . ###So I was shop steward for there , for one year and a half and er eventually because of the row between the workers , myself and er the management , er although we , we obtained a lot of facilities for the workers , a lot of facilities . 
105800:85	###It was a very nice firm . ###I enjoyed er very much that it was job . 
105846:17	###He used to go to school erm Mr , I think that was the headmaster same sort of name . ###Er and he said he 's very weak in his studies . 
105853:7	###So that worked . ###Now he 's a doctor in , he 's a senior housemaster in erm , er hospital , Sutton Coalfield . 
105904:44	###Still do ? ###Mm , normally er people who ca n't afford , hesitate to walk around . 
105905:92	###Mm , normally er people who ca n't afford , hesitate to walk around . ###I , I do hesitate myself because if I walk around normally I have to suffer a lot of abuse by , not by , people by who are walking round , but the people who are passing by in the cars etc . 
105907:142	###And youngsters normally er when , when they pass by , they will certainly say , at your back , something nasty and so er there is no way just have to an tolerate it unless , until we want to end up in , behind the bars . ###Has it become worse or better since you first arrived here ? 
105907:269	###And youngsters normally er when , when they pass by , they will certainly say , at your back , something nasty and so er there is no way just have to an tolerate it unless , until we want to end up in , behind the bars . ###Has it become worse or better since you first arrived here ? 
105908:78	###Has it become worse or better since you first arrived here ? ###Erm it has become worse in a way that er we did , I did experience some sort of er , er racial intolerance er with the youth , but the middle-aged and the er m older people were very , very er tolerant I had to ask er when I could n't find my way , ask my way to certain places and er there was an that er the lady just walked by me er with me and she , she said I 'll have to walk with you you ca n't find it . 
105941:49	###Er there has been cases where er there has been er some sort of erm affairs between men and women but the majority and psychological er think way of thinking that er the Asian woman always think of their husbands only , nothing else . ###Er a , they are dependent on them in many ways , b , if they desert , they 're not acceptable to this society . 
105972:10	###You 've got such a wonderful array down there . ###I was looking at them . 
105995:135	###Last time er it was er free distribution , so they needed someone to , workers for that and Sikh temple offered their services and er , I think they did the job very well because mostly we get a lot of volunteers round and er , many times I went their there was quite a big queue , er five or six people were serving at the same time . ###They undertook to do it for the whole of the Caldmore area did they ? 
106007:154	###Erm tell me about these assemblies in the school . ###What do you do ? 
106027:7	###Would n't dare to . ###It was n't that they could n't speak , they did n't no how to speak , they did n't no how to speak but they could n't . 
106063:147	###But from then onwards , they were always asking me to join , but by then I had already opened a young wives ' belonging to the church . ###The vicar had asked me in the war to do this and erm I was secretary of that and I used to say er , you know you could only do so much because we was n't like housewives today . 
106078:22	###Erm why , why do you think your mother was so keen on the Co-op ? ###What was it that er attracted her to it ? 
106107:70	###We met upstairs , in a room upstairs you see and this is where you got all your contacts and of course , the men all knew you . ###I remember as a young woman before I , even when I was courting , a young boys was there writing little notes behind the counter trying to make dates with me you know erm er it was , oh it was more than a shop . 
106146:74	###This was , this was after the war was it , after ###Oh gosh yes . 
106156:170	###Oh , well I think it was different to what we 're doing now . ###I mean I 'm pleased with the way the dividend stamps are helping the hospitals , which is a , a very , very good thing but erm , I think we did a very good job . 
106157:7	###I mean I 'm pleased with the way the dividend stamps are helping the hospitals , which is a , a very , very good thing but erm , I think we did a very good job . ###You got a very good committee , dedicated committee erm who , you see the young trainees were sent to the technical colleges and you see , erm some of them did go on if they graduated to Stanford Hall , but I mean those that went to technical college , we used to have to get the committee to sit in at the examinations . 
106160:197	###Er , we were , as I say , responsible more or less for staff erm and er so we were pretty busy really . ###Erm I , I think it was er you know a good thing that in a way that it was parted and made er staff , you know , training officer and business you know , sort of thing . 
106202:82	###Working womens ' organisations you get co-opted on and the , we were known for the way , the business-like way we run our meeting you know . ###Erm for instance , you go to one meeting and erm you would just sort of , mind you I think probably you may not agree , young people perhaps think this is the best way . 
106208:27	###This has been , you know we 've always , and we always go for the rule by the vote , one vote per member and er , we stick to our rules . ###We have our little rule book and we let a woman come into the Guild for a few weeks and then she 's told the rules . 
106208:65	###This has been , you know we 've always , and we always go for the rule by the vote , one vote per member and er , we stick to our rules . ###We have our little rule book and we let a woman come into the Guild for a few weeks and then she 's told the rules . 
106209:9	###We have our little rule book and we let a woman come into the Guild for a few weeks and then she 's told the rules . ###Er one of the rules is you must belong to the Co-op you , you know and er you must have a Pound share in the Co-op you see . 
106220:18	###But erm we 're very , very business-like . ###But we 've found out er that we have er we still keep our programme erm I can show you my programme book . 
106225:28	###But we in Walsall er I say Walsall is West Midlands er been very , very lucky . ###I 'm always stressing this to my people because we do get a room rent , a gra and we get a grant every year according to how many members you 've got . 
106225:156	###But we in Walsall er I say Walsall is West Midlands er been very , very lucky . ###I 'm always stressing this to my people because we do get a room rent , a gra and we get a grant every year according to how many members you 've got . 
106234:197	###If I could just ask you what sort of activities the Guild , the Guilds are actually involved in today ? ###Er well er I think , I do n't think they are so politically activated and this is where you have n't got your forthcoming erm members on committees . 
106258:227	###Er we had er buy a bucket of water campaign and we did erm er you know I , we went in local shops selling little stickers and it all went to and the wells have been dug and I believe Afghanistan has got wells that have been dug with , through the er Womens ' Guild . ###Er we , we do worldwide , we do sort of take an interest , but that again is linked up with your Co-operative International erm is n't really , you see . 
106305:7	###Did your , did your mother talk at all about the er the nineteen twenty-six Great Strike ? ###Oh yes , of course , yes , of course . 
106383:11	###I said in my teapot there is a little , and he told you to use white tide and you put a little bit of tide in it once a week . ###I said what I do is if I 'm going , I know say , Fridays , I 'm going shopping , gonna be out nearly all day , put , put it in the tide in , it comes out and I can show you my teapot , it 'll be , it is clean now .

106395:10	###Oh definitely , definitely I think they did . ###But of course we were very strongly against it really but er , because th you know we 'd been inundated with all these marvellous ideas of this progress and it 's all for the best and everything , but it does n't seemed to have work does it really ? 
106480:19	###ninety ninety one prices went up thirteen percent on average , and in ninety one ninety two by fifteen percent . ###The increases have been less of late because inflation 's dropped and we 've reduced our K value . 
106491:14	###We have the Drinking Water Inspectorate that monitors the quality of water that we put into your taps . ###And in nineteen ninety two , ninety nine point seven percent of all the samples that were taken , met all the standards . 
106492:7	###And in nineteen ninety two , ninety nine point seven percent of all the samples that were taken , met all the standards . ###And the standards we have to meet are rigorously laid down regulations . 
106533:7	###But why is it that we 're called the dirty man of Europe ? ###Our data 's available that 's why . 
106611:40	###And those are gonna push up costs . ###Now the director general of the watchdog is your friend . 
106704:13	###So that the cost . ###But it 's early days yet and there 's no there 's no definite answer . 
106760:61	###What we 've done in North Notts is to sink some new bore-holes . ###And we are blending water supplies so that we can we can meet whatever limits are are applicable or appropriate . 
106783:7	###And changing the washers usually does the trick . ###Erm we expect to see improvements on chlorine , but I ca n't give you a time . 
106787:12	###No . ###Not everything . 
106830:7	###This is Severn Trent Water International , it 's not Severn Trent the local firm as it were . ###It 's important that the company that side of the business , because e profits are there for the taking . 
106861:15	###And you know the sums were horrendous . ###Millions of pounds worth of damage . 
106863:7	###I mean they had to abandon the bore-hole . ###And prevention is better than cure . 
106870:7	###Well I know but the average figure I mean there ###Erm 
106882:69	###But the more appliances you have , the more washing machines , er more appliance washing machines , the more dishwashers , garbage grinders and this is sort of ilk . ###That 's gonna push the water consumption higher . 
106918:8	###What would it cost to in for me to install a meter in my house ? ###The meters are supplied free of charge , it 's er you can either o it yourself or you can get your local plumber to fit it . 
107019:98	###procedure but we 'd already done that . ###So 
107031:82	###An analysis of what people have done is likely to be useful not only in ascertaining what they 're likely to do but also what their linguistic needs are . ###he 's just saying that in a group if we look at the historical background of the language , it helps to see you know how What the strong points are of the linguistic and what we need to be bolstered on . 
107096:36	###Okay . ###Erm . 
107245:46	###Erm the similarity attraction model tends only to emph to emphasize the rewards of convergent . ###Erm I E an increase in attraction or approval the other person . 
107270:68	###Now there 's two different things you can do , there 's one which you were originally gonna do when it was a project . ###Mm . 
107292:9	###we 're asking people to make an informed choice ###Mm . 
107317:9	###had been I dunno a very then you can say , Oh so it does n't really show very much . ###But if you have a reasonable cross section of the country and your result was still that Birmingham was looked down upon as a low status accent , then at least you can your results so . . 
107319:46	###Would you have to say why ? ###Why you 
107341:15	###Mm . ###And s I mean that 's a a sort of non-linguistic of the people use but you sort of 
107342:9	###And s I mean that 's a a sort of non-linguistic of the people use but you sort of ###I suppose you have to into something linguistic then ? 
107466:41	###Well what what you could do is put in brackets somewhere a list of accents you can think of so that if people really do n't know what to do . ###Yeah so you 've got a list 
107490:5	###But and that takes away that initial reaction . ###Yeah . 
107505:17	###you 've got some complicated ones . ###Er and then you can write it up sometime during week four and hand it in sort of Wednesday , Thursday week four would be quite good . 
107516:12	###Mm . ###just a 
107524:13	###we could do the first bits and about an hour really , this weekend not at work or anything . ###No cos we 've we 've got the first two bits , we 've got the rational for the experiment and the method 
107525:10	###No cos we 've we 've got the first two bits , we 've got the rational for the experiment and the method ###What do we have to do ? 
107541:27	###But why do we do the experiment then ? ###Oh I dunno . 
107547:58	###So if next week c you can at least of started ###three hours a week 
107608:55	###What ? ###I 'm not quite sure when the official handing in date for this essay is , because of the fact that some essays have overrun from last term . 
107635:117	###Erm also if you look at entertainment , like James Saville calls himself Jimmy Saville , Terence Wogan is Terry Wogan , so but then you look at people like Charlie Chaplin , when he was doing his comedian role he was c he called himself Charlie Chaplin , and when he 's directing films he called himself Charles Chaplin , so maybe it 's all like a bit of a serious thing . ###So maybe that implies that when do the kids have got that ee ending . 
107673:63	###Right . ###that women uses use minimal responses anyway , then then you know like all males speak a male did n't use minimal responses 
107760:9	###some students were given shown some s some utterances ###Mhm . 
107764:53	###this women says that all ###Yes I mean in a sense that just sort of shows that a lot of people would agree with Lakehoff in the sense that they think that women use a lot of tag questions and have that speech style , erm I mean like we 've been able to see , and what we can say is that men and women 's language is different er and it 's even possible to say in what way it 's different , but the difficulty becomes when we actually want to say why those differences are . 
107831:53	###It got cancelled ? ###Oh right , did n't hear that then . 
107845:15	###Yeah . ###I 'm so confused about what 's going on . 
107893:40	###sort of everything we 've had so far 's been pretty general . ###Okay if any of you wanted to you could always go out some tape recorder and people have a listen to it . 
107895:153	###But obviously if you 're going to do that you 'll have to do it during next week some time On the other hand I could give you a list of five topics and you could choose one . ###Yeah Oh yeah I mean there 's five five things five things in men or women 's conversation t to do and essay about . 
107927:108	###Yeah well if you want to that then that 's fine as well , I mean that Tell you what , the best thing then is can everyone put a note in my pigeon hole by Monday in other words , you 've got the weekend to decide for definite . ###Gives us just like a provisional title of what the essay will be , on what your essay will be . 
108200:52	###To erm run some business and financial planning management courses . ###So Steve and myself are er have done a done a bid that we should know today whether or not it 's going to the main group , and if it goes to the main group , there 's a great chance it 'll be accepted . 
108279:54	###Well I mean she No I do n't know no . ###But I imagine it 'll all be people on that list who were involved in training , I ca n't remember . 
108316:14	###Oh . ###Unless we can shift it up here . 
108363:30	###it 's er ###But you do n't have it ? 
108389:22	###The paper that went to er C C S M T , erm was really a similar one but just partly with a bit more erm details . ###And where we were with investors in people . 
108398:12	###Picking up after T two M . ###Erm anything on career 's libraries , and anything on reviewing the C E G framework document . 
108465:14	###Mm . ###Just changed from a leased t 
108468:58	###Yeah . ###part of the the thing . 
108468:115	###Yeah . ###part of the the thing . 
108484:18	###Mm . ###I do n't know . 
108499:12	###And the competence checklists came from that training course I was on , that 's saying everybody , as well as having a job description , you 've got to have a competence ch checklist , for that that er helps you to develop the training for the job , depending on the competencies you need . ###And that 's gonna be a a bit of a er challenge I think . 
108500:54	###And that 's gonna be a a bit of a er challenge I think . ###But we obviously have to do it , just for the the levels of job . 
108503:46	###And then when we had the brainstorm , as I said . ###And then the cost benefit , evidence of need , I I drew out a f a paper . 
108658:68	###colleges and you know , different places . ###And and the visits seem to be more popular , and often quite a few careers officers will put their names down for that . 
108819:10	###Right . ###So we 've got the I think that to to fulfil I I P requirements , we 've gotta put out some it would be useful to put out something like a training and and development policy . 
108834:22	###No that 's too advanced Cynthia . ###But we do n't 
108905:23	###Mm . ###Are we supposed to be using the pre-course questionnaires that I 've seen a couple of times , on all course ? 
108908:22	###Erm er I mean er technically it should be something that 's done centrally . ###And I 'm trying to I 've tried without success . 
108908:60	###Erm er I mean er technically it should be something that 's done centrally . ###And I 'm trying to I 've tried without success . 
108959:46	###Evaluating everybody . ###checking up on people and evaluating 
108979:47	###Yeah and and Yeah . ###It 's a cultural thing is n't it really ? 
109001:44	###to to say to people , If you 're coming on the course this is what you 're going to get . ###Talk to your manager about personally and and you know corporate objectives and and go from there . 
109002:33	###Talk to your manager about personally and and you know corporate objectives and and go from there . ###So I think that 's something that we we 're going to have to . 
109010:15	###I know who you mean yeah . ###Bruce 's men . 
109023:17	###Yeah . ###now ? sort of thing . 
109067:33	###No but it will be . ###Obviously 
109206:28	###That 's that 's true yes . ###Yeah . 
109221:11	###And say , Come in Or Graham even . ###Mm . 
109221:33	###And say , Come in Or Graham even . ###Mm . 
109266:12	###It 's just gathering the the evidence is n't it really that 's difficult ###So so if it if it was 
109308:12	###But ###Mm . 
109359:11	###Oh it is yes . ###ways up . 
109407:100	###mm . ###where I did my placement .

109803:9	###I mean by the time you get to a two years . ###It 's excuse me ca n't we make up our own language 
109804:9	###It 's excuse me ca n't we make up our own language ###do we have to use . 
110464:14	###Oh I like ice cream . ###I 'm I 'm very partial to ice cream . 
110692:4	###Mhm . ###all that jazz . 
110944:9	###Oh of course . ###we usually if I want a cheque signed you see or 
111059:18	###Right . ###Mhm . 
111174:36	###As well as being flat it was very cheap . ###look at then if it 's municipal . 
111453:13	###Oh listen Margaret do you know looking for the the plinth in the drawer . ###No we 'll find it . 
111582:14	###The other thing is we sometimes get children around and they come and they just want to buy . ###You know two tickets . 
112042:30	###We 'll have them there now , a good pair of earrings. have them there . ###Fifty pounds for them . 
113136:14	###Erm , what we have tried to do at , there are You 've probably seen or heard in the last five or six years , the influence of Japanese technology . ###And you ca n't transpose totally Japanese technology into the Western hemisphere , but they have some good ideas . 
113177:28	###Your continuous improvement in in the factory a lot over the years . ###What is your relationship with the unions in the in the plant ? 
113183:22	###And it 's taken that length of time to break down the seventy or eighty year barriers that are in existence between workers and management . ###Erm and i think there will always be , for some time yet , a wee bit of distrust there , on both sides . 
113190:36	###But no , it was very difficult at first . ###It 's still difficult at times , erm there is nothing forced into them , it 's all through mutual discussion . 
113213:7	###They are I would say , ninety percent semi- skilled . ###we have trained them in er in fact in the operations they 're doing . 
113251:9	###Erm and it 's the same criteria worldwide . ###We have corporate headquarters obviously dictate policy . 
113279:28	###Guys were hanging about , standing all over the place , not their backside . ###That 's the impression they have of . 
113564:38	###But ###Do n't rush at it . 
113567:88	###Mhm . ###You did . 
113605:7	###Aye . ###and they can look at this anytime . 
113730:7	###And er we er ploughed through this until tonight , and er I think I 'm right , Mr returning officer , say that we 're the first Euro constituency in the northwest to get to this stage . ###So erm in spite of all the odds of trying to get a candidates a at the beginning , and finding that there was n't one available , and it would n't Is n't one e well not did n't exist . 
113732:77	###I must say that street , er they were a little busy at the time with Newbury and Christchurch and who can blame but them that they were very successful . ###If er if we can be as successful next June , I 'd be very happy . 
113733:48	###If er if we can be as successful next June , I 'd be very happy . ###Erm well what we decided on the the procedure was that we 'd toss a coin , in front of you all , we must be democratic , and some Either of these two gentleman is going to say heads or tails , and whoever wins can choose either to go erm first or second . 
113751:31	###Er if you just let look . ###So I 'm The time is going to be as per my watch . 
113760:189	###My name 's John and I am indeed from Ahzelgrove local party in the Euro constituency of Greater Manchester East . ###And to get one thing out of the way , straight away . 
113763:64	###Erm being more serious , erm Marple is n't very far away and it only took me thirty minutes to get from my house in Marple to here , tonight , and although some of the constituency 's further away than this and that is actually one of the main considerations , and we 're local . ###Erm the European election 's next year , Europe , the issue . 
113769:30	###And it struck me straight away that although the twentieth century as it marched on made us look more and more like Americans , we are Europeans , we always have been Europeans , our roots are there , our culture 's there and of course in the late twentieth century our economic needs , and the geographical links , the electronic links mean that we are there whether we like it or not . ###And I 'm proud to be a European and believe in Europe as well as accepting the realities . 
113779:8	###Education . ###Planning for transport , things like that . 
113779:29	###Education . ###Planning for transport , things like that . 
113781:35	###We have to learn form them , we have to be in with them , we are Europeans , and that is our destiny . ###And it 's the Liberal Democrats , friends , that have got the best policies on these things . 
113793:32	###But whatever , we are keen on it now , we should always have been , and if you treat people at the work place just like dirt , if you continue to turn Britain into a sweat shop , drive down wages , drive down people 's rights , then you may get some form of external investment come into this country , but we will never compete with the Dutch and the Germans and the Scandinavians , and we will never have a happy and united country . ###I 'm proud that we are now , fully , in line with the social contract . 
113798:92	###So We 've got the right policies , I believe in Europe , I 'm sure you round the room here tonight do , it 's an issue we 've got to raise . ###Now what about the coming campaign . 
113804:79	###The objectives are surely that we do the Liberal Democrats some real good , both nationally and in this area , in the longer term as well as for next June . ###Until we remove the present government from Westminster , then Europe is going to struggle to do us a great deal of good . 
113808:32	###Even if some of the signs of upturn , of turn around , of better things to come the government are trying to trumpet at the moment . ###Even if they turn out to be right , some of them , they still have British Rail privatization , they still have VAT on fuel , they still have rising water charges , they still have the education wrangle . 
113812:36	###I want us to get a thoroughly good vote in this Euro constituency , by maximizing our effectiveness . ###Getting out , to vote for us , the people who will vote for us . 
113827:24	###Erm obviously to look for the start of a campaign team as soon as possible . ###So that we 've got a running organization that can react to things , and indeed proact as well . 
113843:24	###We do do things well , generally speaking , in Stockport . ###And I 've been the leader of of that party for the last four and half years , I am ready to step down from that , and ready to take up this challenge , and I believe that those experiences , and what I 've done there , will stand me in good stead . 
113845:12	###Because some of the time the candidate has to be some of the other things as well . ###You 'll want other people to be you campaign manager , your agent , your press agent and whatever . 
113846:33	###You 'll want other people to be you campaign manager , your agent , your press agent and whatever . ###But sometimes you have to do them yourself . 
113847:56	###But sometimes you have to do them yourself . ###And it 's good to know that if you have to , you can . 
113876:33	###The jobs that people need good education to do . ###But the problem of people be being trained for jobs , and then the jobs not being there , I 'm afraid at the moment is European wide . 
113877:10	###But the problem of people be being trained for jobs , and then the jobs not being there , I 'm afraid at the moment is European wide . ###And my own feeling about this is that we do have to move more to planned expansion . 
113878:19	###And my own feeling about this is that we do have to move more to planned expansion . ###We do have to take a leaf , a little bit out of Kenzie 's book from the n the late nineteen thirties and afterwards , that when things are receding , you do n't batten down the hatches , you do n't simply close things in . 
113893:9	###We have one of the lowest standard pensions for a for an O A P in the whole of western Europe . ###and and certainly part of wanting the social contract is to is to give a level of decency to to our people . 
113900:26	###Er the er existing Euro M P , Gary , ###Mm . 
113926:48	###He thought it was too inflexible . ###It turns out now that reality is coming to countries all over western Europe , and although I 'm s I 'm sorry to see the difficulties that our colleagues and friends in western Europe are having erm they are beginning to realize that one or two aspirations of the so social contracts may be extremely expensive . 
113929:44	###And I think as time 's gone on our party had just realized wit the stresses and strains of more and more right wing pressure to destroy workers rights and drive wages down . ###Including for example the scraping of the wages councils which comes up , I think , later this week does n't it ? 
113929:67	###And I think as time 's gone on our party had just realized wit the stresses and strains of more and more right wing pressure to destroy workers rights and drive wages down . ###Including for example the scraping of the wages councils which comes up , I think , later this week does n't it ?

113930:166	###Including for example the scraping of the wages councils which comes up , I think , later this week does n't it ? ###Erm that the time has now come to accept that we do have to do the same things and it has to be in black and white and it has to be E E C wide . 
113956:60	###And we all want an E C for example , with citizens ' rights , with th with the social contract , erm a civilized , prosperous E C . ###If too many coun countries come into the E C as full members before they 're ready then I 'm not sure that that would n't , in fact , obviate some of the things that the recent legislation and the Maastricht treaty , to which we 're committed , would do . 
113962:47	###Good evening . ###Erm for the er people , in general terms , feel given the er bogeyman that er we 're going wholeheartedly into Europe , into this country . 
113966:36	###Because people who feel like that feel it very deeply and very sincerely . ###I think it can be tackled from one or two different ways . 
113981:18	###But we 're not Americans , we 're not part of the ecosphere or when when when we 're we 're we 're not part of their economic erm er area , which of course is being built on E C lines now . ###Their trade zone with central America and Canada . 
114054:7	###If you 're suggesting that the Manchester Evening News are proactively against the Liberal Democrats or that they would obstruct erm us in getting a fair crack of the whip , you may well be true , but I think we 've got that obstacle overcome , perhaps , in every stage . ###Because we 're not one of the two main parties . 
114074:94	###Well I think no greater no other individual but Paddy Ashdown has been providing a healthy lead , but sadly it 's one where he 's been citing a a an approach to Bosnia one month . ###The following month the government say oh we ca n't possibly do that , and four or five months later they hap they happen to do it . 
114079:42	###I think there is a moral obligation on the E C , not necessarily the Americans because it is a European problem , to intervene at least to the extent of ensuring protection for ordinary civilians and ensuring that they get food and medical s provision . ###Now the political can not be imposed . 
114090:35	###I 've just ###That 's right . 
114109:27	###In terms of the general transport policy , we have go to address the issue of the motor car . ###Are we going to allow it to determine our policy or is our policy going to determine the car ? 
114109:58	###In terms of the general transport policy , we have go to address the issue of the motor car . ###Are we going to allow it to determine our policy or is our policy going to determine the car ? 
114110:110	###Are we going to allow it to determine our policy or is our policy going to determine the car ? ###And I think it 's going to have to be the latter , we are going to have to decide , and the M twenty five enlargement is the critical debate at the moment . 
114112:8	###Are we going to go for fourteen lane high way , or motorway , on the M twenty five , cos if you do , all the roads that lead from it are going to have to be fourteen lane . ###I think we 've got to draw the line and say there is going to be a cost to our econ our ecology , if we allow it to run in the way the government have in mind .

116762:77	###I 've got that down and I do n't know what it says . ###What does Acts four twelve say , 
117031:19	###before God . ###Yes yes . 
117490:9	###I think it is right to refresh your memory as long as I live , in the tent of his body . ###Because I know that I will soon put it aside , as our Lord Jesus has made clear to me . 
117676:9	###We always associate humanity with sin , course we do ###Yes . 
117798:7	###Yes of course ###God and 
118139:12	###Mm . ###Mm . 
118281:12	###It 's the hauteur . ###Yes . 
118393:7	###More so than what you think . ###Does the lord wind up hill all the way , the very end . 
118445:27	###Yeah . ###We 've got three choices , we can either say let 's give it a go back at your original job , and it might be a bit job . 
118465:10	###Never have been . ###Oh well . 
118465:24	###Never have been . ###Oh well . 
118623:15	###Oh . ###But er apparently got a solicitor . 
118647:40	###But it 's a long process . ###I mean we have dealings with solicitors for all sorts of things , asking for reports and we send a lot of notes away to have a lot of er medical opinion reports and they take ages to come back . 
118655:13	###it looks like that in your case . ###We 
118687:43	###And you you come off worse than anyone else and er but there 's no real way of speeding that up , they ca n't give ###No . 
118692:26	###Mm . ###Oh right . 
118701:17	###let her go home Friday , discharged her the day after . ###She 'd put too much weight on it , and she 's back in hospital , she 's broke it . 
118750:6	###Well it 's If the police are doing the prosecuting then you may ###Yeah . 
118756:71	###Right . ###and he said he would b represent . 
118899:9	###Right , this is his right thumb , is he right handed ? ###Yeah . 
118900:22	###Yeah . ###Will he have to go on the 
118946:48	###Okay , do n't turn right , do n't turn left , go straight on . ###And the car parks are to the right and the main entrance is on the left and you just keep going straight on straight on straight on straight on and the bottom left hand corner is casualty . 
119010:12	###That 's ###Er 
119071:7	###understand what I mean , so ###Well 
119170:9	###Mm . ###been playing up a bit . 
119171:38	###been playing up a bit . ###So I had to get out of bed and turn over . 
119541:63	###And I sit on the immunization su subcommittee anyway , so they better not dare . ###They wo n't they wo n't dare . 
119746:21	###Mm . ###I 'm not going to tell you to do anything , that 's not what I 'm here for , but er 
119808:72	###You do n't like coming to doctors . ###What can I do for you this morning ? 
119934:32	###We 'll give you twice a day but a slightly bigger dose so that 's actually five hundred milligrammes twice a day . ###Give you a hundred and eighty which is three months worth of those . 
119946:17	###Now there 's two important things , first thing is your notes will take a long time to get up there maybe up to three months . ###Right . 
119952:44	###Convoluted , but that 's the way it goes and we ca n't actually release the notes to anyone but the local people in Nottingham . ###So we ca n't send them up to your doctor . 
120333:10	###going to be round about three weeks time . ###Yeah . 
120402:22	###Certainly ###Yeah . 
120658:20	###But because of that you 've got to watch it 's effect on the kidneys , on the body biochemistry . ###Mm . 
120784:10	###Oh right . ###do anything with that , . 
120825:21	###But if you actually deliberately ask them to write promptly . ###And the eye department 
120932:15	###that goes to sine squared . ###Right where your twelve comes from . 
121105:53	###Yeah . ###And sometimes I mean there , we sort of let . 
121335:20	###But that , that is a Y equals something X to the tenth , so it 's it 's not going to have a gradient that requires Y equals something to the tenth . ###Mm . 
121397:10	###you could n't differentiate that . ###Mm . 
121398:10	###Mm . ###You 'd have to do what we did on the other page . 
121471:60	###Mhm . ###And er I 've been there all my life and that 's and that 'll be eighty seven years old come May and er I 've just worked on the farm all my days and er then of course when my people died I just er stayed myself , and then lived with other people here and there , just to help them . 
121483:45	###Oh yes oh well just ordinary country country days , just you worked on the farm . ###You got up in the early morning and helped in the farm , milked the cows , fed my cows and calves and looked the pigs , and then you 'd hens and chickens and the pet lambs and things like that . 
121485:59	###And then of course at er the time of the lambing time you had to go out and help with the lambing time , you know , to help the shepherds with If he 'd a weakling lamb you 'd always to bring it in the house and then feed it in a bottle . ###Mm . 
121486:59	###Mm . ###And keep it warm and then er if you had er Then you had the chickens to you had to set the clucking hens and and bring out as many chickens as you could . 
121487:60	###And keep it warm and then er if you had er Then you had the chickens to you had to set the clucking hens and and bring out as many chickens as you could . ###And then after , in the winter , and then after that when it was near hay time , I had to go out and help with the hay . 
121504:9	###But it was er in er our country district it was er hay coles tramp coles then . ###And then after the hay time it was er wearing on to harvest time . 
121555:54	###And built er well well you was when you was building the hay the harvest You see the sheaves was different you see ? ###They were all built round and round and up until they came to what they called the the e the part of the stack where they begin to to make it up to the top , you see ? 
121561:63	###Well er they did them They made them f f fancy kind of things on the top like a They would maybe crisscrosses and things like that and m make a rounded thing like a Just like what some folk has a tassel on their bonnets , well we made that on the top of the stack . ###And every farm used to Farmer lad used to see where Who could make the best looking one . 
121611:12	###Yes the tinkers used to come up from Blair Gowrie to to do that long ago . ###I remember myself , one time we had we had two grand fields and it were They were almost ripe when it came an awful time of rain , and they were just a sort of flattened . 
121616:32	###They had their their scythes to cut them with , you see ? ###And then the the men cut the like that and then the women s they lifted the , and the next lad he stuck them so that it was a very busy time . 
121616:189	###They had their their scythes to cut them with , you see ? ###And then the the men cut the like that and then the women s they lifted the , and the next lad he stuck them so that it was a very busy time . 
121728:7	###How they killed the pig ? ###Oh it was a great day the day the pig was killed . 
121737:54	###And it hu go And it was there and it was left all night , and next day erm the man came back again and he cut it down the back with a big saw , and divided it up and then it was taken to the house where it was er up and then salted in a big barrel . ###And then , before that , if you if you was to make the mealy puddings the it that always had to be cut into bits and emptied and washed well in cold water , and with salt and that , and that was They would done that for three days before they were then filled up to make the mealy puddings . 
121752:171	###They ha the er When it was cut up like that , in the house there was er ###Cleaks 
121814:7	###And the abbots used to come up and then they would stay and have their meal in Kilray down at what they called the aiden or the tavern , and then they would walk over the hill of Kilray right up until they came to Dalvaine . ###And I suppose it was some of my great grandfathers or some of them , had the looking after of them . 
121964:25	###Mm . ###days and er but And so the father saw that he was safely there and the other Then when he came back he went into the house and said to Duncan er Was you speaking to the old John old John MacGregor and f He said I was that and he said I 'll let you see what my man got , and this was the little bag of gold . 
121989:41	###So where do you think he went for the winter ? ###Oh it 'll likely have been about Blair Gowrie or Pitlochry or some place , just anybody who would have taken him in . 
122133:7	###Did you ever dance the Patronella ? ###Patronella was one of the favourite ones , aha . 
122198:9	###But did they have their routes ? ###Oh they had their routes yes . 
122309:7	###I never ever did it myself like . ###Aye you did that , ye d That was why you did And you did your neeps . 
122317:7	###Mhm . ###They did that with the neeps so that when the man came along with a cart they could throw them , you see . 
122403:24	###Mhm . ###Just as soon as it was cut you In fact you 'd to go er ev everybody , in that day , you 'd maybe have maybe thirty yards and you 'd all those l sheaves , y that was your bit . 
122409:47	###Mhm . ###And what size was your sheaf ? 
122435:17	###Mm . ###over and then it tied it and then it was cu , then it fell down . 
122462:37	###No no . ###no no . 
122477:82	###How long would you leave your stooks in the field ? ###Oh just until they were dry maybe if it was a grand time of wind , maybe say three days . 
122493:20	###Well when the hay was dry , th it was raked up it was all er When it was cut it was lying in what we called swathes , you see ? ###And then maybe after it 'd been cut for two days , you were sent out to turn the swathes , up all you went along and you turned them and turned them . 
122522:21	###And how was it built ? ###Just the same . 
122522:34	###And how was it built ? ###Just the same . 
122607:34	###But father had a lot of Gaelic words . ###Mhm . 
122725:138	###But it did n't necessarily mean that they would stay together all the time the they may they may even fall out with one another . ###Er and one of them may decide that he was going to another job anyway , you know , and he would leave and somebody else would be brought in and what have you . 
122731:53	###Er invariably you would find up they broke up somewhere or other . ###And would an an apprentice , like somebody who 'd say served say five years as their time , once their time was out would it be common for them to be kept on ? 
122763:57	###Well it was a system that er was n't liked but it was operated because , in my opinion anyway , because the employers er had seen it as a way of getting more work out of you . ###Obviously er if er you came in in the morning and you were n't feeling to good , for whatever reason , then you could n't slack back and say och well I 'll just take my time with this . 
122769:75	###Er and they were actually bringing on there own unemployment . ###So what would a a riveter have done then once they were once their job was completed they were put on the the on the street basically ? 
122772:27	###Well I would say that erm , in my time , er when they became unemployed , most of them could pick up a job pretty easy because I was speaking about from nineteen forty eight onwards , and of course er it was shortly after a war , there was plenty of work , and therefore most of them could pick up a job in a reasonable space of time and they would n't be idle too long . ###But I daresay , if you were speaking to some of the older men in the shipyard er who had worked in a shipyard before my time , that er a lot of riveters , a lot of tradesmen of all all kinds , found it hard to get employment once they were they were sacked you know . 
122797:177	###Well I could n't just tell you honestly about that but I think the riveters decided who got what , you know . ###Mm . 
122812:27	###And the fact that it was divvied up in the pubs I ###Mm . 
122820:22	###On most occasions it would be a boy but I have seen men doing it . ###Mm and did they employ like boys from school ? 
122856:125	###Er so there was no official tea break . ###As far as toilets were concerned er the the toilets to me were absolutely diabolical , that nobody should have been asked to use them . 
122857:9	###As far as toilets were concerned er the the toilets to me were absolutely diabolical , that nobody should have been asked to use them . ###But there again er it was the time we lived in and you had certain Well yards had their own way of trying to keep track of when a guy was in a toilet etcetera and sometimes you would have to hand in y your er your time ticket , to the toilet attendant , and you would give him this ticket and he would say right you are , you know , and mark down your number on a book and say to you , well you 've got seven minutes or something you know . 
122916:12	###No . ###I was thinking maybe when the money was getting split up you know ? 
122927:12	###Mm . ###After after the boy The boy was paid so much to the pound then the rest was divided three ways by the two riveters and the the holder-on . 
122944:45	###No . ###Some of them could n't afford it . 
122945:15	###Some of them could n't afford it . ###Some of them could n't afford i You had I think you had to put something in . 
122946:15	###Some of them could n't afford i You had I think you had to put something in . ###I think you had to kind of build up 
122966:23	###And you ###could use that for your own family . 
122977:10	###Get everything practically that you needed from a black book . ###with a black book . 
122983:30	###A couple of days . ###It was usually up on a Tuesday was n't it ? 
122987:7	###A Mond A Monday or a Sa Aye well the Saturday . ###You know ? 
122994:51	###On the Tuesday the day that the Co was up . ###And after that your 
123008:26	###If you let somebody else get stuff on your book , and some of them could n't pay it , you know , you 've no means of paying it . ###You might pay it yourself . 
123044:9	###So anybody that had a big book accumulated all this dividend ###Maybe three or four hundred pounds worth of stuff out . 
123066:8	###Well the person that owned the book ###They would take it off your dividend . 
123066:69	###Well the person that owned the book ###They would take it off your dividend . 
123084:18	###So the debt would go then ? ###You would ? 
123100:56	###You got your messages week to week , it worked from Thursday to Thursday , right ? ###And you got a Your week 's messages every week . 
123103:30	###Every other week after that you paid them at the end every week , ###Mhm . 
123108:86	###Aha . ###good polish and things that they could n't really afford . 
123110:20	###That was a great week because they felt they were getting it for nothing , till it come to the end of the quarter and then they had to pay it . ###And 
123110:72	###That was a great week because they felt they were getting it for nothing , till it come to the end of the quarter and then they had to pay it . ###And 
123110:107	###That was a great week because they felt they were getting it for nothing , till it come to the end of the quarter and then they had to pay it . ###And 
123111:42	###And ###So to get this You had to pay this , because when it came to the end of the quarter , you had to get your shopping out of that Cooperative , so that had to be paid . 
123124:14	###It was easier for the man that came round with the Cooperative lorry to just take tokens ###So you 
123127:19	###Right . ###You see ? 
123177:14	###seems to mean child ###Would Was there people who would abuse 
123180:7	###just the same as you know ? ###Aye . 
123181:11	###Aye . ###You had to watch but if people came to your door in a in a state that er you knew it was a genuine case , you would probably help them out you know . 
123181:24	###Aye . ###You had to watch but if people came to your door in a in a state that er you knew it was a genuine case , you would probably help them out you know . 
123183:9	###And did you have to did you have to actually When you went to the shop , say to buy some messages , or to buy whatever erm in the drapery or whatever , ###Mm . 
123191:28	###Without the book . ###Oh no no , I mean there was people went and quoted the number . 
123206:7	###I think it always was Mostly always was you know . ###Mm . 
123208:7	###That must have been a one off . ###I never heard of that before really . 
123219:9	###Aye . ###Mhm . 
123286:17	###No because nobody el else give out tick . ###See you get . 
123312:63	###And you would have a a Co board as they called it ###Some of these women would be on it . 
123378:50	###Upstairs there be there was four rooms upstairs . ###But at that time it was n't what you 'd call modern in so far as you had n't got hot water from a sort of gas fir Electric heating . 
123380:33	###The bath , you had a bath room with a bath on the wall but you had to heat the water on a at the kitchen the kitchen fire . ###It were a old fashioned kitchen range where you 'd got a an oven on one side and a boiler on the other . 
123401:53	###Mhm . ###There was warm gas er in the hall . 
123519:58	###And what did you do with your er spare time as a school boy ? ###I Spare time as a school boy , I used to play either football in the winter or cricket in the summer . 
123520:7	###I Spare time as a school boy , I used to play either football in the winter or cricket in the summer . ###When I had spare time , but if you 'd If it was decent weather you 'd have to give a hand in the garden at home you see ? 
123523:11	###It 's alright at Although I 'd two brothers , on or two would be away from home from home at the s the same time . ###I was left . 
123606:11	###Giving the whole story Rad aconite , beruncial assay Britain , habitat Britain . ###use , root , liniment , you see ? 
123632:17	###A big copper boiler , with a little warm water and the heat would separate the oil , you see ? ###And then skim the oil off and drain it . 
123633:41	###And then skim the oil off and drain it . ###What extra did you have to do for humans ? 
123644:22	###And having made a couple of Winchesters , that 's er the big bottle , which was er eighty ounces . ###They were filled into two ounce , four ounce or , you know , depending on the size you you stocked and sold . 
123651:28	###you pulled it down ad you got the various size bottles in this we got half and one ounce , here two ounce , further up three ounce . ###All the way round . 
123751:29	###Oh but we got on . ###Oh yes . 
123838:34	###Someone tells me the other day that I , I 've you know y ###Yeah . 
123870:34	###Right . ###I 'll give these out first of all . 
123881:33	###Pass them along . ###If I can just introduce myself . 
124058:30	###In , occasionally we send out er we have like a , a neighbourhood news newspaper for Neighbourhood Watch schemes . ###And we 'll come and we 'll leave you a pile of newspapers to distribute . 
124066:44	###Mm . ###Go round and ask everybody in the area . 
124104:10	###They said they 'll contact the was out , and it was forgotten . ###Was it ? 
124218:8	###Yes . ###Well 
124244:37	###There 's , there 's drugs in there , there 's drug in that house , I 'm sure ###Hard stuff as well as the grass . 
124357:24	###That make sense ? ###Yes . 
124535:28	###Right so the first thing we , as a crime prevention officer , we , well I look at anyway , is surrounding areas of a house that ca n't be seen from the road . ###Is there any hedges there that restrict the view to the house ? 
124565:15	###That 's easy , easy one that . ###Er and it might be that er there 's a space there where a caravan looks as though it used to stand . 
124850:14	###Now the burglar alarm 's probably the , the biggest thing , but we ca n't all afford the , I mean I have n't got one and I 'm a crime prevention officer , I mean by rights I should have one but I have n't . ###So it , it wo n't suit everybody , you might not want , in my case I do n't particularly want to live with a burglar alarm . 
124863:93	###It might be having lights on like you mentioned . ###So when someone walks up with the intention of breaking in a light comes on , I mean at one time , it 's not the same now , but at one time when these lights with the detectors first came out , nobody actually knew whether they were switched on or not . 
124885:32	###nine times , nine times out of ten the , the er door the back door or the front door has got a great big pane of glass on top of it . ###Yeah . 
124889:42	###So I lock the bottom window . ###Yeah . 
124911:25	###All you want to do is , all you wanted to do just strike it in middle of glass go round it just ###I lived in my house for going on for a year 
124927:38	###Well I have n't really because I 've got double glazing . ###Yeah . 
124972:12	###Mm . ###Er they do n't particularly like to make a , a noise , but some , some do if it 's quick . 
125088:10	###in the ###No . 
125371:17	###I 'm nearly out of them . ###In fact I , I do n't think I am . 
125443:8	###that long , if you had a valid doctor 's note for that time , surely ? ###No , no . 
125496:11	###You know it 's a different ball game ###Mm . 
125693:26	###No pain at all ###No . 
125800:35	###if you go back even ###You think I could have some of that I pu i m Melorose or something , for dry eyes . 
125890:11	###But I do n't know what it is yet , so er ###Neither do I . 
125906:7	###Yeah . ###I mean you may find it 's not very easy to cut it down further until 
125984:27	###And the erm ni the , the , the capsules and the er Nitrous Albide I expect are the ones he 's going to change though the problem is exactly what to . ###Yeah , 
125984:111	###And the erm ni the , the , the capsules and the er Nitrous Albide I expect are the ones he 's going to change though the problem is exactly what to . ###Yeah , 
126038:19	###So I think we ought to have a chat about the sort of things he 's putting you on , and then what side effects or anything you might get from those , but ###Yeah . 
126050:54	###We did some blood tests , that 's right . ###We did . 
126061:10	###what we really need to do is keep an eye , if it looks like you keep leaking sugar out , ###Mhm . 
126202:57	###But the trouble is with muscle pulls , they heal fairly slowly . ###They tend to get worse over a fe over a few days , before they start to get better as well . 
126227:9	###And it 'll tend ###to flush things through . 
126448:24	###Er note , chest X-ray ###Do you want me to make an appointment next week , while I 'm here ? 
126562:9	###Right . ###It 's ordinary penicillin . 
126589:7	###Yeah . ###And er 
126699:64	###And that will really aggravate everything ###Yeah . 
126722:12	###and ###You 're fine . 
126805:15	###Okay . ###Because as soon as it starts to die down you could probably go back on to Betnovate to keep it maintained . 
127109:62	###like a month now he 's had it . ###Yeah , that 's a long time . 
127216:4	###And I thought , well I 'll just pop in chemist and I was hoping it would clear it up , so I would n't ###Yeah . 
127233:84	###Well it 's bit brighter at the coast , and ###Yeah . 
127252:23	###Because there 's a ten year ###Oh . 
127317:136	###But they 've refused to do that , and they insist on taking each case individually . ###Mhm . 
127442:48	###high levels of unemployment exist in the flats ? ###and erm er erm erm does n't necessarily bring people together , in fact , because it 's a , it , it 's a very isolating condition to be in . 
127583:132	###Mhm . ###And how many of you working on that ? 
127603:13	###Mhm . ###and wh and what the response of the tenants has been . 
127612:18	###Where would the case actually s where would it go to , I mean say when you 've got all the evidence ? ###What do you do with it then ? 
127612:32	###Where would the case actually s where would it go to , I mean say when you 've got all the evidence ? ###What do you do with it then ? 
127617:35	###Yeah . ###And so it would be a case of actually negotiating with the council hopefully ? 
127684:50	###And how do you see it as being an area to bring up kids ? ###In the flats themselves ? 
127778:28	###Erm there 's ###What kind of contact , do they have much contact with the people in the flats ? , you not sure if you 're not 
127786:10	###So there is quite a , a concentration of activity within the area . ###Whether or not that is actually used by the people who live in the flats , I do n't know , to be honest . 
127786:27	###So there is quite a , a concentration of activity within the area . ###Whether or not that is actually used by the people who live in the flats , I do n't know , to be honest . 
128038:104	###I mean I , I could s I could still get what I needed . ###Do you think a lot of people do that , or do you think you 're particularly sort of 
128116:11	###Will there be anything you miss about them ? ###As I say , only the heating and the hot water . 
128203:137	###Mm . ###Have , have you seen anything like that happen , or is ? 
128205:32	###Well I do n't know how true it is but I have heard from somebody I know , whose husband was a a plumber , and he came to unplug a toilet at the erm Cricket Players when it closed down , he had to unplug it . ###And he found a hell of a lot of flesh down the toilet , human flesh . 
128211:11	###I see . ###Er talking about er plumbers and er people like that , have erm have , how are you finding getti getting things repaired in the flat ? 
128211:23	###I see . ###Er talking about er plumbers and er people like that , have erm have , how are you finding getti getting things repaired in the flat ? 
128267:42	###Now we 're back to six people again and they 're all working for me in a very small way . ###Again working with the same sort of people , but in a very small and for our own as well . 
128381:9	###So productivity increased tremendously , and therefore it was going to be a success . ###Having said that , in order to get into production , or even to use it , you ca n't just set up in those days any more than you can today , now you need planning permission to , you need . 
128408:41	###I was working for the company er , in Leicester , called making cotton lisles for twelve years , fifteen years ago . ###And was still making his woolly still are , specialist . 
128416:7	###So this had an effect . ###It had an effect on the retail sector , the retail areas of the country erm the obvious thing is the chain store . 
128420:7	###Where you get everything so the knitwear or the clothing side more specialized , only had a section . ###So the chain stores took up the challenge . 
128424:13	###Marks and Spencers would n't take anyone on as a supplier unless you could produce at least two hundred dozen a week on one site . ###Two hundred dozen that was when I first started in the industry in the sort of la early sixties . 
128441:22	###That 's what we were good at . ###So we were good at the mass produced area for Marks and Spencers making nice wool garments like that . 
128441:42	###That 's what we were good at . ###So we were good at the mass produced area for Marks and Spencers making nice wool garments like that . 
128441:67	###That 's what we were good at . ###So we were good at the mass produced area for Marks and Spencers making nice wool garments like that . 
128443:7	###And the acrylics because the acrylic yarns had to be developed , new yarns had to be developed apart from machinery we had to develop yarns that would meet the demand . ###You could n't produce enough wool , you could n't produce enough cotton . 
128465:18	###That is a jacquard right ? ###Marks and Spencers ' garment again . 
128583:28	###That gives you an idea of the mark-up that the retailers put on the garment , which I do n't blame them for , they 've got their problems , I 've got mine . ###So that 's padded shoulders 
128645:101	###So that 's the first thing to realize , we 've got a multiply in there now we 've got this two piggy in the middle here , between an add and a times , so the times win . ###Yeah ? 
128689:52	###So what have we got ? ###We 'll , we 'll , we 'll do twenty three times a hundred and one , okay ? 
128913:97	###X times ten , ten X. X times Y , X Y . ###Okay . 
129157:24	###What does that come to ? ###Well it 's , leave that as it is , this bit comes to mi think of a minus one . 
129188:58	###Four . ###Ah . 
129273:22	###questions first to build up . ###Erm seventeen take away ten take away three . 
129522:10	###Erm it 's , it 's , negative numbers are n't a natural thing , fractions are actually easier and that was what happened in the history of mathematics , fractions were developed a long long time before negative numbers , the old Greeks used to play about with fractions quite a lot . ###Negative numbers came later . 
129560:9	###first thing is work out the current in the whole circuit . ###How are you going to do that ? 
129619:11	###What I 'm trying to do is trying to get it the way it will be in an exam so , cos in an exam you 're ###Ah . 
129677:12	###Make your voltage twice what it was , and keep everything else fixed , you 'll get twice the current . ###So that 's , that is the way that most people find is easiest to remember Ohm 's Law . 
129742:37	###All you 've got to do now is a little bit of maths to ###Right . 
129770:4	###The more I increase the resistance , the more current is getting through , oh it ###Mm . 
129788:68	###Yeah . ###start , what to do or anything so , you need a little bit of practice at doing them for , for revision and then it , it 's not nearly as hard as when you first learnt , it pulls it out of your head again and then sort of puts it back in a bit more settled down and easier to retrieve . 
129819:23	###So ###how to do it . 
129925:36	###We 've got so much going through the big wire , put another little wire on as well . ###Some more 'll go through that . 
130419:17	###Is it moving ? ###Yeah it 's , it 's circular er oh 
130434:29	###What 's happening there , you 've got , fuel 's making the engine go round . ###So using little things like that , so just a little box to show this is the alternator , that 's the energy for , this is the battery and this is the fuel . 
130526:33	###Yeah . ###And you 'll keep thinking of extra little bits he ah there 's another bit can go in there . 
130580:30	###pushing down me . ###pushing down . 
130750:9	###Put a piece of rope and , and stand on the end of it and pull . ###And I 've got to pull the of ladder in . 
130752:37	###So there must be a frictional force here , pulling the bottom of the ladder in . ###What 's the top of the ladder trying to do ? 
130801:111	###Yeah . ###So how are you , how are you getting on with your revision ? 
130801:133	###Yeah . ###So how are you , how are you getting on with your revision ? 
130805:17	###Okay . ###there and there 's C D T because for 
130844:81	###By the time we 've finished the book , bang we 're on top of the Easter holidays . ###Okay so get , yeah get , get those projects in . 
130850:86	###This pipe conducts so , so many gallons , that so many gallons . ###Conductance one equals conductance plus conductance three plus conductance four mm and so on . 
131469:10	###And he , and he ###and of course he was fair amazed . 
131473:19	###And er , he says er , he , he , he got a a got him across onto it , and he never spoke , and he walked round about it about three or four times and he s turned around to me and says , well , well , well . ###He says , here 's something , he says , we , we 've been looking for for years and here 's me stumbling on it accidentally . 
131480:43	###He says , oh yes , you 'll be Mr . ###I says , I am . 
131592:10	###Oh . ###So I 'm just , I 'll walk down , how far is it from here down to the main road along the road ? 
131871:24	###So I waited , he generally turned up , I 've seen him not be up home till eight and half past eight in the morning but he never turned up so about nine o' clock I says , I 'd better phone the police . ###So I phoned the police and I said , Charlie went away last yesterday , I says , and he has n't turned back up this morning . 
132012:49	###Mm . ###And they were only a s s a sort of infants and secondary school er there , and you . 
132012:58	###Mm . ###And they were only a s s a sort of infants and secondary school er there , and you . 
132026:119	###Were the conditions in the mines quite dangerous in those days ? ###Well in those days er there was n't much me much er coal cutting machine , this was all hewn by hand . 
132039:45	###Or eight hours for a full shift , sixteen hours for a double shift . ###Mm . 
132049:7	###That was the idea of the union starting out in the first place . ###Mhm . 
132159:9	###When you came back to Britain . ###Well I , well er I came back to Britain er I , I was er liberated by General Patton in a , a small place called Erfurt I was flown from Erfurt into Cherbourg , and from Cherbourg into a small place called Amersham which was a reception station for prisoners of war , where we were treated er on entering the camp we were handed a telegram . 
132188:45	###What was the conditions like in the building trade after the war ? ###Well er you know at that time there in the building trade there was er what they term a , an essential work order . 
132188:98	###What was the conditions like in the building trade after the war ? ###Well er you know at that time there in the building trade there was er what they term a , an essential work order . 
132190:21	###Which you had , the government , the government or building firms had to guarantee you forty four hours ' payment f of wages , forty four hours guaranteed and you had to get that whether you were working or not . ###So that was an essential work order was by the government in power then . 
132208:50	###All depending what sort of job your job , it could be dangerous if you did n't know what you were doing . ###I mean you could n't put a stranger on a job that you , you yourself . 
132222:16	###And it was always on that er tramcar , whichever er suburban district they were leaving , was always a packed car . ###Always fully laden . 
132229:45	###What on earth 's to stop , to have a transfer ticket , which could be used on any bus at all . ###So there would b take away this anomaly of old people having to use three buses to get from one end of the town to the other , which means , in actual fact , that each bus they went on to , they paid this ten pence , which if there 's three , if they do not turn it twice a week , twice a day , that 's sixty pence . 
132229:72	###What on earth 's to stop , to have a transfer ticket , which could be used on any bus at all . ###So there would b take away this anomaly of old people having to use three buses to get from one end of the town to the other , which means , in actual fact , that each bus they went on to , they paid this ten pence , which if there 's three , if they do not turn it twice a week , twice a day , that 's sixty pence . 
132254:17	###Well it erm it was average , it was average . ###Yes . 
132329:11	###Well er well it all depended on the individual themselves . ###If there 's a miner who 's in getting work . 
132406:57	###No no . ###in its infancy then . 
132406:93	###No no . ###in its infancy then . 
132406:110	###No no . ###in its infancy then . 
132406:177	###No no . ###in its infancy then . 
132418:9	###You always go building , we gutted right from ground floor , left the existing walls in . ###And then inside building we completely demolished inside , just sort of left the retaining walls and built it up from fourteen feet below the ground to five storeys , high , itself . 
132434:78	###but er the essential work contract then that I had spoken about in the first place the building trade , that was a government order . ###Essential , essential work which was operated during the war years and er what year a couple , several years after that . 
132435:18	###Essential , essential work which was operated during the war years and er what year a couple , several years after that . ###That was an essential b eventually that was taken away , but the building trade still believed if a building firm wanted men , they had to have at least a thirty two hour guarantee , which is at present still in operation . 
132444:49	###And a chap come out the offices and say right , you you you . ###So in actual fact it was always a favour cos I got the jobs . 
132479:60	###Oh no , not necessarily through the union , no no . ###I 've just had so solely an interest to defend myself . 
132481:41	###Ah but I believed if I 'm going to discuss or argue about anything as regarding that I had to be interested in it . ###And to be interested you 've got to attend your branch meetings and know what 's going on . 
132481:60	###Ah but I believed if I 'm going to discuss or argue about anything as regarding that I had to be interested in it . ###And to be interested you 've got to attend your branch meetings and know what 's going on . 
132514:49	###As far as the financial side of things goes . ###And er a g a good er and er , can be er the mi the name itself , the Scottish Old Age Pensions Association is not to be mistaken from er , sometimes it 's misread as the Scottish Old Age Pensioners ' Association . 
132637:22	###So I was n't , I was n't doing it all on my own , you understand my meaning ? ###I were n't doing it all although I sort of organized it . 
132707:39	###And we went up there and we had just we 'd , we took the labour rooms and er of course we had got a cup of tea with them you know ? ###And in comes Councillor the leader of the Labour group , you see ? 
132844:50	###Yes . ###Well that created er a great feeling of ambiguity in the minds of our members , erm mainly I think due to the fact that some of our colleagues you know , may have been a bit er apprehensive . 
132855:94	###Well can I say that er if I might say so first of all , I think that the , the antipathy that existed for a period actually came more from the workshop , rather than the management . ###And I was quite conscious of that . 
132856:9	###And I was quite conscious of that . ###But er at that time there was plenty work coming in , erm there was , there was no need for us to be apprehensive , and so therefore we had to convince the management that in the best interests of everybody , having agreed that the scheme would go on across the whole spectrum of the workforce , was to move reasonably , you know , quickly through the various machine departments and introduce with a minimum amount of frustration . 
132863:19	###Oh yes , er ###Did people get aggravated by it ? 
132904:9	###And this created a , a , a degree of efficiency . ###Er there 's no doubt in my mind that it was efficient erm and it was , it was controlling time . 
132910:134	###you know . ###Yes er although let me say this , that er there were many things which the management were required to do , for example , when we , when we went to our monthly meetings with them , we established monthly meetings with the management , one , in order to try and control from our side , er the , to have some control on the production er side of things . 
132910:157	###you know . ###Yes er although let me say this , that er there were many things which the management were required to do , for example , when we , when we went to our monthly meetings with them , we established monthly meetings with the management , one , in order to try and control from our side , er the , to have some control on the production er side of things .

132944:36	###But after the fire er Willy er requested you know that er the men should carry on working and , and we gave him our assurance that we would do our utmost you know , to keep the place er going . ###Er but having said that er h his it was , it was terrible . 
132961:44	###Erm there were new passageways , erm the management er er applied their thoughts to it and altered the , the layout and certain machines were , were put to one side of the machine shop and , and milling machines to the other side you know . ###Er and it looked more regulated . 
132961:61	###Erm there were new passageways , erm the management er er applied their thoughts to it and altered the , the layout and certain machines were , were put to one side of the machine shop and , and milling machines to the other side you know . ###Er and it looked more regulated .

132962:41	###Er and it looked more regulated . ###Er and the result was that the heavy casting you know , did n't have to travel the system had to be monitored correctly , you had to see that fair play er was the order of the day both in respect of the member and indeed the management to try and reach a er an agreement . 
132964:35	###Er but in order to introduce reasonable facilities for shop stewards , we had to make approaches to the management over a period of time . ###For instance we had no place to keep our er records , we had er minute books er we used to receive minutes from the management for example , after our monthly meeting with them , er and they were more or less dictated by the er personnel department , who were present at the meeting . 
132968:13	###Now it took several years for er the new incentive scheme to be introduced throughout the whole of the works and I think during my last discussion you know , I did indicate that the fitters for example , you know , were about the last group to go on . ###Er and by this time you had several departments , machine departments you know , involved in the process . 
132971:30	###It might have been a question of time , it may have been a question of tooling , it may have been a question of instruments , it may have been a question of materials , raw materials , or a compilation of all of these things . ###Er or indeed you know , the issue er of a job which had n't been done on a particular machine er but was timed on another one . 
132977:97	###Er which was kept in our custody . ###So were , were management quite flexible in that , in that they , you described they allowed , stewards monitored the , the incentive scheme , er they had two weekly meetings , were management quite flexible in that they gave you time off or er whatever ? 
132978:16	###So were , were management quite flexible in that , in that they , you described they allowed , stewards monitored the , the incentive scheme , er they had two weekly meetings , were management quite flexible in that they gave you time off or er whatever ? ###Well er in the early days , erm there were occasions where erm if I may say so , that , that just to divert for a moment , the scheme had to have supervision , and there was an increase in the staff , the number of foremen and chargehands increased . 
132979:7	###Well er in the early days , erm there were occasions where erm if I may say so , that , that just to divert for a moment , the scheme had to have supervision , and there was an increase in the staff , the number of foremen and chargehands increased . ###Primarily because the foremen had to regulate their own department as far as er input and output was concerned . 
132980:90	###Primarily because the foremen had to regulate their own department as far as er input and output was concerned . ###They had to regulate the er flow of materials , from the store to the individuals concerned . 
133055:37	###It was a fundamental principle that we never er er er put aside , because we felt that er well as I say if , if a company was being profitable , there was every reason why we should go in and increase our members ' er er standard of living . ###Do you have any recollections of any particular disputes and maybe an answer that you could possibly sort of , make a few comments on whether you felt the the procedures were worked out so finely that they in fact prevented disputes because they were so long and drawn out perhaps or er it took the fire out of disputes if you like ? 
133060:43	###Now local conference usually was held as quickly as possible erm but when you went to local conference as an official , you were then faced with obviously the employer who was concerned in the case , an independent chairman of the employers , but a battery of other members of the employers ' association who were unattached to the actual claim itself . ###And you discussed it with that body of er people at local conference . 
133076:22	###It could worsen it . ###On the other hand erm if you 're looking at , obviously sometimes our members felt that there was a benefit , at least the employer was n't getting , was n't getting off the hook as far as the matter was concerned , the matter arising was concerned , and therefore he was left with a problem just the same as we were . 
133076:47	###It could worsen it . ###On the other hand erm if you 're looking at , obviously sometimes our members felt that there was a benefit , at least the employer was n't getting , was n't getting off the hook as far as the matter was concerned , the matter arising was concerned , and therefore he was left with a problem just the same as we were . 
133114:56	###Er fine , fine limits in the bores of the object er piece of work that he was doing . ###And a slight slip you know , had taken him half a thou over the bore . 
133169:63	###Well er I think some of my earliest memories are er dating to the First World War time when I was a boy and we lived in Street which er during the war , we made a shift to which was really the opposite side of the street . ###Yeah . 
133209:75	###In later years that , it was driven by an electric motor . ###But the shafting , of course it was driven off the shafting and we had l lathes and drilling machines . 
133238:19	###Mm . ###And he died in eighteen forty eight when my grandfather would be about probably eight year or nine year old I think . 
133243:17	###But first of all he served his time in the smithy at and he met his wife , my grandmother in which was quite , you can quite imagine , it was just a walk up over the hills and er he met her in and er they were married . ###She had been born in Edinburgh but only mad chance because I think that the family were only there a short time . 
133255:79	###And we have a bicycle which he made in the year eighteen seventy , that was before he had started business on his own and he had erm made it for a young solicitor in Galashiels and I believe it was used in a race from Galashiels from Place in Galashiels to the . ###Where five of these boneshakers or velocipedes took part . 
133264:87	###And of course blacksmiths still worked on the penny farthing bicycle . ###And I have lots of letters which I discovered about five years ago , which I thought were probably letters that my father had written it , Adam , because his name and my grandfather 's name were exactly the same . 
133268:19	###But wheels and these sort of things would be got from Coventry in , I think , the maker 's the , the same people who invented the , the safety bike . ###They were er these letters are to one of these firms . 
133301:17	###We then got the , the agency for Morris , which was a very popular car and erm we also got the agency for Austins , which er , it came about with father being interested in a hiring car , the Austin Twenty , he thought it was , it was the best that could be got . ###And he went into the main agent in Edinburgh and gave them an order for three of those , and of course , we did n't get them just right away because er probably we 'd have got the last one about a couple of years later in these days . 
133319:58	###I always had a sort of inclination towards buildings , architecture and that sort of thing . ###But being the son of my father , it was his aim to send me out to serve my time as an engineer . 
133337:8	###And this carried on , right on well practically until the second war . ###And er then we had a bit , there was a victory organization of the schools then . 
133360:58	###But er it 's so simple today when you realize the , the difference , how easy it is and but er that was an experience I can tell you . ###Can you possibly remember how much you were paid for your apprenticeship with Amos ? 
133369:10	###And er your working week was what ? ###Well erm eight o' clock in the morning till quarter to six I think it was then in the evening . 
133382:7	###Er but as I say , I was n't very long at that so er when I came back to the , the motor trade , and bicycle trade , motor trade , cars in these days you get a variety of er all sorts of cars . ###Some of them were some had got old cars in where the tyres , if it was a puncture it was these great big wheels with beaded edge tyres which you can , you put on in quite a different way from the modern car tyres . 
133385:34	###Er then of course er petrol , before that I was in the , before I started the work we used to go out delivering petrol and petrol was all done in tins , two gallon tins . ###There was no petrol pumps . 
133389:15	###And each of the places er where we got the supply of tins , er we had a little van that went out to deliver the tins and we delighted as boys , going out , carrying the two tins er into the place . ###And er the cars then of course were all painted in , there were no cellulose paint , we had a paint shop there but er it , and we had an old painter who used to paint the cars in enamel and they were an awful lot of work on them . 
133391:15	###And of course you had to have great dustsheets to keep the dust . ###Because if it had been painted , and the paint took quite a long time to dry and er if there was a speck of dust it remained there forever . 
133395:7	###And there was a lot of rubbing down and that sort of thing . ###After the cellulose paint came in of course , things were quite different . 
133421:104	###He , it was for the , you know , the , the instructor w would come round and see if you had aimed the thing , it was a tripod sort of thing . ###Now orders came from and Sons the printers who were great target printers , and are still today the great target printer . 
133432:74	###But we got into a train there and went to , to Crewe I think it was . ###And then there was a certain place where we would go to a breakfast on the train . 
133434:53	###Then he landed in Oxford just at the right time to go out to the factory and it was open , and you had to get your car as soon as you could and see that everything was all right . ###And erm if you noticed anything , get it done before you left the works you see . 
133434:99	###Then he landed in Oxford just at the right time to go out to the factory and it was open , and you had to get your car as soon as you could and see that everything was all right . ###And erm if you noticed anything , get it done before you left the works you see . 
133465:18	###Er we went through just after it , the rest of the troops had gone through , we followed them on . ###And then we were held up at a place because some of our tanks e e the seventy ninth armoured division was er holding all the special tanks er which were flamethrowers and flails and all these sort of things . 
133487:56	###So that was er and then I came back here I was demobbed and came back to , I was er the highest rank I had was corporal you know , in the acting corporal actually . ###Er in er when we were in Germany . 
133517:60	###The there , a lot had , we had never made the small ones before . ###But we st started making them and er we made thousands during the war and of course part of the , the lower part of the garage was used for making these . 
133521:30	###And er we did this er in this little factory at Netherdale . ###But there was periods that y your men you , you had n't enough to occupy fully occupy the men . 
133528:54	###And we had an inspector from the , the office from the home department here who er e had his office down there , and we did all this , they were for er the Ministry of Works . ###And they , they did erm vehicles for the Navy , the Army , the Air Force and the Forestry Commission , any government thing that was . 
133549:27	###The , the fare for er that I went was thirty two pounds ten . ###And that was er I did n't come back with an Line boat , I came back with a erm Canadian Pacific Boat . 
133606:20	###And of course er w wondered if this Land Rover would go up there with the four wheel drive . ###So Mr went up and er he went a way up the hill , places that never a car or anything like that had been before because there were gullies and everything and he could have sank in the middle of a gully or something . 
133651:37	###Mm . ###But it , it was so varied that you went through the , the cities and the highland scenes where they went through the highlands and in the country and then you ended up with coming on to a crossroads in a modern , a futuristic city , where if you look down you , the pavements were elevated and you walked down to where all the models of General Motors were displayed as if they were crossing roads . 
133694:16	###It was a three year appointment . ###I was the first president of the gathering . 
133707:29	###Going back to your ###erm er council experience , erm what er you said that you were first put on the parks and recreation department . 
133722:36	###Well we began to tackle the housing problem because this was a very big problem . ###And the result was of course that we could n't build the centre of the town . 
133725:61	###And er some of the schemes have been criticized but it was a blessing in a way that we got them done when we did and er we were able to house a lot of people out there and release ground in the centre of the town to be redeveloped and er brought up to modern standards . ###Mhm . 
133742:23	###And Galashiels being placed where it was on the between four counties , th you had Berwickshire , Peebleshire , Roxburghshire and Selkirkshire all having a part . ###But Roxburghshire and Berwickshire came out of it and it was a Peebleshire and Selkirkshire home . 
133760:54	###They just , the early sixties I would say probably sixty two or sixty three when they , they came I think . ###And er of course we took away all the iron beds , put wooden beds , we put little wardrobes in the rooms and these thi tackling it bit by bit each year you see . 
133982:59	###And they , they will give you things like this and say , find the inverse function . ###Yeah . 
134055:18	###Does n't matter which one . ###It does n't matter which one . 
134137:7	###Er what 's the other thing that 's likely to happen , around a discontinuity ? ###Something that you mentioned earlier . 
134212:13	###Yeah . ###Even if it does n't mean anything 
134212:36	###Yeah . ###Even if it does n't mean anything 
134248:13	###a mapping is , you start off with one set , and you have another set . ###Mhm . 
134357:75	###Yeah . ###There are things that I have thought to myself about these . 
134426:9	###But the rules work very nicely . ###But they do n't work for zero . 
134489:88	###And then there 's the other rule , i is it valid within the rules of maths ? ###And when you come up against it , division by zero , it 's not . 
134683:69	###Alright ? ###Yes . 
134697:7	###Okay . ###Now if you got five , where did that come from . 
134698:34	###Now if you got five , where did that come from . ###What must I have given you ? 
134704:27	###Mm . ###where did that come from ? 
134710:12	###Alright ? ###Mm . 
134710:38	###Alright ? ###Mm . 
134785:47	###I meant ###I mean , we do n't like saying , we ca n't do it , in maths . 
134789:14	###And there are n't many ###Mm . 
134837:36	###But that 's , that 's , that 's all the square root of minus one is . ###Mm . 
134863:10	###Because algebra is letters , and if you have got er something which is you need a root of it or , you can do it with a number , you ca n't do it with a letter . ###Mm . 
134952:12	###X . ###Okay ? 
134962:21	###If it is , is it many-one , one-many ? ###Mm . 
135108:13	###Mm . ###And what 's the inverse mapping ? 
135157:34	###Because I 've had ###Well the worry 's not gonna help . 
135230:40	###Two times two is four , two times three is six . ###Now that did n't benefit me at all . 
135249:21	###So I 'm concerned , what effect am I gonna have on his future ? ###And she 's , well the effect that you 're gonna put on him , is probably better than what the , the others that are sitting the S A T S course . 
135250:46	###And she 's , well the effect that you 're gonna put on him , is probably better than what the , the others that are sitting the S A T S course . ###At some time , you 'll have to come back into some sort of a system like G C S Es if , if they 're , I mean they might be changed , but there 'll be something like 
135274:12	###game . ###Mm . 
135326:66	###Can you do additions , ###He can do addition and he can do take-aways , and he 's pretty , he 's not so bad with them but I think what it is , is basically they 're cramming them now . 
135585:12	###So you 're just doing one ###Er you 've got to work these out . 
135735:77	###What we 're go interested in is can you tell us anything about how , how you came to get the job at first . ###Was it because you knew somebody in the factory or was it the wages that attracted you ? 
135738:9	###Mm . ###they did n't employ married women . 
135828:56	###as things cropped up at the time she just showed me how to do it , and I just picked it from there . ###And is it a big section ? 
135864:12	###to it . ###Mhm . 
135875:157	###Er weaving it . ###They do n't think of us sorting , they just say , oh the pickers 'll get it . 
135883:74	###Mhm , so there 's quite a bit of joking goes on between sections about this and . ###Mhm , oh aye , mhm . 
135896:41	###I 'd have been , I did n't like the school , I did n't , ###Aha . 
135953:7	###Mhm . ###But it is n't really . 
136016:7	###No ? ###no . 
136048:101	###Mhm . ###And it made everybody was getting shifted down to , so I did n't fancy working down there , we 'd heard that much about it so that 's when I left and went to Walkers . 
136129:58	###It 's not , you 've got to be clever with your hands in most of these ###Aye . 
136132:9	###Do you get any particular kind of ailments working sore fingers and sore back ? ###Aye , sore fingers , hard , you get hard where you 're cutting all the time in the shape , but apart from that , maybe scissors fall that on your foot and 
136233:10	###Er , fulltime , I mean the students here they do n't count really . ###Who 's the youngest ? 
136236:12	###I think Caroline 's about the youngest . ###Mhm . 
136266:15	###Mhm . ###Where is it you 're from ? 
136543:245	###When we started here it looked er but we 'll only get actually six weeks , said you 've got six weeks work , that 's all . ###Mhm . 
136543:252	###When we started here it looked er but we 'll only get actually six weeks , said you 've got six weeks work , that 's all . ###Mhm . 
136593:10	###And do a lot of people go abroad now do you think from the factory ? ###Mhm , mhm . 
136618:55	###I mean before you used to have your own , your own , like the job I 'm , I was started for I 've got sweep all the floor , the place where we work . ###Mhm . 
136648:83	###Well basically I see we get less holidays than every other factory . ###Mm . 
136688:24	###Aye . ###Mhm . 
136692:7	###Mhm . ###It 's just things like that just 
136701:20	###They only will stand for the same , I do n't think they 're going to stand for the same conditions ###Mhm . 
136800:7	###my daughter travels up and down to Glasgow cos she did n't want to stay , she wanted to be at home , ###Mhm . 
136803:15	###And , and all these tests and they 've a project here and this , that and the other ###Mhm . 
136861:9	###Mhm . ###Now the there 's only twenty eight , thirty cos we we we 've a much smaller market . 
136930:13	###Mhm , mhm . ###, aha , just basically I mean how do you find working and , you know rearing children , bringing up a family , and doing your housework , do you , how do you organize it , do you find that you get up early and do work in the morning , will you do a bit of work when you go home or , does your partner help out with the work ? 
137047:82	###That 's right , aha . ###Instead of just , going to Tescos for some groceries or 
137118:48	###a deputy . ###Aha . 
137143:39	###That 's why when I hear my daughter talking about getting fifteen or twenty K a year I 'm going it would pay me two or three years for God 's sake . ###You can look after me then . 
137234:4	###Mhm , the women do n't have any clubs then ? ###Och no , we ca n't have that , you 'll 
137371:37	###What do feel about the changeover to non union and these new committees that they 've now set up ? ###Is it a big difference or ? 
137501:12	###So that 's ###feel that 's , that 's maybe a good thing ? 
137743:10	###Aye , you did . ###You 're not letting us know anyway . 
137744:8	###You 're not letting us know anyway . ###Oh you must have some nicknames for the bosses . 
137769:52	###Do you see improvement on ###I do n't think so . 
137905:8	###The right time . ###How many times have I had someone come and say , can you sign this drawing please 
137922:27	###That is the time for there to be nothing wrong with our drawings . ###Drawings can be blamed when er there is actually nothing wrong and people are looking for an excuse blame from themselves . 
137947:23	###There 's PICAS involved , works office involved , to a lesser extent B E S . ###So that is really where a weakness is , it 's in perceiving the needs of other parts , parts of the group . 
138008:7	###We need to have something better , or something different . ###So this is the first problem where w we , we talk about the management of quality . 
138012:14	###It would have been nice actually if somebody had said , we 're not going to have quality management , we 're going to have uck management . ###Or something like that , then we could have of , we could have redefined this , this new word and we would n't have had these awful confusions that we get . 
138070:46	###Because if you define requirements in an ivory tower and you do n't talk to the client , you 're gonna produce something which is n't exactly what they necessarily want . ###Now somebody very very er cleverly brought up the word client perception and in fact we h were given the definition earlier from Hughie 's notes , of meeting and exceeding customer expectations . 
138071:9	###Now somebody very very er cleverly brought up the word client perception and in fact we h were given the definition earlier from Hughie 's notes , of meeting and exceeding customer expectations . ###But if we are going to meet expectations of clients then really we have to know exactly what it is the client needs and would be happy with . 
138072:20	###But if we are going to meet expectations of clients then really we have to know exactly what it is the client needs and would be happy with . ###And we have to specify internally to us what will meet the client needs and even just exceed the client needs . 
138098:15	###We 've got an excellent result at the end of the day , but what 's the point of having an excellent result if we 're bankrupt next week ? ###And what does it tell us about our management ? 
138101:47	###I mentioned earlier the quick , slick jobs . ###We ca n't put all the bells and whistles , and all the , the checks and all the consultations and design reviews onto a job which gives us a fee income of er two thousand pounds . 
138121:9	###You know all those scrapey marks on multistorey car parks ? ###They 're all made by big cars . 
138158:117	###But anyway w w we 're on board with the the general ###thing which is important . 
138248:31	###We get paid and promoted for rushing round and solving problems wh that we 've created for ourselves . ###Do n't we ? 
138265:7	###Anyway erm occasionally they will inflict upon the group a German person or a Swiss national . ###And when we give the people syndicate or group exercises to do , the group with the Swiss person or German person in it is subjected to , now what is it we are supposed to be doing now ? 
138266:7	###And when we give the people syndicate or group exercises to do , the group with the Swiss person or German person in it is subjected to , now what is it we are supposed to be doing now ? ###We must write down the objectives of this exercise . 
138323:7	###It 's the other way round . ###Yes . 
138438:20	###Our quality system , like any other , has two interrelated aspects . ###They are our clients needs and expectations and our own needs and expectation and i interests . 
138439:22	###They are our clients needs and expectations and our own needs and expectation and i interests . ###As a service organization , we must continually meet the needs and expectations of our clients and in the most economic way . 
138439:64	###They are our clients needs and expectations and our own needs and expectation and i interests . ###As a service organization , we must continually meet the needs and expectations of our clients and in the most economic way . 
138499:7	###Q S P Six er gives generic job descriptions and sets down broad responsibility statements relating to quality and safety . ###Q S P Seven , project quality plans , we are going to be talking about in great detail after the after coffee , and also through your playtime at lunchtime . 
138540:31	###Yes . ###We 're , we 're currently running about fifteen minutes late . 
138585:17	###How to hire a car . ###We 've got various procedures within the group management procedures . 
138616:88	###And passed me the shovel . ###Er i it was insulting to you and I apologize for that . 
138655:10	###I think actually Trev that was very very timely , cos that really sort of encapsulated what we said this morning , so thank you very much for coming back . ###Er 
138797:30	###fill ours out . ###Specification . 
138861:55	###But we need ? ###Yeah . 
138907:7	###But if that 's hours ###Seems a seems a lot . 
138919:15	###are these DOPACS units then ? ###Yeah . 
139088:88	###Okay . ###Erm on the er process check list , erm a difference from ourselves which does the affect the price of group three , which we purposefully left out , they have quoted er a price for a soils investigation . 
139166:62	###Erm works , bridges , B E S subjects , as John rightly said , we missed out erm one or two of these and tended to ignore the things that were under works , bridges and B E S . ###Er and as John said , one or two of them were probably relevant and we did n't make er notes on those . 
139173:70	###What really we thought was the idea of this to pin them down into er in who was doing it and when . ###Er and we thought that there should have been initials against every item that was ticked . 
139174:97	###Er and we thought that there should have been initials against every item that was ticked . ###Erm t just to er well there was a l a certain lack of time on this thing , I mean , Dennis had to come round and tell us to start our tick-list else we were n't gonna . 
139207:15	###Er and so what John 's done , he 's suggested that in fact if it comes for March ninety four , that he spread the work out till nineteen ninety four which may be the sensible attitude cos people can make those decisions of the schemes to involved . ###If you do the work early somebody changes their mind as soon as you 've finished . 
139269:14	###And it might be that what we 've got to do is t is to change that to perhaps include P Way . ###I think we need a bit more discussion on this . 
139274:18	###Erm clearly state any exclusions erm er the moving , diverting the footpath for example . ###Clearly state that , we 're assuming that you are going to divide er divert the footpath , we 're not going to to . 
139274:74	###Erm clearly state any exclusions erm er the moving , diverting the footpath for example . ###Clearly state that , we 're assuming that you are going to divide er divert the footpath , we 're not going to to . 
139308:13	###Erm self-checking , as we mentioned before , self-checking i is permiss permissible . ###Er if you 've got a competent p person that you trust preparing the estimate , they can check it themselves . 
139308:44	###Erm self-checking , as we mentioned before , self-checking i is permiss permissible . ###Er if you 've got a competent p person that you trust preparing the estimate , they can check it themselves . 
139435:13	###If he signs it that indicates that he has accepted what you 've jointly agreed , and then you 've got something , a milestone , something to go back and measure yourselves against and to justify what you 've done against erm the fees that , that you 're invoicing the client for , if the client at s at some stage decides perhaps that 's not really what he wanted after all . ###Er in a competitive situation , the Rickmansworth tender w w w was a , a an example of that , we actually had a contract document which is about as thick and complicated as one of the contract documents that we would put out for civil engineering physical work to er er a contractor . 
139495:74	###Er a a and then say , well we can take that on board for you if you like but it might be more efficient for you to do the possessions because the civil engineer Leeds , actually is part of your organization a a and it might be more appropriate for you to get those possessions in , for you to decide whether or not you want one big bang o o o of a week 's possession or , or you want to do it i in four hour no-trains periods for the next three years . ###That type of putting back into a business context , is something which er we need to help the business come to terms with while they are growing in this new scheme of procuring work in a more formal and structured way . 
139509:75	###Granville emphasized just a few minutes ago , anything to do with the quality system is not a Moses job . ###It 's not tablets of stone which have been brought down from Mount Sinai forever to remain unalterable . 
139511:117	###It 's a living system , it 's designed to help you , if it 's not supporting and helping you then it must be changed . ###I now want to talk about two or three of the mechanisms and techniques we hope to be able to use in implementing changes when things are n't necessarily to your liking . 
139511:133	###It 's a living system , it 's designed to help you , if it 's not supporting and helping you then it must be changed . ###I now want to talk about two or three of the mechanisms and techniques we hope to be able to use in implementing changes when things are n't necessarily to your liking . 
139512:84	###I now want to talk about two or three of the mechanisms and techniques we hope to be able to use in implementing changes when things are n't necessarily to your liking . ###I will add a cautionary comment however , and say that you wo n't necessarily be able to change absolutely everything , at any time of the day or night , because there are some base requirements we have to address and we have to meet . 
139521:41	###But what it 's actually doing is prompting management to think . ###Shall we have a documented work instruction for this activity or not ? 
139631:25	###Oh yes . ###sorry , I thought mine was a copy , but it 's not . 
139667:26	###N n no comment , I think it 's all fairly self-explanatory . ###So I 
139771:8	###And the County presented erm a , a range of options . ###Mhm . 
139804:16	###The problem , Mr Chairman , is that after they 've got them into the authority , they 'll forget all about us again . ###Yes , I 
139804:39	###The problem , Mr Chairman , is that after they 've got them into the authority , they 'll forget all about us again . ###Yes , I 
139841:217	###I think that 's ###That was Mr . 
139870:13	###I 've been to one ###Is there anyone who 's prepared to represent Southwell ? 
139921:10	###Not so that it would stop cars getting across into the car park , but it would nevertheless give the impression . ###So it would slow traffic down basically 
139944:12	###Twenty six thousand pounds available . ###And it was suggested by the er two officers that were present , that that could , that money that 's already there , could in fact get a third of the scheme done , the third which was the bisecting little path , the main trees across the front , and the bit of the paving that takes you over to the North Road . 
139992:54	###Well ###would assume . 
140013:100	###Not as a permanent feature , no no , I think that the er the ###But the other scheme did at least indicate where the stalls would be , taken that into account . 
140080:7	###they , they 're not going to be allowed to go down there . ###M my concern is one of safety . 
140090:10	###Can I just say then that I think either it 's got to be blocked completely so they ca n't jump over the bridge , or it 's got to be unblocked . ###And I 'd say it was better to unblock , because the kids all walk over that bridge now , they 're eroding away the bank , the . 
140111:45	###Now whatever you do by opening up this ###it 's got to be done for safety purposes , please , for the infants . 
140136:10	###And at the same time improve the water supply situation there , by providing some standpipes so that our groundsmen can water a number of the er various facilities down there . ###And we had an er er an estimate , erm er which was circulated , which we accepted . 
140153:22	###But we 've increased the capacity of that pipe , so that if we have some more money eventually , we can er replace the final five yards from our meter to the Severn Trent water main er in some future years , to improve the pressure problems down the whole pipeline . ###So I th I hope that 's a full report to you . 
140153:39	###But we 've increased the capacity of that pipe , so that if we have some more money eventually , we can er replace the final five yards from our meter to the Severn Trent water main er in some future years , to improve the pressure problems down the whole pipeline . ###So I th I hope that 's a full report to you . 
140181:47	###We had a number of erm er items on this . ###We have significant expenditure erm in line on this . 
140183:20	###We budgeted a thousand pounds , it looks as if we 're going to have to spend more on urgent work . ###We 've now had a letter from Simon , as you asked us to get , on the trees and recreation ground , saying that , yes indeed , he says he now points out that there are dangers in the willow tree and also the dead Leylandi erm behind the children 's play area , and also some of the dead wood which we 've already identified . 
140201:52	###That 's my opinion . ###Yes , but they 
140214:47	###Yes we do . ###And that the main problem is those councillors who are concerned about it , and 
140273:74	###In order to help us I think in our discussions , it seems to me that , I think we ought to write formally to the County Council and to the District Council actually asking them for more details of their consideration for what they intend to do about parishes . ###Now we 've been to these meetings , and there 's a lot of airy-fairy words about yes we support parishes . 
140306:17	###Also , the roof is leaking in several places , there are cracks appearing on the parapet , which need , even to my eyes , need to be filled . ###Erm , what I 've done is I 've asked for quotes from three companies er to see how much work , how much it 'll cost us to take this action . 
140412:131	###We 've had a reply from the County Council erm we have , we have had erm erm a reply , they will be doing er a survey on Road to see if it i wants inclusion . ###They say that the stop signs , the visibility is n't erm again , he 's going to s to erm er he says that the stop signs , the visibility is n't bad enough , that the , the difficulties in visibility are n't bad enough , but he 's going to reexamine that particular situation . 
140437:20	###I should think it 's within sight of the police station anyway , I should think . ###I will raise that with erm . 
140500:46	###There is a rent review due next year , and I think they will be quite likely to ask you for additional rent , erm amount of rent per annum to you . ###But even saying that , if they doubled it to two hundred pounds , it 's a lot of years before we reach four thousand pounds . 
140516:37	###The position yeah , it 's as Roger said , and I think we 've got to the stage now where we 've shown good faith , we 've had that land put in good order , and we can now I think quite justifi justifiably say , we 've done enough , if you 're not prepared to help any more , it 's over to you . ###Cos at this point in time , we would have left that piece of ground in excellent condition . 
140572:50	###Right , well we that , that proposal , is there a seconder for that proposal ? ###No . 
140586:189	###Thank you . ###Erm maintenance of the Road football pitch , we 've had some complaints er on the er Road football pitch which relate to the er caravan access , erm caravan use , we 've also had some er comments from the Pub , saying that they actually appreciate the caravans being in the area because of the increased trade . 
140636:20	###It concerns me , in fact I was , I 've had a theory for a couple of years now , that what the Tories wish us all to do is to go on to the American system of medical insurance . ###Private health care . 
140644:41	###To tell what the Tories are doing to the N H S , I mean I do n't think it 's a case of us making them aware of what 's happening . ###They know what they 're doing to the N H S . 
140646:9	###I , come on I mean , if El Presidente Michael Heseltine , has to go all the way to Venice to have a heart attack . ###Because he 's very much aware of what the Tories are doing to the Health Service same as the rest of the cabinet . 
140776:88	###Erm basically to say that elsewhere can provide services on a cheaper basis than those hospitals erm wi with within London . ###I think the other point I would want to make is that it 's quite significant that in the week that we celebrate the forty fifth anniversary of the , the N H S , for the first time ever erm waiting lists within this country will have , will exceed one million . 
140804:7	###It 's vitally important that we mark the forty fifth anniversary of the N H S . ###Labour 's greatest ever achievement , without fear of any contradiction , the greatest achievement of the Labour movement was the introduction of the N H S which still remains to a large extent , the envy of the world . 
140805:7	###Labour 's greatest ever achievement , without fear of any contradiction , the greatest achievement of the Labour movement was the introduction of the N H S which still remains to a large extent , the envy of the world . ###We must fight to defend it . 
140806:7	###We must fight to defend it . ###We must resolve on the forty fifth anniversary to continue in our support . 
140816:7	###Sorry I nearly got a ticket as well . ###Nice welcome to . 
140990:7	###You can do all the specialities . ###I 'd go , I 'd do stars for . 
141104:17	###And if you can see Jeff after the meeting I 'm sure he , he can take your names and coordinate that . ###Thank you . 
141104:126	###And if you can see Jeff after the meeting I 'm sure he , he can take your names and coordinate that . ###Thank you . 
141136:41	###Did you get a job as soon as you left school ? ###Yeah . 
141296:51	###Why did they used to call him Sir ? ###Well he , he , he used to go to er used to go to the British Legion , every Sunday morning . 
141319:31	###Would n't gang up four onto one , five onto one , and , and mugging and noth nothing , none , none of that nonsense . ###How long wer were you actually at then ? 
141350:95	###And how , how did you get back into then ? ###Well er my mother went down the yard , I wo n't tell you about the other , sister . 
141386:79	###And the foreman er we used to play about , lark about , throw orange peel at each other you know , cos it were a boring job you just stand like this and you could more or less close your eyes , you know . ###After a while so to , to relieve the boredom we used to throw orange peel at each other , little bits you know , screw it up and , and one hit this bloke who was made foreman before , before he was made foreman a and we had a fight . 
141444:47	###Er then election day we were out all day with , with a driver of a car getting people out and for them or going through the motions . ###I 've looked after the kids for them while they 've gone to vote , anything to get them here , that was the thing . 
141544:12	###not myself , no . ###Were other people involved in with it ? 
141558:21	###You 'd got the tools and different things and show you how to use them . ###You , you paid for it . 
141680:74	###Er well I 'm not gonna mention their names now but er quite a few characters , believe me . ###Er I were telling you about the pianos , in one particular terrace you could just imagine it in , what , nineteen er twenty si no , twenty seven twenty eight , and you know things were bad , you talk about the thirties , the twenties were worse than that . 
141730:56	###He said , you 've copied , have n't you ? ###I said , no sir . 
141764:115	###And then we 'd tin-lurky er you , you , you 'd get a tin , you do n't , you know tin-lurky ? ###Go on , go on . 
141768:78	###You sort of released him to , to go and hide again . ###Er rounders which is er similar to er I dunno American baseball in , in a fashion is n't it ? 
141838:10	###Oh yeah . ###Well there was a it was such a job at that time you could n't get work and we , we used to genuinely look for work every day , but it was just a waste of time . 
141838:33	###Oh yeah . ###Well there was a it was such a job at that time you could n't get work and we , we used to genuinely look for work every day , but it was just a waste of time . 
141871:37	###I mean I , I , I , I 've had as many as a thousand marbles in a bag . ###All for taking lawyers . 
141909:7	###And he took me home , er he gave me a good talking to , and tell me dad , cos me , I nearly , I got a good hiding , was going to get a good hiding from me dad , until this policeman says , do n't worry , he says er , you wo n't hear anything about it . ###And I got a summons . 
142081:9	###It did n't bother me . ###I think most people were the same in those days . 
142093:89	###Yes . ###We did . 
142175:30	###Even the canary cover had an embroidery on it . ###It was amazing . 
142213:32	###Er there was n't anything like the , well not to the schools that I went to , the corporal punishment that there seems to have been since . ###Er it w I do n't ever remember anyone you know getting the cane or anything like that . 
142315:8	###Er even the headmaster said , he tried to put me off . ###He said , oh you know it 's very hard work . 
142329:41	###Er it was mainly lectures on erm hygiene , and biology , a and that type of thing . ###And er then we erm we , we , we went on the wards for about two or three hours a day and we just s sort of did what we were told , took out drinks and , and that sort of thing , and mouthwashes , and after er we 'd been there for about six or eight weeks we were allowed to wash patients , if , if they could n't wash themselves . 
142340:65	###Everything was er so much more difficult than it , than it is today and er things were not sort of disposed of like they are now . ###They , they were all sterilized , thoroughly washed , and then st sterilized in , in the sterilizer , boiled in the sterilizer . 
142349:31	###It was terribly badly cooked . ###And you just could not manage on the food that was provided . 
142351:18	###You either got tuck boxes from home or you had to supplement it with your own earnings , which , ten shillings a week . ###We got two pounds a month . 
142361:9	###There was never any time at all . ###And even when you got into your second years you did get erm two hours off one day and three hours the next , which was usually five till eight . 
142401:50	###And they 'd , they 'd come in for surgery and you know you 'd nurse them back again . ###Get them up on their feet . 
142402:80	###Get them up on their feet . ###And there was a satisfaction about it although I always think in those days we had to work so fast that there was n't the time to do what you 'd really like to have done for the patients . 
142403:7	###And there was a satisfaction about it although I always think in those days we had to work so fast that there was n't the time to do what you 'd really like to have done for the patients . ###It was a case of , I mean we used to start and wash them at three o' clock in the morning because t you had to start then because you 'd never get it all done . 
142406:14	###Er and if you did n't start at that early hour you 'd , you 'd , you 'd never , they used to get , sit up in bed , have a wash , then lie down again and go to sleep . ###I mean I do n't think they do , they do that these days , I hope not any rate . 
142419:9	###Er standards have gone up , there 's no doubt about that . ###But erm 
142447:31	###So we , we th that , that was er another good thing they , they got going but there was very little for , for nurses to do . ###I think you were sort of there to , and then you see you , you 've got to remember that all our lectures were taken in our off duty time . 
142448:53	###I think you were sort of there to , and then you see you , you 've got to remember that all our lectures were taken in our off duty time . ###We did n't have time off for lectures we had to fit them in with our wi with our off duty . 
142449:88	###We did n't have time off for lectures we had to fit them in with our wi with our off duty . ###Er and often you 'd come off duty at eight o' clock a and you 'd have to go to a lecture between eight and nine at night . 
142454:16	###She was very good . ###Very . 
142460:86	###But we did get terribly tired . ###And we had one day off a month . 
142460:118	###But we did get terribly tired . ###And we had one day off a month . 
142465:65	###I su I suppose erm things are easier now . ###And of course nowadays there 's so much er things that er we use , there are so much labour saving things now that which makes a big difference . 
142476:7	###Er er the way we looked . ###We , we were not allowed to look er pretty on the wards or anything like that . 
142479:56	###We were not there to look pretty at all . ###Er and er you , yes she was very very particular . 
142480:46	###Er and er you , yes she was very very particular . ###We were not allowed to have any ladders in our stockings or anything like that , we had to look very smart . 
142481:45	###We were not allowed to have any ladders in our stockings or anything like that , we had to look very smart . ###Er and always always clean and in those , even when you were , you had to behave yourself when you were not on duty when you were , even if you , she saw you out not looking er smart she 'd soon tell you about it , er , no you let the hospital down when you , you 're like that . 
142482:64	###Er and always always clean and in those , even when you were , you had to behave yourself when you were not on duty when you were , even if you , she saw you out not looking er smart she 'd soon tell you about it , er , no you let the hospital down when you , you 're like that . ###And we were never allowed to go out in uniform , we always had to change er into mufti . 
142487:24	###They 'd got to sit up and lean against their pillows and their sheets had got to be turned down . ###Er very , very neat , very tidy . 
142491:34	###And she 'd go round and sort of s say , good morning , good morning . ###Er very prim and proper , and and er er she 'd go all the way round and she 'd soon tell you if there was , if the beds were n't tidy . 
142514:17	###And I do n't know wh I mean it was ridiculous even in those days , ten o' clock was very early . ###But er no you were n't allowed out . 
142515:47	###But er no you were n't allowed out . ###And even then er you had to ask for permission to stay out till ten . 
142522:21	###You were there for four years and the they , they did n't just , if you were n't in by ten and you did n't get your proper night 's sleep then you would n't be any good on the wards the next morning . ###That was their er the their way of looking at it . 
142523:16	###That was their er the their way of looking at it . ###Er that you , you had to have your sleep otherwise you were , you were n't er you , you could n't a attend to your lectures and , and do your work the next day . 
142525:163	###You had , you had to get your night 's sleep and proper rest . ###Do you think that was an attitude to that was erm unique to nursing at the time or do you think erm that possibly girls in other walks of life had the same kind of experience of discipline and demands on them ? 
142549:41	###Four years ###Four years . 
142565:76	###Yes you did you , you , you erm you , you were sort of treated differently , yes you were definitely . ###Did you get er different privileges as , as you became the fully qualified nurse then ? 
142566:50	###Did you get er different privileges as , as you became the fully qualified nurse then ? ###Yes , y yes , you , you were , you 'd sort of passed all your exams so yo th they sort of had to make it a little bit easier . 
142567:50	###Yes , y yes , you , you were , you 'd sort of passed all your exams so yo th they sort of had to make it a little bit easier . ###You , you were allowed to , to stay out but erm you , you had to get permission . 
142583:62	###Er you were called out at night and of course in those days you went round on a bicycle and you , you went round with your little black bag strapped on the back . ###And you 'd , you 'd , you 'd be on call and the babies nearly always come at night . 
142589:64	###It was the practical side of it . ###But erm yes sometimes you 'd , you 'd get there in time but you see they 'd just , I , there , there were n't the telephones about in those days so you , you , you could n't , everybody did n't have a phone , they could n't ring in an and say I 'm in labour . 
142610:15	###And they 'll say , well yes there 's , there 's this bowl . ###And you 'd say , right , and you 'd go the , after the baby was born you , you 'd go back again to what we call the nur nursing , nursing up and you 'd want the bowl again for the baby and you 'd say wh where 's the bowl and they 'd say , oh well I think it 's downstairs , we used it yesterday to make a pudding in . 
142611:17	###And you 'd say , right , and you 'd go the , after the baby was born you , you 'd go back again to what we call the nur nursing , nursing up and you 'd want the bowl again for the baby and you 'd say wh where 's the bowl and they 'd say , oh well I think it 's downstairs , we used it yesterday to make a pudding in . ###And so you 'd have to go and find this bowl and sterilize it again . 
142616:18	###And that would more or less sterilize it , as sterilized as you 'd , you know , you could ever get anything . ###You see there was no erm grants in those days like they have now , nothing , nothing at all . 
142630:105	###And er who were the midwives employed by ? ###Er the County Council . 
142634:7	###I did n't sort of erm I cer I , I certainly did n't touch you know any , any money at all . ###And when you were a student erm who was paying for your training ? 
142636:64	###We had to pay for our own training in those days . ###Yes . 
142709:10	###No it was erm I was going to say much more natural in , in those days , I suppose in a way it was more natural . ###I do n't think the babies were any worse or the mothers were any worse . 
142712:41	###I mean it was n't done , and nobody knew about it , and no one said anything about it but it was . ###Were there any anaesthetics in use during childbirth ? 
142724:12	###Er clean , er th they were nearly always clean but there was just not er the things there to use . ###That was the trouble , they just could n't afford to provide them . 
142772:38	###not really . ###But I mean often women would say , what can I do , I do n't want any more babies , what can I do ? 
142809:18	###They 'd have the ten o' clock feed and then it , it 'd sleep through till , till the six o' clock the next morning for the next morning feed . ###That 's what you 'd try to train him to do . 
142811:12	###Er but usually you 'd have to give perhaps a drink of erm er water just , just warm water . ###Er just in the middle of the night . 
142811:34	###Er but usually you 'd have to give perhaps a drink of erm er water just , just warm water . ###Er just in the middle of the night . 
142891:71	###We , we perhaps would have a week or ten days in between cases . ###And then of course we could go out and er as much as we liked then . 
142904:65	###So were the , the people in the other bed-sits also nurses like yourself ? ###Yes , they were . 
142930:17	###Erm not unless there was a reason for it . ###You know if there were no children then probably th th they would , they might do then . 
142934:72	###Sort of left school . ###Er they night go back to it then if they really wanted to , or usually there was a reason for it . 
143003:40	###Yes , we did . ###We had a little erm er house up in Grove , just er on the er edge of Park . 
143008:34	###Well we lived there er yes the whole , whole time , all our married life . ###He did move away for a while er and had er workrooms away from the , from the house and I just ran the , the shop . 
143010:21	###But erm when I lost my sight then he had to close that down and come back so we were all under one roof again . ###Mm . 
143011:32	###Mm . ###Where was it that you had to move from during the War ? 
143011:50	###Mm . ###Where was it that you had to move from during the War ? 
143019:30	###Did he go into the army ? ###No , he did n't go into the army . 
143050:31	###But it was very difficult for these for young , young couples with the er er men at the front and perhaps they 'd only just got married before the war and it was very hard lines on them . ###I often think er and then of course you see if , if they er the airmen , their wives used to try and get er digs near where the aerodromes were so they could see their menfolk . 
143060:60	###But er we , we did n't have any really bad air attacks at all . ###We were very fortunate but I do remember the guns used to go off and I , when my so my son was born the , the guns were going off all the time from the castle . 
143288:19	###Mhm . ###and I do n't feel the same for off of that . 
143290:12	###I feel as if I have to use my spray more . ###I seemed right doing , alright drying my feet now and not my . 
143308:15	###Sometimes I did n't even need it at all I could walk about shopping and everything . ###Aha . 
143661:12	###Thank you very much . ###What happened was that it was the son and I could n't get he was given and he 's never had it in his life . 
143683:33	###it should have been a hundred or something . ###Mm . 
144073:15	###er it was my stomach . ###Mhm . 
144125:55	###Aye . ###Well that 's why you 're to take that as soon as you get , as soon as you start morning . 
144237:20	###Oh you 're obviously on call . ###Right . 
144448:17	###The right one they say but the left one is ###Too much . 
144638:57	###Mhm . ###and he 's given me pills and that for it , but it 's my ears . 
144710:26	###Aye . ###Right . 
144767:12	###Mhm . ###for a job and I 'm just , that would be another 
145893:12	###Right . ###Right Carol ? 
146150:7	###That 's right . ###Aye . 
146407:9	###when this started . ###Yeah . 
146410:32	###Aye . ###Impetigo is n't nearly as easy to pass on as chicken pox . 
146474:34	###In your sleep . ###That 's right . 
146744:62	###But obviously that 'll take a little bit of time through discussion wo n't it ? ###Yes it will , yeah . 
146883:11	###Erm and I mean I 've had a recent bereavement , I mean I , I lost my mum at Christmas and got three days leave . ###Mm . 
146972:58	###Right the of the reason is in ###yeah . 
146999:61	###Yeah ? ###Yeah . 
146999:95	###Yeah ? ###Yeah . 
147071:39	###But again it 's , it 's another one of these things that makes it really complicated . ###It does . 
147111:12	###Erm ###Mhm . 
147145:11	###Yeah , and I do n't now but i I mean I 'm certainly in two I 've been since there 's people who 've referred to the fact that they do n't have those members of staff working for them at the optimum days , ###Mm . 
147255:9	###That 's right , yeah . ###Yeah , I think so . 
147262:107	###Yeah . ###So 
147268:18	###That 's right . ###Yeah . 
147433:35	###Yeah , yeah . ###and so on . 
147537:14	###Right well , well we will finish by two thirty then wo n't we ? ###yeah . 
147592:10	###Yeah . ###we 're working with or not that might be our funding ratios . 
147624:15	###Yeah . ###Erm and it is n't going to add anything to anybody else about from 
147707:68	###Yeah . ###that 's theoretically simple hard data . 
147718:96	###Erm in terms of numbers ? ###Yeah . 
147727:67	###So there 's no case there 's no re no numbers . ###Well is n't there ? 
147727:85	###So there 's no case there 's no re no numbers . ###Well is n't there ? 
147764:37	###no I just do n't want to exclude anything ###No . 
147789:55	###Yeah . ###what their people 's cases are . 
147809:47	###So we , so we distribute the staff based on the hard data and then you make cases based on other factors . ###Yeah . 
147816:37	###everybody makes the same case ###Yeah . 
147840:84	###Economy to scale is another one , Deborah , you need a minimum number of staff erm to service a location . ###Yeah . 
147913:9	###you know the , the supplementary debate items ###Mm . 
147919:26	###And they 'd only be significant if we were expecting a significant disproportion anyway ###Yeah . 
147954:9	###Mm . ###The way the standards require it to be we need the following numbers of staff . 
147983:22	###Mm . ###not because that 's the best day for them to be in to do their work , er it 's not , erm but because that 's when the meeting is . 
147985:28	###Yeah well we had , we had to abandon that , we brou we brought all our Employment Officers in on a Friday , erm and we just could n't staff the office the rest of the week you see ###Yeah I know . 
147993:24	###Mm . ###it ? 
148015:4	###Th they 're building up flexitime which ###Yeah . 
148066:27	###It 's really strange is n't it ? ###Mm . 
148132:39	###Oh here it is . ###The second bid issue is the careers service branch development fund which is the one that 's available every year , but we originally had Jane ' s project , the F E project and so , erm now this year the bids have been asked to be on certain subject areas . 
148151:10	###Mm . ###implementing that than something that was a little bit more innovative . 
148190:159	###Just nod in agreement . ###Yeah . 
148191:17	###Yeah . ###So you know , nothing might come of that but if it does erm I would be very keen to actually er the , the plan was to second a member of C S M T for six months to do it , and I would be very keen to do it I must admit . 
148292:19	###And obviously it 'll be very dependent on how much money we 've got as to what our stavin staffing establishment will be . ###Mm mm . 
148397:7	###I told Keith about that . ###office in Easingwold as well . 
148437:53	###half an hour . ###Yeah . 
148459:20	###No Cynthia said that last line did n't she ? ###No she said that that 's why last line of yeah . 
148547:14	###Yeah the other thing on staffing tt which is a related , but in a sense I 'm trying to keep it as something of a separate issue , and that is to do with the amount of management time . ###I 've started to talk to Alan about what I see as a lack of , of management time erm in this division . 
148564:20	###And you see Paul wo n't be present at the , I do n't think Paul 'll be present at the meeting on the nineteenth , I think Alan will chair that . ###Right . 
148565:13	###Right . ###So that what we will have to do is make our recommendations to Paul the following day . 
148573:10	###I could just turn up and say , oh am I a day too early ? ###Shame to go back , I 'll stay today as well . 
148645:24	###Yeah , but they only pay for the first one . ###Yeah . 
148716:24	###which will really take a lot of time . ###Mm . 
148929:62	###Mm . ###There 's a lot of unknown at the moment 
148941:9	###Year nine now ###So he 'd just make it 
149000:16	###Mm . ###you know you send a form back that says we teach careers lessons , immediately you 're told , right you can stop doing that , that 's not your job to do that . 
149045:44	###well that 's where all rough grass and like erm like erm gorse bushes and ferns . ###Did that run down to the river ? 
149046:20	###Did that run down to the river ? ###Yes it did it run down to the river and we used to have to write to to get a permit to camp on there for the week but then there used to be an old , the old foreman of he used to come round every Saturday night , have you got your permit ? 
149087:22	###What the lessons you mean ? ###I mean they 'd , they 'd , I mean the lessons and if you done anything wrong well you get , you get the cane and anything else . 
149175:122	###Well my father was earning a good money . ###I mean women , men in the warehouse they were on about two guineas a week . 
149177:13	###Now my father was earning five pounds seven and six , twelve and six a week so there was a big difference in money were n't there and then you see be that list when they finished dredging he had to drop right back two pounds thirteen a week . ###What else did you do just as a cabin boy ? 
149182:132	###Well a chain locker is where all the spare chain used to like coil up ###So it came in and it went round 
149197:9	###Yeah you 'd lower that down . ###My father used to have what they call a lead line that used to be a wire with a all marked with feet and fathoms on and sound and 
149219:19	###Yes . ###where a chain would n't , that 'd wear a little bit but not too much . 
149220:7	###where a chain would n't , that 'd wear a little bit but not too much . ###So as a cabin boy you had to relieve 
149223:9	###Did they all have their own cabins ? ###Well they had one big long one , they did . 
149224:10	###Well they had one big long one , they did . ###And you had to clean 
149224:29	###Well they had one big long one , they did . ###And you had to clean 
149254:38	###That 's right , yeah . ###It 's a lot easier now is n't it ? 
149255:47	###It 's a lot easier now is n't it ? ###Oh it is a lot easier cos that all they have to do is run on , drop ' em come off again . 
149259:12	###You say pick your anchors up in an old boat ? ###Yes . 
149271:42	###Was n't that hard work ? ###That was hard work all the time , my hands my hands used to chap on the backs , used to chap hands and that was only , I was over the wind , I wind and , and er when I used to scrub the cabin out which was with washing soda and soft soap and when you went along cos that was you get , you get erm , ordinary washing soda on the back of your hands and they did n't supply anything then . 
149321:9	###With the oil in them unclear ###Yes . 
149331:239	###Yes . ###Was it your job to do that ? 
149333:11	###Well that was , that was the crew 's job you see cos you used to have , they used to be erm , they used to be the master of the ship , my father , and they would still have a mate , he 's dead and gone and there was myself one side on the starboard side on a winch and we had two men right aft on the after winch and they used to have to look after three chains . ###Cos you had a stern chain and two side chains . 
149348:80	###Yes . ###What was that to move her about ? 
149366:88	###This be about nineteen twenty nine . ###Wh why were they getting short of money ? 
149382:15	###So go going back to the dredging , did you eventually take over from your father on the dredger ? ###No , no , my father he finished his dredging harbourmaster , and that 's when they finished dredging then . 
149389:37	###Put them up in a boat yeah . ###They used to , cos they 'd put a couple in the old anchor boat what we were n't using it , put a couple in there and they 'd tow ' em up to the dock . 
149393:9	###And they used to come up to the maintenance workshop ###maintenance workshop and be done , that used to be the job for the fitters and blacksmiths . 
149427:46	###From the point down to the stern of the boat and then there was a hole in there like that cut out of the wood . ###Just like your U shaped . 
149436:31	###What else did you get in trouble for ? ###Oh nothing else , no nothing else , well we dare n't because I mean my father was so strict , you know you gotta do as your told . 
149436:68	###What else did you get in trouble for ? ###Oh nothing else , no nothing else , well we dare n't because I mean my father was so strict , you know you gotta do as your told . 
149437:42	###Oh nothing else , no nothing else , well we dare n't because I mean my father was so strict , you know you gotta do as your told . ###On the dredger what other jobs would you have to do in the way of maintenance , you said you had to repair the buckets . 
149468:102	###Start dredging , see he wanted to get the job done . ###I know that on Sunday I was on , on the watch , this weekend , and there was so much ice on the river , our anchor boat which is all made of wood , that 's moored up alongside the dredger and when I went along and got , that was about twelve o' clock in the mid-day . 
149485:9	###See we had a fire right in the middle of the cabin and I used to chuck this here er flock mattress on the table and the blankets over the old flock pillow and go to sleep that way . ###What were you keeping watch for while you were on board ? 
149485:105	###See we had a fire right in the middle of the cabin and I used to chuck this here er flock mattress on the table and the blankets over the old flock pillow and go to sleep that way . ###What were you keeping watch for while you were on board ? 
149487:167	###Well we had to keep somebody on watch in case there was any damage , say the ship was up the river and a chain broke or they hit you , so you had to put your navigation lights up and to put navigation lights up we had hurricane lamps , we had a red and a white one , they should have been six foot apart , they never were they was about three foot . ###Why was that ? 
149489:41	###Well , that 's the quickest way to do it , we used to hang one below the other on the dredger , be put up at sunset and we used to take ' em down early in the morning , but you always had , you always had erm navigation lights up , must ###So this was part of the job at the weekend ? 
149645:95	###Right to the dock yes ###right the way through ? 
149648:140	###That 's when the erm , the pleasure boats used to run from there , the Suffolk and the Norfolk , them , they were erm , they were sharp both ends , the Suffolk and the Norfolk . ###Sharp both ends ? 
149683:75	###You talked about the New Cut ? ###Yes , well the New Cut , you see , years ago , they used to be the entrance to the dock . 
149684:71	###Yes , well the New Cut , you see , years ago , they used to be the entrance to the dock . ###Cos if you g if anybody go down there now they could see where what we call the Pier Head , so ships had to go up there and turn in to the lock gate . 
149688:9	###There were no lock , no lock gates this end . ###No , that 's a long while before my time . 
149695:7	###Yeah . ###Oh goodness knows , I mean that them gates have been renewed and I remember them being renewed , these gates what they got there now . 
149712:43	###And who used to work all this out , your father ? ###No , the Harbourmaster used to do that . 
149721:9	###And you did this with a three foot wide bucket ? ###Yes . 
149724:12	###Yes , surprising , it 's surprising how fa far you went ahead . ###I mean seven years continual dredging for seven years apart from a month they in dock and you were taking out eight hundred tonne every hopper load and some days you were doing five loads and sometimes four loads , was a lot of mud we dumped so much mud out at erm near the Cork Lightship , now you would think they would level theirself off would n't you and if they did n't that up . 
149724:24	###Yes , surprising , it 's surprising how fa far you went ahead . ###I mean seven years continual dredging for seven years apart from a month they in dock and you were taking out eight hundred tonne every hopper load and some days you were doing five loads and sometimes four loads , was a lot of mud we dumped so much mud out at erm near the Cork Lightship , now you would think they would level theirself off would n't you and if they did n't that up . 
149724:67	###Yes , surprising , it 's surprising how fa far you went ahead . ###I mean seven years continual dredging for seven years apart from a month they in dock and you were taking out eight hundred tonne every hopper load and some days you were doing five loads and sometimes four loads , was a lot of mud we dumped so much mud out at erm near the Cork Lightship , now you would think they would level theirself off would n't you and if they did n't that up . 
149735:152	###Yes . ###And you 've dredged up pieces of rock ? 
149772:137	###What happened to the bones and the teeth you you collected ? ###The teeth there used to be a man come down about once every three months and er where he came from I do n't know . 
149848:73	###I went crane driving . ###Mm mm what did that involve ? 
149876:104	###thirteen foot six , they got little short chains like a lot better . ###Did you get into trouble for breaking 
149877:8	###Did you get into trouble for breaking ###Trouble yeah , trouble I got put off for a fortnight , on the dole , then he , I was on the dole for a week and er he cos at that time you had to appear in front of the erm , what they call the Court of Referees at the Labour Exchange , that was their Committee . 
149882:30	###that one alright . ###Was it usual to be stood off if you did something wrong for the ? 
149886:97	###Ipswich Dock Commission coo dear . ###And they would generally stand you off work for a while , that was your punishment ? 
149886:120	###Ipswich Dock Commission coo dear . ###And they would generally stand you off work for a while , that was your punishment ? 
149887:8	###And they would generally stand you off work for a while , that was your punishment ? ###That 's punishment , yeah , they would either do that or there was one driver down there he broke a wheel , that were n't his fault , and he had to pay for it , he had to go in the office like I did once . 
149904:100	###I said yeah just started , course if I 'd have paid money off I said lived on it you see ###Mm 
149980:81	###You got it ? ###Yeah , we got it and another time you see , when we wer when we used to be crane drivers , when we first started crane driving , the job for a crane driver was to do anything , you were a crane driver but if your crane wanted painting you would paint it yourself , chip to paint it . 
149982:12	###If a docker , you got to help the dockers down the hold , if you ai n't got the crane driving to do , you had to go in the warehouse if there ai n't nothing to do . ###But course now the present day they do n't do none of that , they drive the crane and only the crane , they do n't even clean the crane . 
149983:9	###But course now the present day they do n't do none of that , they drive the crane and only the crane , they do n't even clean the crane . ###And you actually had to maintain your own 
149992:58	###Oh , I see . ###And red lead it and then used to be off the top of the jib . 
150002:45	###The end would come up and , and keep your load level on the ground you see , otherwise if you were a straight jib , they 'd come down and further you come down the further , the lower your load get . ###Oh that , that was a lovely crane . 
150016:57	###For food ? ###Yeah , they would , let the bake it we used to Danish foods and cos we used to have a Danish er , we used to have erm Polish ship come in one week and an English ship come in the next week and the , the bacon was just pigs were all killed , wrapped in sacking and tied with string , and they used to be laid in the hold like that . 
150040:17	###What they done , ooh they had one or two bags of that . ###Yeah . 
150049:22	###I was going to ask you about your crane driving , how long were you a crane driver ? ###Well I was a crane driver from nineteen thirty two till I went stevedoring , what time would that be , oh about nineteen fifty five I reckon . 
150057:18	###From the , from the pool , see there used to be a , there used to be a pool , near lock gates , that 's where they used to be . ###One time that used to be further in the dock and I used to be let the erm , the manager know , the pool manager , cos at one time before the war , dockers were erm casual and when the war started , then they thought theirself , right we 're gonna make er dockers more or less permanent , so they all come under the Ipswich Dock Commission then . 
150067:18	###They used to work say one week and have about a month off or go on the dole for a month . ###So then what happened was , did the Dock Commission say you ca n't have your own men any more ? 
150070:102	###Run by the Dock Commission ? ###Run by the Dock Commission . 
150072:49	###See the dockers then all got together and they said right so many men for that job , so many for that job and that did n't matter who they were , they had to their job , all the way round the dock . ###Whether they wanted to go on that job or not ? 
150125:11	###He 'd send them then , he every dock was numbered from one to hundred and thirty and he 'd say righto , number one so and so , number five so and so and of course when they come back to the pool , they 'd go on the end of the rota . ###See so after men finished they would , there 'd be a steady turnround all the time . 
150138:176	###In what way ? ###I had more responsibility . 
150150:9	###I mean , one time , for gear , then they do n't , we do n't make slice ropes at one time . ###They do n't slice ' em now . 
150151:8	###They do n't slice ' em now . ###And you had to that yourself ? 
150151:28	###They do n't slice ' em now . ###And you had to that yourself ? 
150163:7	###different parts of the world ? ###I used to , no I only went away on er , we only went to Rotterdam once , that 's all . 
150167:9	###Well they had one man in the hold and they used to have a fork lift in the hold , in Holland , with one man and he could do that job and they sent one man ashore , well over here we had four men in the hold and two men ashore . ###Well the dockers would n't have it here . 
150177:14	###Oh they changed on account of all containers you see . ###Yes . 
150315:9	###Well they used to send you , th they used to get the returns from your employer and then they 'd send you the demand note in , so then ###put that to one side did you ? 
150318:12	###Do you think anybody ever spent too much ###That was three pound fifteen shillings was n't it ? 
150336:10	###So tha tha at that time , I mean they might get as much as three pound for mooring one ship up . ###Really ? 
150338:18	###But that had to be shared between the number of men ###Exactly oh yes that was shared between the men what erm , there used to be two men so they 'd get er share the three pound between them or five pound whatever it was . 
150344:69	###I knew men old he was a chain smoker , he always used to smoke Woodbines and as one went out he 'd light the other one er ou on it , he would n't use matches , no he 'd , he 'd light one cigarette off the other . ###Would have been cheaper to have used matches . 
150344:98	###I knew men old he was a chain smoker , he always used to smoke Woodbines and as one went out he 'd light the other one er ou on it , he would n't use matches , no he 'd , he 'd light one cigarette off the other . ###Would have been cheaper to have used matches . 
150355:10	###They still , they still moor them though do they ? ###They s moor them but they 're employed by the Ipswich Port Authority , the boatmen , these other men were n't . 
150364:23	###tying them up but when they went out to the end of the estuary that was just a case of get there first to get the job ? ###Oh yes , I mean if they were going out to let go of the ropes . 
150384:172	###Oh it was yes , I mean y when you take now erm er a boatman , I mean , and he , he like today well they ring up , I mean today I know the Ipswich Port Authority they lay the phone on the houses and they pay for it for ' em ###Do they ? 
150391:52	###What years ago ? ###Mm 
150411:45	###Mm , were they on the dock ? ###And they were on the dock . 
150416:71	###Would you say it 's better ? ###Well I would say it 's , yes , better , cos mean with th with th these erm containers you see now I mean , we had about say ten years ago we had a man here he used to deal with the all general cargo , all loose cargo from Beirut and all the Mediterranean ports but course now you got the trouble there now that 's a , that 's a cargo that 's , what 's fell away . 
150417:11	###Well I would say it 's , yes , better , cos mean with th with th these erm containers you see now I mean , we had about say ten years ago we had a man here he used to deal with the all general cargo , all loose cargo from Beirut and all the Mediterranean ports but course now you got the trouble there now that 's a , that 's a cargo that 's , what 's fell away . ###Going back to the agents up in the town , the boatmen to get information about a ship coming in they would have to go up to the town 
150457:35	###They made them themselves or the wives did . ###Yeah , and it was their tradition was it that if one turned up with a dirty 
150515:9	###Now they get everything . ###That 's the truth that is . 
150516:8	###That 's the truth that is . ###So you had to buy your own stuff then ? 
150521:28	###Wooden pegs in your sole , they used to drill ' em and they used to put wooden , and them wooden pegs would n they 'd never come out , cos if you put nails in , the nails would rust . ###What was this because you were standing in water a lot ? 
150535:33	###further down the river then ? ###No sewage outfall is just the other side of the Power Station , that 's where it is . 
150595:21	###Oh it is an improvement , oh yes . ###Definite , I mean there 's not the sewage go in the river now , I do n't think anyway . 
150605:72	###When you were talking about your dredging earlier on , you used to take th the soil that you dredged up in the mud , in your dredger out t employ the hoppers out to sea . ###How did you dispose of it 
150618:11	###a , a , a strong back which was er er say a , a what we call a back in the centre of the ship and course the d n th the steam hopper could heave their own doors up by the steam winch . ###They could put the hook in there and they could lower doors away so there 's no need for the , cos many a time in the dumb hopper when you knock that pin out , they go down with the force and it 'd break and it 'd break the er the chain , the chain link . 
150619:7	###They could put the hook in there and they could lower doors away so there 's no need for the , cos many a time in the dumb hopper when you knock that pin out , they go down with the force and it 'd break and it 'd break the er the chain , the chain link . ###What you had to fix the door ? 
150621:38	###We had to fix the door then then of course the with the big tow on the other dumb hopper to sea . ###Crikey ! 
150622:11	###Crikey ! ###Could you fix the door from inside or fr or did you have to do it from outside ? 
150640:63	###And you say these doors were in the water ? ###The , the d doors were in the water right low , they were , they were low say you would n't have had say about three foot of water in the hold . 
150652:125	###Did they use it for anything ? ###and when we and when we were dredging that up , that used to be all like er er trunks of trees and you could , I mean you could see it when they come up it was very light . 
150674:21	###Pardon ? ###I wonder who designed it ? 
150742:20	###Yeah . ###And then course that used to be different , er used to be different size timber two by sixes , four by twos , inch by one , er inch by ou I mean inch 
150806:11	###Direct ? ###Direct , the same as erm fertiliser coming in , a lot of lorries would come down there and get the fertiliser , different say merchants , different farmers , they used to go through the agent and they 'd buy so much off the agent , this different fertiliser if could n't supply it , what they wanted . 
150808:11	###So the men had to be there at the right time you had t ? ###Oh well , you you 'd be waiting . 
150822:160	###Oh yes . ###See I me so many agents , you got a lot of agents today now so 
150824:52	###you do not mind my taking this method of answering your letter and I hope that you , I did not put you to too much trouble to locate a recorder to listen to the tape , I am just too lazy to write it all down and think that what I have to say I can put it better in words than what I can on paper , I 'll let you do that part . ###The first questions that you brought up was , if possible I would be very grateful to you for a brief description of the two raids to Gdynia Pole ninth of October in Colesfield tenth of October nineteen forty three . 
150855:87	###and myself or as he was better known , came through B Seventeen Transition School at in Florida together and where the crews were formed so that the names in the Army of course are worked alphabetically , so everybody on my crew is trained with everybody on crew and their last name is just ahead erm in the alphabetic in the class that they were in , so that my navigator came from the same school , the same navigation class as . ###The same way with the bombardier waste gunner , radio operators , engineers and all the gunners , so that our crews were all buddy-buddy. crew and my crew were buddy-buddy from the minute we were formed , right on through , I guess you might say the rest of our lives here , even though we have not gotten together since the war but I have talked to on the phone one time when I was in New York City . 
150874:9	###I was just checking here in from the book by and I was looking at the chapter here on Roses Rivetus and er and it was on the mission to Munster here that er Third Combat Mission once a day for three days ' running was to Munster it was this ill-fated mission that made the reputation as the bloody Hundredth and of course this is the one that he only came back from . ###They also see that on page hundred and ninety nine , they have a picture here of crew of Rivetus and I was just getting about these names to mind , his radio operator 's name was , mine was . 
150875:15	###They also see that on page hundred and ninety nine , they have a picture here of crew of Rivetus and I was just getting about these names to mind , his radio operator 's name was , mine was . ###Nobody must have been his bombardier , mine was and my navigator was and I see his would have been . 
150881:20	###You can continue on with this tape . ###Go on I tell you what why do n't you flip it over and start on the other side , even though it says this side done , this is an old tape from a seismograph and er we were afraid to use it in our work but I think the sound 's alright on it , you flip it over and where it says this side down , put that side up and use the other half of the tape and let me hear your comments back . 
150899:10	###What 's making you sleep all day pal ? ###Do you think it 's the drink that 's doing that ? 
150974:10	###There you are David . ###We 'll see you in a couple of weeks again and see how you 're doing . 
150974:31	###There you are David . ###We 'll see you in a couple of weeks again and see how you 're doing .

155014:19	###You see it 's one thing for Jesus to say that it 's another for us to believe it and accept it . ###I mean I can tell you that there 's water in the pipe if you 're thirsty , but you need to go to the pipe with a glass and turn the tap on in order to er not to be thirsty any more , in order to receive the water . 
155015:70	###I mean I can tell you that there 's water in the pipe if you 're thirsty , but you need to go to the pipe with a glass and turn the tap on in order to er not to be thirsty any more , in order to receive the water . ###There is something you have to do in order to receive the gift . 
155021:14	###And er sometimes it takes a bit of courage to walk over to the tap when everybody 's saying there 'll be no water , and for you to turn that tap on . ###Of course when everybody finds that there is water , there 's all sorts of excuses then . 
155021:34	###And er sometimes it takes a bit of courage to walk over to the tap when everybody 's saying there 'll be no water , and for you to turn that tap on . ###Of course when everybody finds that there is water , there 's all sorts of excuses then .

155048:28	###It 's rather like you know you know one remembers the feeding of the five thousand . ###these were extraordinary occurrences , they were n't you know things that were daily available . 
155129:31	###All the people of Israel then are to know for sure that this Jesus , whom you crucified , is the one that , that God has made Lord and Messiah . ###When the people heard this , they were deeply troubled and said to Peter and the other apostles , what shall we do ? 
155169:93	###So wisdom is a gift of the Holy Spirit and that particular thing is to er help us to judge in the way that God does . ###Erm what is the way that God judges ? 
155181:9	###Courage . ###The courage of Peter er after his denial is something that was given him by the Holy Spirit . 
155182:11	###The courage of Peter er after his denial is something that was given him by the Holy Spirit . ###But Peter had to accept it . 
155188:17	###And Paul comes up to him and says , you 're totally wrong , out of order here Peter , erm you know what , what you know I mean you 're afraid , that 's , that 's your problem . ###And er and , and Peter says , you 're right , er I was wrong to do that . 
155189:187	###And er and , and Peter says , you 're right , er I was wrong to do that . ###You know so you have to reach out on a daily basis for these gifts . 
155295:26	###It 's nothing to be bothered about really you know it it 's a good thing to do . ###It 's only a , it 's only a token . 
155339:13	###One is the need for applications . ###Traditionally database management systems have been excellent at decision support . 
155394:64	###So we 'll have a single S twelve query server , a relational database management system , which can be accessed from the applications on the database . ###Now there 's a number of disadvantages to this traditional approach . 
155399:35	###But also the database is passive , it never knows which client is going to communicate with it next . ###It takes requests as and when they turn up and the server deals with them and res returns the results back to the client that requested that information . 
155401:86	###But the S Q L code which is sent to it has to be interpreted when it gets to the server machine , and we all know the difference between compiled and interpreted code . ###But the real disadvantage to this approach is in terms of the control of maintenance because as we 've already said you 'll have done analysis and design on these elementary but fundamental business functions which reside inside the application . 
155544:100	###They will be different in terms of the sort of interaction they expect to have with computer depending on whether they 're data entry people or management users and maybe some of our users are people in the street , our customers er who , who will increasingly become users of systems themselves . ###So whereas in the past we may have been able to think of single user types and single solutions to meet those users . 
155556:22	###And we can impose solutions on our , on our users , you know , you users can all have P Cs , you can all have erm dumb terminals . ###We can decide what you want to use . 
155569:13	###In the real world systems and networks fail so there are times when our systems are not available . ###And that may be okay in a departmental level but when I had an integrated global enterprise operating in integrated fashion around an integrated I T system then clearly I cannot afford to allow a failure to actually paralyse the system . 
155574:10	###And the final point is that vendors will not be able to solve your problem . ###The decision you make today about which vendor you go with and which technology you go with may be the right decision today and yet may , may be the wrong decision tomorrow . 
155575:21	###The decision you make today about which vendor you go with and which technology you go with may be the right decision today and yet may , may be the wrong decision tomorrow . ###You only have to look back over what 's er happened over the last few years in terms of for example O S Two , Microsoft Windows , a variety of Unix , and you 'll see that technologies will come along and however sound a decision you make at one point in time the market circumstances and potentially mean that what was right for you then not the right . 
155584:74	###In fact I 've often said that if you show me a system which does n't have a performance problem then you 've shown me a system which is a failure . ###Because successful systems attract more use and more workload . 
155590:9	###For every dollar you spend on software , he alleges that you 'll spend between one and a half and two dollars simply on getting that software to work the other software you have . ###In other words perhaps fifty percent of the spending on I T is wasted , in inverted commas , because it 's simply concerned with tying together what you already have with the new stuff that you want to integrate in .

155601:52	###Your ###Erm What do they 
155628:13	###So what , how did the racing industry get on during the war . ###How did they manage ? 
155629:66	###How did they manage ? ###Well , they had to , they only raced at Newmarket . 
155630:22	###Well , they had to , they only raced at Newmarket . ###All through the war , they raced at Newmarket see fetched it all to one meeting , so that they did n't have to travel about . 
155639:134	###That were all , all cos of the war , see ? ###Mm . 
155642:7	###You see , because all the Air Force had all the heath , they did n't have a lot of heath to train horses on , you know , then . ###You only had little bits , they claimed Waterhall for , for farming . 
155642:14	###You see , because all the Air Force had all the heath , they did n't have a lot of heath to train horses on , you know , then . ###You only had little bits , they claimed Waterhall for , for farming . 
155663:16	###Mm . ###Galloping ground . 
155665:16	###During the war you had to grow food on it , you said . ###What ? 
155667:7	###During the war you had to grow food on it , you said to me . ###Food . 
155671:7	###during the war , ###Yeah . 
155678:10	###Oh yes they 'd be erm , tt agriculture . ###They 'd ere pinch ' em , you see . 
155680:7	###They 'd have to give so much away . ###Same as the south fields they pinched all a lot of that . 
155683:18	###And these were usually on the training grounds ###Otherwise they 'd have built on it or summat like that you see . 
155708:72	###I did n't know where it was . ###How did the war affect yo your training of the horses ? 
155712:7	###You did n't have none of this . ###No electric lights . 
155713:76	###No electric lights . ###You had to do everything in daylight . 
155715:11	###You know very , that was , that was about the hardest part about it , cos no sooner you were done , you had to start again you understand ? ###Mm 
155725:107	###you done everything exactly the same , only you did n't have the time to do it in . ###You woke up about an hour , you know the nights are shorter . 
155738:35	###Did racing continue the same during the war ? ###Racing ? 
155749:17	###Very , very cutely . ###But , of course you did n't , you did n't have the time to do a lot in the muddy light beat you . 
155887:56	###Mhm . ###that 's what I said . 
155887:105	###Mhm . ###that 's what I said . 
155921:37	###Well he ca n't interfere with him . ###All you do is you put on the list all will want shoeing . 
155921:61	###Well he ca n't interfere with him . ###All you do is you put on the list all will want shoeing . 
155921:84	###Well he ca n't interfere with him . ###All you do is you put on the list all will want shoeing . 
155923:22	###Or come and send for him , h he what has to be in the yard , the blacksmith has to look thirty to forty horses their blacksmith has to look round every one of them . ###He has about sixty here . 
155942:9	###Oh , no . ###So strict . 
155943:7	###So strict . ###So you have to be 
155950:13	###What about in days gone by ? ###Days gone by ? 
155951:122	###Days gone by ? ###Well , you had to send miles for them , did n't you er er blacksmith . 
155984:10	###Yes , but he would n't get the markings unless he be through me . ###Or somebody in the yard he was paying . 
156026:25	###So when you put these markings on your piece of paper ###Yeah . 
156048:9	###You understand ? ###Mm . 
156067:23	###See ? ###Mhm . 
156073:12	###To lead him ? ###To lead the horse . 
156108:12	###Mm . ###Race people , race days you see , people come to their races and put their tents and things up . 
156121:14	###Mhm . ###it do n't open till all the people have used the short gallops . 
156122:7	###it do n't open till all the people have used the short gallops . ###See cos you have to cross over ' em . 
156144:9	###Well , you look through it , and every race meeting that 's on there , probably five or six weeks . ###And you look through every horse wherever you want to put your horse in them races are in that Calendar and you pick your race out , put your horse in , pay your forfeit . 
156151:63	###See , if you want him to stop in it , you gotta keep paying the forfeit all the time th them weeks that go by . ###Same as years ago . 
156152:7	###Same as years ago . ###I do n't know , I do n't think , think it 's altered now , years ago you had to enter your y Derby horse . 
156154:13	###You had to enter them as foals , and then when you entered them it cost you fifty pounds to enter them , and it cost you fifty pounds for every quarter of that lifetime of that foal . ###So you run in the Derby . 
156218:27	###You do n't often get that nowadays . ###No you do n't . because er I naturally I went away to work but er I was born here and er you see and , and wh what else did you want ? 
156258:204	###Well I I was eleven but by the time but I had a birthday , you see , er in the summer and er er well August actually and so when I started at Stowmarket I was twelve , you see , and er and er I was at Stowmarket School and scholarship for four years and er well I do n't know whether I really liked school , did you ? ###Bits of it , not all of it . 
156269:48	###Mm . ###and , and erm I put after leaving Needham Market School , I won a scholarship to Stowmarket Secondary School for four years . 
156273:27	###Well now I do n't know whether you know anything about that but it 's a make words . ###Morse code is it ? 
156281:10	###Oh oh well , yes , well of course er I kn I know about take two more exams and er I know the second one was mental arithmetic . ###Mental arithmetic and reading and I also had er er take an eye test because they said if there was a train accident and I could n't see the signal whether it was red or green or whatever , you see , you never know . 
156319:100	###Erm whilst there I learn how to use another sort of telegraph instrument . ###When I was at the Post Office . 
156319:233	###Erm whilst there I learn how to use another sort of telegraph instrument . ###When I was at the Post Office . 
156357:24	###just like rolls now and a cup of tea ###Oh my word , how it 's gone down . 
156374:91	###You 'd get a message from the R T O the er Railway Transport Office to say supply three hundred and sixty cups of tea at such and such a time and then of course the troops would the train would start , the troops pour out and pour into our place and there we were dashing around . ###I used to help of course and we were up day and night . 
156402:30	###I see what you mean . ###Mm . 
156411:131	###So in the wa in the dining room , they had waiters as well ? ###Oh , yes . 
156431:136	###No , how much would you have earned ? ###Well because I was in the office I got a pound a week , you see , and the , do you know the Manageress there who , she was the Manageress then sorry , I 've got a photograph and she said that when she was Manageress at Colchester and she only got fifteen shillings a week 
156441:12	###We slept there you see . ###So what you had your own room and 
156528:127	###Yes . ###Oh I was and I used to go , and the first place I went to , let me think , it was Dunoon . 
156543:7	###How old were you when you went , first went to Dunoon then ? ###Oh goodness , well 
156548:92	###I booked up in advance of course . ###They put me by a table er near the wall but it for a table for two and then another lady came by herself , I remember her name was Miss and erm and she said , have you been here before ? 
156550:7	###I said , no , and she said oh I have lots of times , I only live at Manchester , you see , and of course , you had to go by boat you see , and I caught the boat train from Ipswich at eight o' clock in the morning and I got to Manchester at lunchtime about one and then went on to Liverpool and the train there took us almost down to the docks . ###Well of course when I went to the Isle of Man , see , I went on the boat and er , you see , and er it only cost me ninepence for a , a landing er for the landing stage . 
156567:294	###well anyway er , you see and well anyway er so when , that night and we were by coach of course bus , went there by bus and so that night she said to me , what are you doing when , in the bus , she said , what are you doing this evening ? ###Well I said I think I 'll go to the theatre and off I went to the theatre . 
156569:106	###I was rather late back , when I got back I heard a knock on my bedroom door and she said it 's Miss and er I said , oh come in , I undid the door and she came in and er and so she said to me er , I just had a telephone message from Peel er to say that you have been subpoenaed to go the Police Court next Thursday and I said what a day out of my holiday and she said , well I 'm sorry but you 'll have to go . ###Yes . 
156644:143	###Nex anyway it 's quite near Portsmouth and we heard that the first Queen Elizabeth ship , they do n't say it 's the first but they call this one the Q E Two but there was a Q E One , you see at one time and so we took a coach from there to Southampton because we heard that she was in dock there and so we went and there were crowds of people and all in a queue waiting to go in . ###Well we took our turn and we waited to go in but once we got in we broke away from the crowd and when they all came out and went to lunch in the town we did n't . 
156696:7	###Mm . ###and his , his er son was one of the lads who worked in the office doing the middle turn , you see , and er I do n't know if he 's still alive . 
156698:97	###He must be eighty , because I mean there was n't all that much difference in our ages . ###You do n't know where he went to when he left ? 
156817:26	###but er I do n't know perhaps we were braver than these days , perhaps you were braver when you 're young ###Mm , yes , perhaps that 's true , yes . 
156855:12	###Yes , yes that 's true yes because how ###old would he be now then ? 
156858:24	###I tried to remember when you said he was born . ###Oh . 
156892:41	###No , not yet . ###I 'm married but I have n't got any family yet 
156914:95	###No , did your father work for Mr ? ###Yes that was his name , you see well , well my father , as I say , he had a stroke and er he was in , in bed in the front room for seven years , you see . 
156983:135	###and you 've got to keep busy and you see now my sight has gone I now , not long distance , I can sit here and see television ###Mm . 
156983:204	###and you 've got to keep busy and you see now my sight has gone I now , not long distance , I can sit here and see television ###Mm . 
157034:7	###It also , in those days was mileage for the tyres was paid on the number of miles run per tyre , so at the end of the month you could record , you knew what tyres were on a certain bus , you knew of how many miles that bus had done , so you recorded that particular tyre on that bus had run so many miles and it was that that we paid for our tyres that way . ###I think it was round about a ha ' penny a mile in those days . 
157035:131	###I think it was round about a ha ' penny a mile in those days . ###We had to pay er there was two lots of erm tyres , there was one set of buses were fitted with and another one with or I forget which it was there but I know those three were involved at some time or other and we used to record the mileage , send it off to them , showing what each bus ran during the month . 
157048:31	###What were they like well the facilities there like ? ###We 'd keep them for a fortnight in those pigeon holes because most people claim stuff if they realize where they 'd left it within a day or two and then as the weeks went round we used to take stuff out of there and just lump it altogether , having duly labelled it up and erm record it and used to have tuppence an item if anybody lost anything . 
157061:21	###With so much cash about , was there any , any problems with security ? ###No , because er I always put it down to the fact that most of our takings were in coin , it was very seldom that you had a pound note , you possibly had a ten pound note in those days but most of it was coinage and the cash when it was married up , was put into steel bound wooden boxes . 
157065:9	###The most time was on Fridays when the drivers and conductors or fitters , everybody used to get their pay packet which was mostly in notes they would immediately go to the depot and say , can I change it . ###So that 's , that 's the only time that we really had lots and lots of notes . 
157068:76	###Not me , no the drivers and conductors and inspectors , they had a uniform and it was seen that they did wear it . ###Just before my time down there , if a man reported for work with a dirty collar or something like that you were sent home . 
157072:39	###Mm . ###but erm 
157102:109	###I , I could n't be adamant about the date of those but er c the reason that motor buses came in is because it was too costly to extend trolley bus routes . ###With , with putting up new , new cables ? 
157126:28	###Is that transport related or ###No , it was n't transport related , I knew that my , my group , because everybody was placed in a certain group by age and , er I knew that I was due to go and I thought oh well this is hanging around you sort of wanted to get on with it . 
157152:137	###Mind you the , the erm , the wages had risen quite a bit during the time . ###I was fortunate in that I was married before the war and the Ipswich Council had decided that married men 's wages would be made up . 
157153:7	###I was fortunate in that I was married before the war and the Ipswich Council had decided that married men 's wages would be made up . ###Erm , so I was constantly getting rises , less my service pay and erm it got to a state there where sometimes my service pay was more than what the erm salary I would have got at home was and my wife had to pay to keep my superannuation live . 
157156:25	###You turn it up . ###fears I er I 'm coming back from the forces I went into the main job , taking over from the previous scheduled clerk by breaking the schedules and the duties . 
157158:12	###The duties being erm what a man had to do to cover that er period of that scheduling . ###As I said before a bus was on a certain route number , say you had one Witton what was had now and then , well that that ran from six o' clock in the morning perhaps till eleven o' clock at night . 
157160:9	###Now that had to be manned by a driver and a conductor for that day . ###Well obviously he could n't work six in the morning till eleven at night . 
157188:62	###B no erm the , the clerical erm staff on the erm , shall we say the traffic side increased a bit because er there was mo more and more demanding work but the ticket office , they went down , erm I have mentioned perhaps before that they had the two box system and there was about eleven , twelve , thirteen girls in there and their duty was to check a box that had been used one day , stock it up with tickets , get it ready for the day after . ###So there was constantly two books , two boxes going . 
157202:148	###The National Association of Local Government Officers . ###I do n't know whether you in . 
157202:178	###The National Association of Local Government Officers . ###I do n't know whether you in . 
157203:12	###I do n't know whether you in . ###Well that was the , the erm union for us , erm I think erm one of the great assets of being in public transport was that we were in a local erm pension scheme , erm when , when we in the office started , we had to wait until we were eighteen and then we had to wait for a vacancy because there was a limited number of people that the Council were prepared to back by paying a similar amount . 
157203:32	###I do n't know whether you in . ###Well that was the , the erm union for us , erm I think erm one of the great assets of being in public transport was that we were in a local erm pension scheme , erm when , when we in the office started , we had to wait until we were eighteen and then we had to wait for a vacancy because there was a limited number of people that the Council were prepared to back by paying a similar amount . 
157205:73	###Drivers and conductors had to wait three years , they had to be employed three years before they were accepted into the pension scheme but you know , believe me I 'm glad that I paid in for it . ###It was a bit of a pill at the time and y used to pay a shilling in the pound , well a shilling was a lot more valuable than it is now and erm I used to begrudge paying in it forty eight and sixpence but it does provide the , well the pleasures of life now , whereby the pens the ordinary old age pension would n't . 
157239:19	###and his white piece of paper , so everything was cancelled . ###Er as regards to the team that was gonna come down from London and I was Secretary of the Football Club at that time . 
157252:29	###They 've got pictures of it , of him preparing all greased up . ###It was our , our answer to cross channel swimming . 
157257:150	###Mm ###and , and you know you could n't get a lot of money , although of course nationally , the rates of pay were governed nationally , they were going up and up and up and there was no way that we could keep pace , we could n't keep on increasing the tuppeny fare . 
157258:7	###and , and you know you could n't get a lot of money , although of course nationally , the rates of pay were governed nationally , they were going up and up and up and there was no way that we could keep pace , we could n't keep on increasing the tuppeny fare . ###They are increased now obviously but erm , you know to put anything on a tuppeny fare then was well a ha ' penny which was twenty five percent on terrible , every year we were going for a fare increase and in those days you really had to go through the Traffic Commissioners . 
157259:20	###They are increased now obviously but erm , you know to put anything on a tuppeny fare then was well a ha ' penny which was twenty five percent on terrible , every year we were going for a fare increase and in those days you really had to go through the Traffic Commissioners . ###You had to go to Cambridge . 
157260:8	###You had to go to Cambridge . ###Loads and loads of information had to be supplied . 
157261:7	###Loads and loads of information had to be supplied . ###You had to satisfy the Traffic Commissioners , that what you are proposing would , would answer the cause , would n't give rise to erm great hardships to the travelling public and erm oh you 're preparing a fare increase about a year before it actually came up to , in front of the Commissioners and then he would erm , perhaps make some alterations or give you a date when you could apply . 
157263:141	###You had to then notify the public at least twenty f twenty four I , no fourteen days before it was due to come in . ###Everybody then had the right to make erm protests against this and could be heard at Cambridge , protesting about fare increases . 
157264:42	###Everybody then had the right to make erm protests against this and could be heard at Cambridge , protesting about fare increases . ###So i it was n't a very easy thing then to get them and as I say you 'd be preparing a fare increase which , perhaps a ha ' penny on certain fares and a penny on fares above a certain range and you had to allow for depreciation , or resistance in the public travelling but er as long as you could always bring in a little extra from a fare increase it was worthwhile going forward . 
157282:59	###It then erm , they would , they went out in one complete entity you see and the trolley wires were just taken down . ###Erm , motor buses very very expensive . 
157284:65	###Another thing you might not realize is that erm , erm when you ordered motor buses you had to get authority from the Ministry of Transport and you used to appl apply for a bus grant . ###Now in its infancy we used to get a fifty percent grant , that was the price of the bus was halved at , Ministry would pay .

157315:125	###I think I got it because of my local knowledge and the that gave him the facility of being able to carry on without interruption . ###If you 'd had all people come in and try to bring in new ideas on to an old system , I do n't think it would have worked .

157323:148	###In fact , you know , he gave the drivers and conductors a lot more than what they were really entitled to but conduct ###What sort of things ? 
157356:7	###They always assumed that er , the disabled were two years behind the normal child so that er ###Mm . 
157370:94	###Yes . ###erm a blind person . 
157385:60	###They had two or three different bus services and erm , the bus went past County Hall so that it was quite , ###Mm . 
157406:110	###Mm . ###Mm . 
157418:16	###so erm , and that went on for , I suppose till the end of the war when er , when we had a reduction in hours again , we went back to the normal nine till half past five . ###Mm . 
157443:46	###You went a little farther along , past erm ' s room . ###being the Chief Clerk and then turned left and down quite a long corridor , which in those days was erm shorned up with four by four timber posts because er , presumably they thought if the County Hall got a direct hit the ceiling might come down 
157476:69	###Incidentally , he was n't known as Chief Education Officer , he was Secretary for Education , he only became Chief Education Officer after the war but erm he was the Controller of Shift E and most of the education staff were on Shift E . ###It so happened that erm Tom tha who I was working with , see he was on Shift er Shift F and er there was always a bit of rivalry between the various shifts as er , as to erm , you know , who did the better job and all this sort of thing 
157526:64	###Yes ###mm 
157528:63	###and erm , then of course when they reached Felixstowe , everything was a bit chaotic because th they had to sleep on the floor in the schools down there ###Mm . 
157550:14	###which subsequently became the Treasurers and erm they used to erm collect the contributions from , from parents and there again I got involved because they were short of typists at one time ###Mm . 
157571:81	###And erm the they went as a unit , staff as most of the staff as well went ###Mm . 
157578:41	###Mm . ###Lowestoft was by far the biggest , erm and Lowestoft had a peculiar sort of administrative set up because they were what was described as erm a Divisional Executive and erm they had powers over their own committees apart from higher education which in modern parlance is further education . 
157621:9	###It 's , it 's much better now er erm , you know people have become a little more understanding of course . ###Mm . 
157662:230	###Erm , sorry of Agriculture not Education ###Mm . 
157668:57	###Mrs er presumably did ###Mm . 
157673:83	###Mm . ###and that in turn of course reported to erm , to the full Education Committee . 
157677:84	###because erm Bill thought that er really the library was his pigeon loft er not Arthur ' s . ###Mm . 
157681:9	###Oh , the librarian was ###Librarian , mm . 
157706:29	###a year , for three years ###Mm . 
157708:90	###and fifty pounds of that was loaned which had to be repaid at the end of the course in sixteen equal quarterly instalments . ###Oh , I see . 
157712:62	###erm failed to pay up it erm , there were all sorts of circumstances which erm made it difficult for the student or difficult for the student or there were certain students of course who just erm tried to avoid paying altogether ###Mm . 
157729:126	###Mm mm ###and then when it got over to the Clerks ' Department they used to stick it on another piece of paper so that they could put it on the file 
157812:18	###Erm , another lecturer that I can remember was erm a chap named who was head at Reydon R E Y School near Southwold . ###He was very interested in astronomy and he used to lecture on the stars and that sort of thing . 
157830:131	###But erm , if I could just erm erm expand a bit on this erm on this erm major awards , er because it was quite interesting , particularly because of the present er , uncertainty about what 's going to happen about students ' grants . ###Mm . 
157832:7	###Erm just er when I first started , I 've already mentioned I think that erm there are about seventeen erm students at universities with major scholarships within the maximum of this erm hundred and fifty pounds a year and erm we inter had to interview all these erm applicants , erm which was n't a very arduous task because there were n't so many of them but ###Mm .

157835:31	###These were fifty pounds a year ###Mm 
157880:199	###as much as erm a grant situation . ###Mm . 
157882:42	###The grants , the of the grants of course increased over the years and the main thing about erm awards of course was to assess them and this is something which erm , I always felt a bit self conscious about because , we had this erm very comprehensive form where parents and erm , oh individuals when they were the students themselves had to complete and give very precise details of income ###Mm . 
157883:44	###Mm . ###and financial circumstances and erm , this was something of course that I had to leave to the people who were working got himself another job . 
157887:91	###And erm , I always felt sorry for the people working in Inland Revenue because er , they were , they were having to do it all the time ###Mm . 
157904:19	###the thing and in those days they used to have the punched cards , you know , erm they still have this ###Yes . 
157974:53	###Colleagues , can I extend a very warm welcome to a number of special guests who are attending conference Ryan , head of the international department of and John , U S Embassy 's councillor for labour affairs I 'm not sure exactly where our colleagues are yes John ###and an omnibus vote of , er , an omnibus welcome for a very large number of colleagues who are attending , er conference this year , Kevin , Birmingham regional president Jack , retired Lancashire regional secretary John , retired Liverpool regional secretary John , retired London regional secretary Cyril , retired Midland regional secretary , hang on , it goes on Andrew , retired Northern regional secretary Jim , Scottish retired regional secretary Derek , retired Southern regional secretary it 's a good job we 've got a good pension fund 
158020:60	###Do they want to float free answerable to no one and free to trade with other political parties of political power in exchange for new voting systems , which have absolutely no credibility with us and absolutely have no credibility with the British people , cos they do n't want it ! ###We stand for a de democratic party but we will not allow a bunch of politicians to hijack this party ! 
158029:53	###Last year congress carried a motion on racism and fascism expressing its alarm at the rise of fascism and racism in Germany and France this has always been a trade union issue . ###We were the first union in nineteen seventy six to come out with our policy on the then Race Relations Act it 's always been a trade union issue whether it was the trade unions in Germany in the twenties and thirties fighting Hitlerism and Nazi-ism or whether it was the trade unions fighting Moseley and his black shirts in Britain it has always been part of our ideals and principles . 
158033:53	###We are appalled at the attack and murder of the migrant Turkish workers and their families in Germany . ###And in Britain between nineteen eighty eight and nineteen ninety one there has been a doubling of racist attacks in large areas of London it is now commonplace for such attacks to take place . 
158039:43	###The G M B has argued for change in how the T U C operates . ###We believe the T U C 's role should be one of more services to its affiliates to direct membership with greater emphasis on health and safety and recruitment .

158148:158	###President , colleagues , I am so proud and honoured to receive this gold badge , more so because this is the award given to me by you President , I do want to thank a number of people I also want to thank the regional secretary , Steve , who thank you , Steven , for your support and guidance . ###I pay a great tribute to my dad , who as a trade unionist on the railway would have been so proud to see me receive this very great honour . 
158198:10	###We need to be in the Labour Party it is only there that we the unions can take part in making policy about the future of our industries and services , and taking care of our members . ###Better that we get rid of these people in the Labour Party if they do not want our involvement let them go and form their own party , as a trade union ordinarily formed originally formed the Labour Party ! 
158200:7	###And that must be the cry tell them , go and join your own party . ###Let us remind the Labour Party that they should be attacking this useless Tory government , not supporting them , not voting with them , not supporting them by abstaining when necessary we 'll never get power that way ! 
158205:23	###Settle down President . ###Er , colleagues it 's now my great pleasure to ask Giles , M P for Durham North , to address congress on behalf of the G M B parliamentary panel . 
158227:115	###For their part for the , for the part of the Labour Party , trades unionists provide a solid and substantial electoral base which , which , which will hopefully increase during the nineteen nineties . ###And there is also the crucial issue of political financing which we 've heard about already this morning , and which is such a vexed question in French Spanish , and Italian politics now everybody wants to see more money coming from an expanded , er , political membership . 
158238:15	###But it 's no secret , however and er we 've heard echoes of that this morning that there is a lively debate as to the pre precise details of what a reform package should be . ###John Smith the leader of our Party has put forward his own personal preference for one member one vote for the selection of candidates , with a special cut rate for trades unionists who pay the political levy . 
158239:12	###John Smith the leader of our Party has put forward his own personal preference for one member one vote for the selection of candidates , with a special cut rate for trades unionists who pay the political levy . ###Now his view obviously has to be seriously considered put forward , as it is , by a leader who has the support , when he was elected , of ninety percent of the Party , including ninety percent of the unions . 
158271:16	###Conference , chair , Mary , Falkirk , G M B Scotland . ###We have argued for many years that the present discrimination on the grounds of sex and state pensions and retirement age is unjustifiable . 
158272:63	###We have argued for many years that the present discrimination on the grounds of sex and state pensions and retirement age is unjustifiable . ###A much wider consultation process must be initiated , before far-reaching changes can be agreed . 
158282:7	###Many people are unaware of that fact . ###The fact that the basic state pension is not a universal benefit , but is based on the level of payment , . 
158284:20	###You have to earn enough for long enough , ninety percent of your working life , to qualify . ###Consequently we will argue that for the very least we need current levels of basic state pension and SERPS , and see that they are available to both men and women from the age of sixty . 
158290:7	###Congress , this composite is about a deceit , a deceit by the Tory government , of men and women , over their working lives women in particular who have been contributing their stamp all their working lives and are now being told that there is a danger that they will not get their state pensions at sixty . ###Conference , it is absolutely vital that those people are protected . 
158292:7	###We must ensure that we campaign as hard as possible , that sixty becomes the state pension age for all our members , men and women . ###Congress , if as a trade union , and if as a labour movement , you stop going forward in campaigning , there 's only one thing that happens you start to go backwards , because this government will always try and take from working class people , all the time . 
158296:11	###President , congress , John , supporting composite twenty six . ###We trust the C E C to campaign vigorously against the Tory Party proposal of increasing women 's pension age to sixty five . 
158316:23	###I now call the mover of motion three six nine , standing charges to be moved by the Lancashire region and if there is a seconder , if he or she could come down . ###President , conference with the introduction of V A T on gas and electric bills , this motion becomes even more important . 
158317:25	###President , conference with the introduction of V A T on gas and electric bills , this motion becomes even more important . ###It was bad enough when pensioners had to pay the standing charges on their gas , water and telephone bills . 
158318:9	###It was bad enough when pensioners had to pay the standing charges on their gas , water and telephone bills . ###It is even worse now that they have got to pay V A T on those bills as well . 
158335:59	###Let them watch television if they want when they want free of charge . ###I move . 
158340:64	###My television licence is a colour television and it costs me eighty three pound for this year . ###In nineteen eighty seven , it cost fifty seven pound this has increased by almost twenty nine per cent in the last five years . 
158353:62	###Thank you , Dick . ###Charlie , Southern region and a pension fund trustee . 
158359:186	###Now that has been addressed , particularly by the G M B , and we 've campaigned to have pension funds in employ with employers to be open to all , so everybody can join pension funds . ###We 've got a number of good pension funds that ordinary working people can join , but the issue that has come about since compulsory competitive tendering privatization is those members that 've been in pension funds for maybe twenty , twenty five years now they 're out on the open job market with the wonderful privatized world that we live in , with a free market , and they ca n't afford to make adequate pension provision for themselves . 
158381:9	###It is clearly unacceptable that workers ' pensions are open to such abuse by the employers . ###It is not satisfactory that workers ' pension funds remain vulnerable to the predators . 
158390:66	###I endorse the need for , and the urgency of , our union to spearhead the campaign prevent the contributions of our members being used as a corporate slush fund . ###The reluctance of this government to introduce legislation only strengthens my belief that the scale of the Maxwellian type fraud is far greater than any of us ever imagined .

158391:7	###The reluctance of this government to introduce legislation only strengthens my belief that the scale of the Maxwellian type fraud is far greater than any of us ever imagined . ###For the prospect of a retirement pension for all those presently under fifty years of age is looking distinctly forlorn we must protect the pension rights of all contributing members we must insist that trustees are elected from the shop floor and not appointed by some faceless director who may not even reside in this country . 
158400:83	###Thank you , I move . ###Kish , Lancashire region , seconding composite twenty seven . 
158434:7	###They have the worst of both worlds a government who wants to attack their pension rights and an employer willing to do the government 's bidding . ###Very strange story this . 
158483:71	###As our economy has declined as our recession has turned to a slump increasingly it is the low-paid , the sick , the disabled and the unemployed who have been forced to pick up the tab for the Tory policy failure . ###Congress , as we all know , the latest Tory plans have once again hit the least well off . 
158533:48	###And if there is a seconder , if he or she could come down please . ###Morning team , congress Jackie , Scotland . 
158651:28	###A CAB in Oxfordshire reports a nineteen year old client who worked for twenty hours a week in a shop . ###She was paid four pounds an hour . 
158652:96	###She was paid four pounds an hour . ###Her employers then told her that she would have to work full time , double the hours , for only two pounds an hour . 
158666:7	###That was something of a first in itself . ###What he said was , I want British workers to be the top of every league table in the world . 
158688:102	###What other explanation can there be for the promotion of John Selwyn Gummer , one of the worst ministers in living memory , mostly remembered for force-feeding his daughter a hamburger to prove that he was n't worried about catching mad cow disease . ###An inventive man , Mr Gummer . 
158690:7	###He got into a little bit of trouble over some tax payers ' contributions a short time ago and I particularly enjoyed his explanation of why we , the tax payers of this country , had to pay for refurbishing his house and garden . ###Apparently it was for security reasons . 
158704:7	###Forget the bullshit about the Citizen 's Charter . ###If you want to find the reality of Britain today , after fourteen years of Conservatism , go to a D S S office , or a Job Centre , or a Citizens Advice Bureau , and look at the misery of a country that will not provide sustenance and dignity for its people . 
158721:10	###I do n't know when that commitment was ever abandoned but sure as hell it should be reinforced today . ###A belief in public services , civilized standards at work , real opportunities for young people , and a bit of an end to elitism , an economy based not on the fragile skills of a few whizz-kid managers but firmly grounded in the talent and ingenuity of all of our people . 
158779:28	###The export of animals , we took this up with a number of animal welfare organizations and at this very moment if you ah sharpen your eyesight you will see that a search is being made for the letters . ###I will ensure that you will get copies of those so that you know that this matter has been fulfilled in the way that was promised . 
158815:17	###I will only give one . ###On the Thursday before Good Friday I was informed by letters , Regional Officers if they were contactable , received telephone calls from Regional Personnel Managers , informing us that on the following Tuesday checkout supervisors were to be told that their jobs no longer existed . 
158818:46	###This was done despite the Union 's protests . ###They blatantly ignored procedural agreements in force . 
158819:30	###They blatantly ignored procedural agreements in force . ###It took us until the following Friday to get to accept that they had to follow procedure , by which time of course the damage was done . 
158870:111	###The employers can see an advantage . ###If workers can be recruited on a Sunday only basis , with no premium rates and no National Insurance for the employer , then that 's fine . 
158870:122	###The employers can see an advantage . ###If workers can be recruited on a Sunday only basis , with no premium rates and no National Insurance for the employer , then that 's fine . 
158872:66	###If this takes away the full employment from others , that 's even better , and if this helps to undermine the trade union organization , well that is even better still , but we must fight , we must fight to make sure that this does not happen and colleagues , if we are brutally honest , this is exactly what is happening . ###Trade union membership in the retail sector is continuing to decline at a time when this spectre is still growing . 
158902:38	###What has changed over the last two years ? ###Little in Sunday trading , except the th the thing that the recession has done forced people to take on jobs often at below the rate , take on jobs for the one day , whatever . 
158922:12	###That would cover most of the things my colleague mentioned earlier . ###A shop register would be kept with Local Authorities before they open on a Sundays . 
158967:49	###But we accepted that . ###The government has failed to prevent Sunday trading . 
158974:41	###The G M B will continue to oppose practices which force people to work on Sundays against their will . ###This will go against religious beliefs , harm family life and be unacceptable for existing employer employees . 
158976:9	###Sundays are special and people who choose to work on Sundays must be paid appropriate premium rates for their labour . ###At Congress nineteen ninety two we established an Employment Rights Policy which supports legislation which whi wis where this reflects trade union negotiation rights . 
159010:150	###These included child care , maternity pay , and we also did an in-depth survey called quality pay which seeked and looked for alternatives to piecework and looked in depth at the introduction of teamwork . ###Those documents are available . 
159013:31	###A social clause is essential . ###A social clause which would recognize workers ' rights such as freedom of association and collective bargaining . 
159019:54	###One or two have . ###If you read Threads you will see the story . 
159022:132	###But , for most employers , most retailers , they hide behind the excuse of not knowing . ###They 're ignorant . 
159030:23	###If we stop buying goods by child la made by child labour , and do n't say , well we did n't know , ask . ###Stand in Marks and Spencers and ask where it was made . 
159035:9	###I 've got copies of the charter . ###I 'd be happy to give anyone one who wants one , but more importantly could I say again , make sure what you 're buying is not made by exploited children . 
159058:12	###Our difficulty is that the contractual position is clearer than unfair dismissal law so employers can sometimes , though by no means always , achieve the same result by issuing notices of dismissal and offering new contracts of employment . ###However , the new Trade Union Act applying a European directive will require employers to consult with trade unions before issuing dismissal notices in such cases . 
159135:10	###In local councils , in trade union movement it 's damage limitation , it , it 's stopping the worst of Tory legislation and policies , in particular C C Ts . ###I 'm proud that in the last two years under my administration we have not had one compulsory redundancy , and it 's not easy I can assure you . 
159193:8	###It 's our members in these industries who 've been given a hammering since privatization and who need as much support as possible to give them the confidence to face further difficult years ahead . ###Far from being lectured by those who 're making millions out of privatization . 
159193:39	###It 's our members in these industries who 've been given a hammering since privatization and who need as much support as possible to give them the confidence to face further difficult years ahead . ###Far from being lectured by those who 're making millions out of privatization . 
159196:27	###It will take time , I 've detected , as I 'm sure you have too delegates , a feeling of confidence in our debates so far at this conference , a confidence that has n't been there recently . ###It 's our job to transfer that confidence from the conference hall to the workplace . 
159200:39	###More of the same , more privatization , more fragmentation , more job losses , and more demoralization with our membership . ###The debate on energy policy is a vital one , and one which the G M B as the only union with a sizable membership in all of the industries concerned , is well placed to lead . 
159238:9	###They want to stifle it well and truly . ###There was a problem during the er evidence to the various committees that were looking at the coal crisis and the problems in relation to coal , in that very often people were translating it into tonnage and the number of pits etcetera , whereas the argument needed to be that the rules of the game had been rigged in the first place at the privatization of electricity and the rules of the game need to be changed if we 're gonna succeed . 
159299:50	###Sammy , Scottish region . ###What the , President and colleagues as well as presenting himself as a great European leader , a demand which is not seen as be particularly , although at the moment , John Major and his government have sought to present themselves as green . 
159302:9	###One of the agreements which our government signed at Rio , was for the setting up of a sustainability plan for a British economy , yet ever since the end of that conference , these proposals have been getting successfully watered down and deleted . ###We need to demand that Major keeps his promise , Britain is already , our willingness to go lightly on transgressors in the pollution field , is becoming legendary . 
159312:12	###The issue of water and the ownership of water in Scotland is a very emotive issue . ###It 's an issue which has totally united every aspect of the Scottish community . 
159339:7	###That 's Britain today . ###Radical change is needed . 
159432:65	###The increased use of gas to produce elect electricity will result in faster exhaustion of our resources while the subsequent closure of the mines will deny us access to hundreds of years of our richest and greatest energy reserves . ###Britain needs a balanced energy policy , which ensures that our varied and rich reserves are utilized in the most efficient way . 
159434:51	###The qualification with respect to comp sixteen is that congress needs to be aware that a future Labour government will have to decide between many competing priorities . ###The Tories are also attacking our Health Service , our children 's education , and are failing to invest in the training and research necessary to produce substantial economic recovery . 
159492:9	###It 's overshadowing the proceedings of this conference and other union conferences . ###It 's keeping the Labour leader awake at nights , the column inches , full of knocking copy , and letting the Tories off the hook . 
159553:64	###Now turn to page one O four , one O five , one O six and one O seven , and one O eight . ###Tom could you respond to those points please . 
159652:7	###We listened to Jack Straw among others . ###What an experience , talk about Tory wets . 
159687:99	###All of these are key political issues . ###Er , we call on Labour Mem Members of Parliament to give their support in each of these areas mentioned , and we do constantly have a dialogue and provide what is the union line in terms of erm these particular er issues . 
159687:109	###All of these are key political issues . ###Er , we call on Labour Mem Members of Parliament to give their support in each of these areas mentioned , and we do constantly have a dialogue and provide what is the union line in terms of erm these particular er issues . 
159697:40	###We expect sponsored M Ps to be present at important votes , and particularly on these occasions when our members are likely to be infect affected . ###The motion goes on to say that sponsored M Ps should not pair with erm Conservatives . 
159756:7	###In that same year , on behalf of the union , I went to the rostrum at the Labour Party Conference , to move a resolution calling for the end of the block vote . ###I actually used the phrase this motion is the death- knell of the block vote , and the beginning of individual voting of trade union members within the part Party . 
159802:49	###Anyway , the collection realized six hundred and thirteen pound , plus the thousand from London . ###That came to six hundred , sixteen hundred and thirteen and that will be doubled by the C E C. Thank you very much . 
159809:54	###One other matter before I ask the General Secretary I think our colleague might want to say something after the General Secretary . ###Erm colleagues who attended the Blackpool Conference last year will recall that there was , that we had a visit from a young boy called who was the son of one of our officers and that er was suffering from I think I recall a very severe form of leukaemia . 
159865:23	###Hope you enjoyed yourselves last night . ###Conference , thank you Mick , Apex is going places , there 's no doubt about that . 
159865:49	###Hope you enjoyed yourselves last night . ###Conference , thank you Mick , Apex is going places , there 's no doubt about that . 
159947:15	###As I 've already said , we agree that the wording could have been better . ###The C E C when they 're talking about motions sometimes say that they accept them with the qualification and I 'd like to say to Congress this morning will you accept a qualification from the branch moving this to say that we are talking about groups of members and their needs not individuals ? 
159966:28	###In respect of motion one five eight , the C E C is opposed because it is based upon a misunderstanding of the purposes of sectionalization . ###This Union faces strong competition in almost every sector in which it organizes . 
159967:22	###This Union faces strong competition in almost every sector in which it organizes . ###In order that we can respond , we must organize ourselves , industry and by sector . 
160000:46	###Our rail network is the lowest funded , the lowest staffed and has the lowest investment programme in Europe with the poorest quality service and the fastest declining level of safety , but B R has the highest fares . ###Since nineteen eighty three the government has reduced financial support by over two billion pound and reduced staff by seventy thousand , resulting in less maintenance and falling safety standards and with , as I said higher fares , but fewer services . 
160003:7	###Of course not , in fact it will probably be the reverse with even higher fares , less if any off-peak services and maybe closures of unprofitable lines . ###The government plan to help private operators by robbing the Railworkers ' Pension Fund of millions of pounds to subsidize their operations for passenger and freight on a scale that B R have never ever known . 
160006:53	###It is obvious the way the railway should move forward not privatization but a reversal of the underfunding and a move to a total commitment of higher financial support . ###If Richard Branson wants to run trains , let him build a network and , and compete against a properly funded British Rail . 
160006:112	###It is obvious the way the railway should move forward not privatization but a reversal of the underfunding and a move to a total commitment of higher financial support . ###If Richard Branson wants to run trains , let him build a network and , and compete against a properly funded British Rail . 
160014:24	###They make them up as they go along . ###It 's very difficult to find any support at all for rail privatization outside a handful of ministers . 
160052:54	###They include a greater control of shipping and the use of double skin hulls for dangerous cargoes . ###There 's a certain irony here in the fact that the world leader in free market philosophy should be the one to try and bring some regulation into this area , because that 's the problem here , almost complete deregulation the use of convenient ships , low skilled , low paid er exploited often Third World workers , used and abused by ship owners the world over to increase their profit margins , with a subsequent lack of concern over both the environment and people 's lives . 
160170:9	###Congress , the C E C has asked me to accept motion three one four and composite eighteen to refer motions three one six and three one eight and to accept motion three one nine . ###On motion three one four British Rail Privatization . 
160171:14	###On motion three one four British Rail Privatization . ###This government has got to be really be joking with its proposals for example the West Coast Line from north to south is estimated to require in the region of eight hundred million to cover track repairs and modernization as well as outdated rolling stock and signal replacements . 
160176:175	###I do n't think they will . ###At least not when I 'm passing on that cost to you the users and as any cost increase will decrease the use of further track closures will follow . 
160215:64	###Last year the A W U was formed and next month UNISON comes into existence . ###This debate is about how we will respond and in a very real sense , it 's about the future of the whole trade union movement in Britain . 
160253:15	###Legal representation very important , maybe also pension schemes that can provide real pension protection . ###Quick-fire advice down the phone or face-to-face on work-related issues . 
160310:149	###Yes London Region er Group Four Security , have you noticed we 've lost another prisoner last night and he nicked me trousers ! ###We er we concur with the General Secretary 's er when he said two years ago there will be four super unions by the year two thousand obviously that 's gonna be a reality . 
160310:192	###Yes London Region er Group Four Security , have you noticed we 've lost another prisoner last night and he nicked me trousers ! ###We er we concur with the General Secretary 's er when he said two years ago there will be four super unions by the year two thousand obviously that 's gonna be a reality . 
160320:28	###Obviously , if we 're gonna be two big unions obviously Portsmouth is no longer going to fit the bill and I think that 's a shame because several congresses I 've been to and this is the finest weather I 've ever enjoyed . ###Ca n't argue with that . 
160335:66	###Many of the points that I make in this speech have already been covered by John , but they are important and deserve to be repeated . ###The matters of employing people is changing and in the main those changes fly in the face of traditional G M B organization and make recruitment and retention of membership more difficult . 
160336:65	###The matters of employing people is changing and in the main those changes fly in the face of traditional G M B organization and make recruitment and retention of membership more difficult . ###Whatever the reasons for these changes , be they because of a hostile government , new technology or the European dimension , we must respond and change if we are to survive as a creditable organization . 
160337:59	###Whatever the reasons for these changes , be they because of a hostile government , new technology or the European dimension , we must respond and change if we are to survive as a creditable organization . ###The employment situation described in the motion are no longer the exception , they are the rule and as such we must sharpen up our recruitment act . 
160338:7	###The employment situation described in the motion are no longer the exception , they are the rule and as such we must sharpen up our recruitment act . ###That is not to say we should adopt the hard sell or abandon our traditional value , but we must seriously examine how we can appeal to more desperate scattered membership . 
160339:7	###That is not to say we should adopt the hard sell or abandon our traditional value , but we must seriously examine how we can appeal to more desperate scattered membership . ###We must seriously examine how we can involve such membership in the decision making of the Union and carry them with us through change . 
160371:19	###President , Congress , Liverpool Region support the document . ###We do need closer links , not only with the T & G but also with other unions , but let 's not forget that other unions are organizing to build up their membership at the expense of the G M B. We need to make up our minds do we want an amalgamation or not . 
160392:70	###To be fair , the C E C have not tried to say that everything in the garden is rosy , they 've also highlighted a number of problem areas that still exist . ###Indeed all look at the recent decision by the and Allied Trade Union to the members who have amalgamated themselves Transport and General Workers . 
160413:10	###Derogatory terms . ###I came into the G M B and heard exactly the same kind of derogatory comments about the Transport and General Workers ' Union . 
160414:7	###I came into the G M B and heard exactly the same kind of derogatory comments about the Transport and General Workers ' Union . ###Comrades we must put to one side these kind of , this kind of fighting . 
160453:142	###Right , next piece of advice . ###er if you 've got formulae , when you set them up , you should set them up so that you can copy them . 
160474:149	###Means the four never change if you copied the formula ? ###The C can change if you copy it to another column and the C put it to the right the C changes to a D if you put a dollar in front of them both then neither can change . 
160479:8	###Erm , take this example here , er , I 've got sales being calculated , say units , times the price , C four times C six , now I want to add a product B so I might , I might be here and think oh I 'll insert a row here and copy the formula and go up to there and insert a row , and so on . ###But if I do that , well , I copy the C four , C six down have C five , C seven and then when I go in and insert the extra rows then er , well that formula 's not going to refer to those new rows that I insert it 's still cell the right of price and the right of sales the wrong sales certainly . 
160711:14	###When you 've copied the blank , erm , it 's not formatted , it 's not unprotected , as well any more So ###How can menu 
160808:13	###I can do that ampersand that or those two cells have got range names the range names . ###Erm , if I put a space in , it might look a bit better . 
160963:30	###I do n't think I will ###Diagonally . 
161006:13	###It would be easier than a password if you need to check out changing the ###Yeah . 
161055:28	###Erm , what did I recommend you do with whizzy-wig . ###In the case out sum . 
161096:27	###And they get chopped off where ? ###About to two hundred and forty characters . 
161541:13	###So , as you retrieve it , it 's updated the file . ###That sounds very good . 
161589:9	###E twenty six , I 've named zero three , and so on . ###That 's my normal naming convention , my normal naming convention is use the first two letters W L. W I 've explained , and L stands for linking . 
161606:7	###yes , you can have diff different opening formulae with a different part name in it . ###Yes , but no not into the one cell . 
161610:44	###Yeah . ###Erm . 
161611:90	###Erm . ###You ca n't link a whole range to a whole range , you can only have to one cell . 
161663:94	###Erm , the analogy is the filing cabinets . ###Er , you would n't have a great big stack of paper in the corner of the room . 
161691:84	###Then if you 've got one called DOS . ###Put the DOS programs in there 
161696:33	###But if you put two three ###and I put in in the sub-directory . 
161707:7	###use it . ###How do you get into DOS ? 
161712:24	###You could quit . ###Yeah . 
161716:104	###So you quickly get back so it 's pointing at my one two three directory , so if I do M D ###yeah . 
161755:62	###Sub-directories Er , yes , you could type er , back-slash ###back-slash put and then press enter , and it lists the sub-directories and you highlight that and press enter and then it would list where the files are in that directory , of course , I have n't got any , we 've just created those directories . 
161786:7	###What I 've done in the past , is erm , for file retrieve and then erm , on top of the original do a slash put and then enter , and that then gives me a sub-file . ###Basically , it lists the files on that directory , yes . 
161787:64	###Basically , it lists the files on that directory , yes . ###You have to type put every time . 
161797:12	###Probably some others as well here . ###As regards to various er other chores like deleting a set of files or copying a set of files , if you do n't want the ninety three files any more you just delete all the files in the directory . 
161825:12	###You can , you alre can very quickly focus in on the one you 're after , and you 'd be sure that was the one , and you retrieve it and it 's there . ###Very quickly . 
161837:10	###The whole , whatever 's on that erm . ###Would be all D twenty two . 
161891:14	###You 're probably very proud of your masterpiece , and erm , there 's ot there 's the temptation to keep making minor improvements , just to make it a bit better . ###Er , but any change you make to a computer system , is likely to introduce bugs into the system , so that it does n't give the right answers any more . 
161895:35	###Erm , what you need to do is , if you can , save up all the changes , for one batch and then do them all together . ###Cos there 's economy to scale on , first economy is the scale on understanding the system . 
161897:11	###Before you can make changes to the system , you have to understand it , and that takes an awful long time . ###Er , so there 's economy to scale on that , and there 's the economy to scale on testing too . 
161907:10	###Then most of the , the rows also come out with nice round numbers , except this one row here , stands out . ###Numbers look a bit odd there . 
161911:7	###You start with nice constant round simple numbers . ###There 's all sorts of ex it 's probably impractical to test every single cell . 
161935:7	###No matter how erm , simple or small a change you 're making , you 'll probably think oh , that 's bound to work , no need to test that , such a simple change . ###You 'd be surprised . 
161942:66	###that 's a point testing certain aspects . ###It 'll often pay to think about er , the order in which you test . 
161942:145	###that 's a point testing certain aspects . ###It 'll often pay to think about er , the order in which you test . 
161943:65	###It 'll often pay to think about er , the order in which you test . ###Because if yo if you got to the end of testing and then you found an error , you might have to go all the way back to the beginning again , because what it affects affects something that you did earlier on , so you have to go back and test everything again . 
161964:9	###The same reasons as er , testing , er , you ought to do it as you go . ###Because if you come back later on , and try and document your spreadsheets , then an awful lot is forgotten . 
162001:72	###Do you want to delete it or whatever . ###It might be useful to know who was doing that . 
162005:7	###Did you hear that ? ###Yeah . 
162021:44	###You do this , this , this , this , this , this , this , this , this , this and this . ###To do some other tasks , you do this , this , this , this and this and so on . 
162032:42	###Tells somebody how to get to particular help screens or people often have difficulty finding things on the help screens , so , some instructions for where to find a particular piece of information on the help screens can be useful . ###You can create a basic form of map on the spreadsheet . 
162175:57	###Er , if you create a file linking formulae in One Two Three Release Two , erm , when you retrieve a file that contains the file with the formulae , er , does it update the file links , as you retrieve it ? ###That 's the question . 
162291:35	###The input area . ###The report to calculations . 
162583:61	###of addresses down . ###Yeah . 
162689:14	###Erm I think too of course the thing about probation to go back to that , ###Mm . 
162690:67	###Mm . ###is that you have to be accepted by the Home Office as well as the erm you know particular institution running the course . 
162711:9	###But , well I think they check that sort of thing for social workers do n't they ? ###Yeah they do , yeah I read that yeah . 
162727:199	###I mean I suppose there is in all social work in a sense , that if you go in to look at a family and , and you 're trying to assess you know whether the children should be taken into care , well you 're exercising a a sort of statutory erm er sort of responsibility , and as far as the clients are concerned , er if you , like that can sort of get in the way of er er a more human sort of relationship if you see what I mean , because ###Mm . 
162970:9	###Erm there 's this erm Rudolf Steiner community which is part of the Camp Hill Village Trust . ###Mm . 
162987:16	###Erm I mean maybe they have n't had very much , but erm but in , in a sense there 's a sort of huge commitment on their part to that , because they actually , I remember some chap came over to do the talk and I think he 's got four kids and he said , well you know , I did n't know how my kids were going to react to people fine you know ###Mm . 
162991:22	###Mm . ###cream and grow potatoes and all this and probably they have bees and sell honey and you know they eat er they really try to be self- sufficient sort of community as much as they can . 
162996:29	###that sort of thing , so they make some things and sell them . ###Erm and er but he 's worked at that you see , but he does n't get any money for it I do n't think . 
163000:24	###you know it does n't they they do n't erm sort of exist in the social security system like the rest of us do , ###Mm . 
163065:29	###Mm . ###because you 've just taken on too much . 
163073:19	###And that 's not very good , you know . ###I mean your own aim is really to make yourself superfluous in the end . 
163076:56	###And they do n't really want to go on using you as a a sort of prop , because I mean you ca n't afford that because you 've got lots of other clients and you , you know really the aim is to try and get them back to self-sufficiency . ###Mm . 
163092:21	###Mm . ###You know . 
163330:100	###Er what I actually mean is whenever you have an idiom , you can substitute in the position of a whole sentence or of a verb phrase , but you ca n't substitute it for a subject and a verb , leaving the object of the sentence intact . ###Yeah , so , so Okay then the general I 'm for is that in a subject verb object sentence there 's very important sense in which the verb and the object go together , they form one unit and one constituent of a sentence , whereas subject and verb do n't . 
163333:53	###You 're the literary one . ###A , because it 's not an idiom , and B even if it were it would be a whole sentence , because walk is intransitive . 
163363:37	###Okay , but the item that licenses them the other licensing sentence you need in order to license these items , you ca n't just go anywhere in the sentence so sentence three , herself saw Florence is no good , even though Florence is there , it 's in the wrong place relative to herself and similarly six , anyone saw no one is no good , even though no one is in the sentence . ###So what we need to do is you need to figure out what kind of items license erm reflects the pronouns like herself and make it a polarity items like anyone . 
163425:7	###Erm , the grim erm , the , the crow sang John 's name , the crow sang James ' name do you know what I mean ? ###And that does n't sound funny at all . 
163452:189	###It 's just that it 's the ###yeah . 
163452:222	###It 's just that it 's the ###yeah . 
163453:16	###yeah . ###It just ca n't be , be the , I mean if you think of all the , I mean like say you 've got a , a , a sort of er cockney expression for if he 's got syphilis might be something like you know Johnny Rotten 's kissed him or something you know , there must be things like that , you know , there must be loads of things like that . 
163467:52	###syphilis ###You 're right , it does n't sound odd , but then the question is why does this all really occur ? 
163492:91	###Basically because in syntax you get all the structure you need for semantics and some more , which does n't do any harm . ###Now , suppose you are designing a language learning and using machine you really would n't want to have separate levels of structure for syntax and semantics . 
163502:79	###That 's the basic idea and the fact that we do actually learn , becomes less mysterious . ###So now , if syntactic and semantic structure are the same then both kinds of evidence , both semantic evidence and syntactic evidence will , will constrain the choice of structure . 
163527:56	###Er , yeah . ###It 's just I mean as philosophy just very standardly takes words from ordinary language gradually gets a technical meaning , er which is different from the original meaning and then when ordinary speakers use it in the original meaning they get told off . 
163532:104	###Necessary er all those things . ###It 's hard , I mean it 's , it 's difficult to tell , difficult to decide when the meaning has actually changed it 's a notoriously hard problem , which nobody really knows how to solve in the principle way . 
163534:62	###Nevertheless sometimes it clearly has and other times it clearly has n't , so there does seem to be a line there , even if we do n't yet know , we certainly have to draw it . ###Mm . 
163535:117	###Mm . ###Erm I do n't know if I mean remember that in order to do any compositional semantic theory , you have to assign structuring . 
163549:16	###But is it true about the semantic structure where you can say it has n't got a verb phrase ###yeah . 
163558:47	###Okay if you said the first one was saw , ###Mm . 
163567:15	###but that 's ungrammatic . ###Yeah , but that 's what I 'm saying there 's 
163568:19	###Yeah , but that 's what I 'm saying there 's ###So that you 'd have to 
163573:10	###So I mean by , by all means do n't take any of this for , for granted . ###Yeah . 
163574:7	###Yeah . ###Well you have to 
163587:68	###You 'll notice that I gave that one a miss , because I had erm , so much more pressing things to do . ###But , erm perhaps I 'll get round to it . 
163654:20	###Well , I 'm sorry about that , I mean that , that 's really very naughty of them . ###Wh what , what er , answers that ? 
163665:27	###Why , should there be conflict over parental investment , because after all , children are the link product of success of their parents , so shortly child and parent have got exactly the same self interest have n't they ? ###Yes , and that 's a good erm , starting point . 
163721:10	###Obviously , if you 're a very tiny newborn baby , the amount of food you need to er , put on extra pound weight , is , is not going to be the same as if you are a much larger child , and you want to put on proportionately the same amount of X pounds , whatever it would be , it would be same the same proportion of your weight . ###Er , it could be one pound possibly with a child . 
163799:30	###Last week 's New Scientist , I think it was , or the one before , was a study of one particular type of bird with , I ca n't remember wh what kind of bird . ###It was kind of dark , and apparently what happened to this , towards the end of the period of parental investment , when the parents come back to feed the ducklings , they insist on the ducklings following them . 
163830:23	###Oh , yes , I 've only just said it . ###Right . 
163836:21	###In other words , erm , whateve the R is greater than C. Do you remember our , our formula for penaltriate benefit of an altruistic act exceeds the cost discounted by the degree of that 's between a half normally . ###The offspring ought to be so put to that 's perfectly true . 
163898:11	###Now , in this case , the , the sacrifice is er , two units of reproductive success , they benefit er B by adding er , one unit of , of reproductive success to it . ###So the cost to me is two , er the benefit to my sibling is one , and the degree of relatedness er , is a half . 
163916:23	###If you think about it , er , there are numbers that will , that will make it work . ###Larger numbers . 
163917:10	###Larger numbers . ###If erm , what would it have to be ? 
163917:44	###Larger numbers . ###If erm , what would it have to be ? 
163917:64	###Larger numbers . ###If erm , what would it have to be ? 
163917:101	###Larger numbers . ###If erm , what would it have to be ? 
163919:18	###It would have to be at least , erm , what would it have to be , it would have to be at least the benefit , yes , the benefit would have to be at least four on the , on the B 's side , in order for that to work . ###Anyway , the these erm , numbers do n't matter , this is just an arbitrary example . 
163925:69	###For them , all other things being equal , they will only be selected to make a sacrifice , where the benefit is twice the cost . ###If you work it out for other relatives , the discrepancy gets even bigger . 
163941:7	###I daresay they intervened to stop the fight . ###Well , what observed exactly the same thing with , with baboons , and said to himself , why are these animals doing this ? 
164017:34	###obviously some variations in ###Oh , absolutely , it would . 
164024:77	###Now , a slight apology to make . ###This , things are n't going very well for me today . 
164040:13	###It 's just my new book . ###I 'm sorry . 
164080:26	###Whether that 's er , I 'm not too sure . ###Erm , anyway , this was when Bullett actually first approached Freud ninetee nineteen hundred and twenty . 
164123:7	###There is a tendency to try and lo er , continually adjust the plain hard facts , without recognizing that they are , they are in fact socially constructed . ###That 's the objective . 
164184:40	###Erm , this is , this is what this school of thought tries to do . ###In the past I used to have a , a class on psycho- history , and I dropped it , and one of the reasons why I dropped it was , the lit a lot of the literary was very poor quality , for a start , and erm , people , er , students , er got that too , and I could n't really blame them . 
164204:28	###Do everybody agree with that ? ###you tell it 
164211:101	###Right , and the background to that of course is , for those of you who may not know , Bullett was I suppose a more junior person in the State Department , when he went to Europe with Woodrow Wilson in nineteen eighteen , and nineteen whenever it was for a peace conference , and Bullett was the only one of the American delegation who resigned and confronted Wilson and said , look , you 've gone back on the fourteen points , you 're not doing what you said you would do . ###How can you go on with this , and Bullett was the only one of them who resigned and went home . 
164226:33	###And er , so Freud and Bullett say , look if Wilson had all the power at the time , and some ways the world in nineteen eighty to twenty was a bit like what it is today , after the collapse of the Soviet Union , really , you really only got one superpower . ###If , if the Americans had all the power , why did Woodrow Wilson just sell out to the Allies ? 
164230:71	###And the answer is , well , if you look at his relationship with his father , er , he was very overawed by his father , he was very passive and submissive towards his father . ###And so there they , they claim that his childhood was relevant , because of this character defect in , in Wilson , his inability to stand up to strong men . 
164289:81	###For example , supposing you erm , this , this , this was used principally in child analysis , which did n't exist before the First World War , it was developed afterwards . ###The problem with child analysis is , children wo n't be associated , that can be made to free associate . 
164319:14	###So that will , corroborating dimension of psychoanalysis , what the patient does for himself and cannot possibly count , and as you rightly say , this leaves analytic biography erm , in a , in a kind of limbo . ###Which is , I really do unsatisfactory . 
164367:48	###Erm , the er , there seems to be kind of latency period when great , innovations in human thought are followed by considerable turbulence and upset , and the figure responsible becomes a kind of er , you know bogey person , that , that , that , that people get , get perhaps that 's certainly true of Darwin , though I think it 's abating now . ###But er , it was certainly true of er , even be true of people like Einstein , you know , the tremendous anti-Einstein ruled particularly in Germany which denounced it . 
164394:7	###Yep . ###That 's right . 
164394:22	###Yep . ###That 's right . 
164503:15	###He would pray for hours and memorize large sections of the Bible . ###His mother remembers his growing talent as a preacher . 
164540:38	###He took things out of context and everything focused on Armageddon , the end of the world , apocalypse . ###Koresh zeroed in on this and tried to bring it closer to where we are to make it more real so it was uppermost in the minds of all his followers . 
164629:129	###Together they had three children , all of them would die in the fire . ###But Koresh believed himself entitled to all the Davidian women . 
164629:168	###Together they had three children , all of them would die in the fire . ###But Koresh believed himself entitled to all the Davidian women . 
164640:24	###So so that if any of the women were pregnant at Mount Carmel , David Koresh was the father . ###Yes because all all Every every man give their wife up . 
164676:107	###Koresh had guns from the beginning and he made his mighty men in to trained marksman . ###His weapons were part of his his message . 
164759:41	###we are all going to die then they all they they that th that they 're going to blow the place up . ###So a mass suicide had erm you know the people were planning a mass suicide in the first few days of the siege . 
164781:12	###Last week 's report would call the entire gassing operation a failure . ###What you had was , F B I agents who were trained to be proactive , to be to do things , to force a conclusion . 
164816:20	###What little remained of victims of the fire was carried away for identification and autopsy . ###The survivors and the government cannot agree about responsibility for their deaths , among them young Cliff , , John , the family , Wayne and four of his children . 
164854:60	###Cripo Rison is a filthy , violent and inaccessible place on the banks of a polluted river . ###It has no hospital , no doctor , and save for the police , no government presence of any kind . 
164930:39	###The mercury caused Manuel sever neurological damage . ###By the time the cause was discovered , and his condition was diagnosed , it was too late . 
165018:71	###But perhaps more fittingly it might commemorate the slaves that died to win it form the Earth . ###This church , Santa Ephygenia was where the African slaves came to worship , to pray to the saint to protect them from the dreadful accidents they faced in the mines . 
165042:9	###Ah well it 'll recover about ninety five percent of the mercury . ###Ah th the problems that the mercury causes are not erm easily seen Immediately seen . 
165047:7	###Recovering the mercury for reuse . ###Why is something so obviously superior not being used ?

165162:7	###it is but ###then again all I turned round and said the bloke that I hit , he said he did n't want to press charges , but then I thought the police can bring out their own prosecution against me but they turned round and said no he does n't want to press charges so we 'll just caution you again . 
165205:83	###We had been told at the time he had been in trouble before . ###We got a letter from the Kent constabulary to say that erm he 'd been let off . 
165311:12	###All of our reparation work is based on the fact that we want people to volunteer to do this work . ###We want them to volunteer to to pay compensation to the offen Er to the victim , because that way we know that they genuinely have concern over what they 've done and they 've faced up their responsibilities . 
165345:9	###Is n't it demoralizing for police officers to see offenders not being prosecuted ? ###It 's very difficult for police officers who are vi visiting victims of crime every day , to see an offender apparently getting away with it . 
165428:9	###Running an airline is an expensive business at the best of times , during a recession it can be a way of using up money really quite quickly , now Virgin 's particular problem was that they began this recession with relatively little in the way of capital and reserves , only about thirty six million in nineteen ninety one . ###So what would have happened last year when they lost over fourteen million pounds ? 
165453:21	###Experience suggests that fares to Hong Kong will fall once Virgin arrives , the danger is that in flying to new places Virgin may reduce the money in it for everybody . ###Virgin will not pull it off if they add too much capacity in too many routes in a very short period of time , because filling capacity is becoming increasingly difficult . 
165501:34	###We , for instance use mid- class on Virgin as well as upper class for some er levels of staff and departments . ###Prices are coming down because discounts are being raised , and it 's got very keen in the market place . 
165502:28	###Prices are coming down because discounts are being raised , and it 's got very keen in the market place . ###So to stay in the frame is Virgin going to have to get in there and 
165518:136	###Erm in my experience erm I do n't think so . ###This flight simulator , Virgin 's lofty lady , is part of another row with B A which is just as important in the battle for business passengers . 
165536:71	###Well it might be that this turns out to be an extremely successful gamble , and Branson has expanded Virgin into a world recovery , or it may be that this airline runs into more serious financial difficulties in the middle of the decade , and it either contracts or it sells out to either an American or a continental European carrier . ###Branson 's already ruled out bank loans , so if there is serious need in future will other Virgin companies fund the airline ? 
165544:30	###Our research suggests that after the sale of the music business to Thorn , the trusts would have got about four hundred and fifty million pounds , even after paying off debts and setting aside money for the initial expansion of Virgin Atlantic , that would still leave about two hundred and fifty million . ###That sounds a lot of money , but it 's not difficult to spend it on an airline . 
165546:13	###Neither Branson nor Virgin Atlantic as a private company , have to make such matters public . ###Using offshore trusts like this is entirely legal , it also frees up extra money , and that may be needed in future . 
165629:14	###He dislikes gaming and was instrumental in triggering the current Federal investigation . ###In California there was no competition , in Maryland there was no competition , every place that G Tec operates , they go in , they hire the highest price talent , they hire the most politically connected talent and they end up getting the contract . 
165634:13	###I I ca n't comment on on comments that you are referencing , however I will say that in Maryland er we displaced an incumbent vendor who had been there a long time , er that vendor was a bit upset as you might imagine with being displaced as a vendor , and in Maryland we had a situation that kind of evolved into the same kind of political row you would expect when a company loses a long time business . ###What are people in Britain to make of this as you come here to present yourselves as a a future er lottery operator ? 
165669:17	###absolutely no chance of detection . ###Right , right . 
165725:25	###What you do not want to be told is erm sorry you 've got to come down in person to our offices , they 're in Southend by the way , erm please bring along your passport certificate , D N A chart , and chit signed by erm the spiritual leaders of at least three merger major world religions . ###Incredibly , impersonation of this sort to get hold of data is not a criminal offense , in this country there is no law as such which makes it illegal to steal information , and the main piece of legislation , the Data Protection Act contains a massive loophole , it only applies to the holders of information not to third parties trying to get their hands on it . 
165735:187	###Now because of course we now have more computers in society than we ever did before , and we do n't have lots of paper files before us inevi invariably , the information is being held upon the computer . ###So we ourselves as members of the public erm we do n't have the formal protection in law , probably , that we should have . 
165772:90	###Worrying for her , and the twenty percent of the population who are ex-directory . ###Like many people , some years ago was troubled by nuisance telephone calls . 
165825:48	###Erm that in fact one of the odd points here is that when a person is convicted , that information is public , but nevertheless as the years go by and indeed er this has been recognized in for instance the rehabilitation of offenders act , it becomes private information and if someone 's looking for a job the fact that he was convicted of an offence many years ago should not be er er relevant . ###Hold on one moment and I 'll just check for you . 
165898:107	###Erm told me that they had a lot of or a lot a number of people ringing purporting to be someone asking for information , and they like to keep a log of these bogus phone calls , I then rang the patients mother and and told her what had happened as quickly as I could . ###What is the thing about this that concerns you most of all ? 
165922:101	###' Fraid not , no . ###Robert is not alone in selling personal information from data banks . 
165936:10	###Right we can supply bank information for instance we can supply you with the balance , erm we should be able to let you know what sort of standing orders there are , erm but that would be charged at an extra rate because ###Yeah . 
165990:39	###And they will never be short of custom until the government acts . ###We asked the Home Office to appear in this program , but they refused , instead they sent us a letter full of encouraging noises about how seriously they took the question of data protection . 
166061:9	###I did sixteen hours every day , six days a week . ###I did n't cut on a Sunday . 
166080:88	###Mm . ###On the roads . 
166085:32	###Well they only started tarmacadam in nineteen thirty six . ###That 's the first they started in Orkney . 
166172:7	###Yeah . ###And it 's never hurt me hard work . 
166442:11	###See in them days of the old steam boats and they came from er from Leith and Aberdeen . ###Mm . 
166522:44	###After the last war you see it was voted dry . ###Did you know that ? 
166583:7	###Yeah . ###Mm . 
166631:9	###Mhm . ###Mm . 
166764:13	###And then when that job finished I started with . ###And they were the firm that were make a tunnel up the hill . 
167112:25	###Both ends you see . ###They were working from both ends . 
167204:45	###Just one lever . ###Forward and start . 
167250:10	###Was that because they were so desperate for it ? ###Yeah 
167371:9	###Mhm . ###Five . 
167460:11	###with the surveyors . ###Oh right . 
167755:25	###No . ###So it would pretty well train you up as engineers by the t by the time you 'd done that then ? 
167760:18	###Not really well we the Blackstone engineer fitting up engines , he stayed with us for a while to show us the ropes like you know . ###Aha . 
167840:10	###Mhm . ###Mhm . 
167851:9	###It 's just crazy . ###Mhm . 
167876:31	###Never you would stay a good bit underneath ###No no . 
167986:15	###Mhm . ###You were telling about that witch story afore , is that something that your father told you ? 
167988:37	###I think it must have been indeed . ###Mhm . . 
168030:33	###With a rowing boat . ###I do n't think he was just too impressed with this set up but it was the only chance anyway so . 
168046:14	###And that was the last he saw of them ? ###And that was the last he saw of them . 
168179:38	###No no . ###Just noise . 
168192:7	###Mhm . ###And they all , they got up in the morning and I was n't home still 
168266:44	###Was your mother involved in that ? ###Well not in the herring fishing but er there was also a a salt fish kind of processing place out in the Hens And me mother work at it and she used to tell us about I supposed they 'll be not rubber boats in that d days . 
168297:7	###What way they dried them , whether it was in the sun or if they 'd anything to dry them with , I do n't ken . ###But they made a great thing with the salt fish . 
168312:44	###And what about your mother , when she worked at the the white fish station ? ###Well i think she 'd go off early in the morning and then would come home about teatime . 
168406:9	###Or whether I got the pinny for nothing , I might have easy . ###Yes ? 
168422:10	###Well when they were tiny anyway . ###Mhm . 
168432:22	###just slim waists waists . ###Big bottoms I always used to say . 
168437:9	###It was a thing made of whale bone that they shoved down side without fastening . ###And there were just as stiff as boards . 
168441:16	###Well did that not do any damage to their ribs then ? ###Well you would think so would n't you but it Nobody ever to say anything about it . 
168441:64	###Well did that not do any damage to their ribs then ? ###Well you would think so would n't you but it Nobody ever to say anything about it . 
168468:11	###About nine o' clock in the morning . ###And we sat in two rows and two horses pulling at us . 
168494:8	###No shelter . ###What happened if it was a pouring day rain ? 
168498:111	###And when I When it was opened out for me going to Deerness , well that was a great event . ###Grandma used to always say , Oh I know she 's on the bus because I can see her here . 
168500:13	###And er when I went to school , Miss the old teacher , she used to take me out , er I used to go to the school ready to go to Deerness , we had to ask out a quarter of an hour early . ###And erm when Because we went the first day of our holidays , right away , to Deerness to my mother 's people . 
168561:17	###Well I never saw the sea on fire but f when we wen went into the sea I mean we were directly beneath the platform , and at that stage I mean the whole platform was on fire . ###And we could n't You could n't just swim on the surface because if you let any part of your body above the water for any length of time , I mean it just burnt . 
168562:45	###And we could n't You could n't just swim on the surface because if you let any part of your body above the water for any length of time , I mean it just burnt . ###So I mean you had to sort of come up , and grab a breath , and go under the water and try and swim away from it . 
168601:130	###Did you find that they were obviously sympathetic to what happened and the spirit in the hospital would have been quite hight really ? ###Aye . 
168605:44	###And er they treated me there I mean I was about two weeks in a room on me own , and taken out then into the main ward for another four weeks . ###And I mean the nurses and everybody , the doctors were really great , and they give us the best of treatment there , and I do n't think you 'll speak to anybody that was in the hospital that 'll say anything differently , they were really great . 
168623:27	###And at the time , I mean it 's half past nine , all work had stopped , mostly at that time of night anyway . ###So I mean there was no poor operating but this is going on , I would n't have thought . 
168646:185	###The government has now said that they 're going to order oil companies to install shut off valves below platforms . ###Do you feel that that would have solved the situation on Piper Alpha altogether or how far would it have gone to perhaps lessening the the blow of the the occasion ? 
168654:27	###I think that and I mean you go with the sort of attitude , that lightning will never strike twice in the same place , but then again I mean who knows ? ###Clearly it was a time when so many people were lost , and it was the world 's worst oil rig disaster . 
168654:63	###I think that and I mean you go with the sort of attitude , that lightning will never strike twice in the same place , but then again I mean who knows ? ###Clearly it was a time when so many people were lost , and it was the world 's worst oil rig disaster . 
168659:84	###It is difficult to to come to terms with the fact that I mean it 's people that you 've worked with for a week , at a time and I mean for three and a half years every second week you 're working with that guys in a confined space , you get to know them really well . ###And I mean it is your sort of second home , and the guys that you work with every every week , I mean sort of become , I mean it 's a bit of a cliche to say , but I mean part of a family that you living out there that you live with out there and it is a real I mean when you think of the number that was lost , I mean there were a lot of close friends involved in it . 
168677:55	###And er the amount of money that 's in the appeal fund , whereas it shows a great feeling of warmth from the general public , I think I do n't I mean there 's people dying all over the world , even at home here in Orkney , there 's people that dying , they do n't receive any great compensation for that . ###And I mean I think that if it was spread more I mean if if if people locally gave more to to bereaved in their own areas , I mean it would go down a lot more good there . 
168687:106	###I mean I 'm going on the on the opinion that full function 'll come back and I 'll be able to do any work that I was doing before , and there 'll be no change at all . ###The only problem is with er the skin grafts and that . 
168740:12	###Firstly , Jack , coxswain , since nineteen seventy . ###Are you going to be sorry to see that boat go ? 
168797:60	###Angus . ###And my thanks to all connected with the Longhope lifeboat , for my day out . 
168800:42	###We now have fifteen men who have past the medical exam and the board of trade eyesight test and are now fully enrolled lifeboat crew . ###There is one or two not quite completed training yet . 
168807:42	###What particular memories have you got of this lifeboat ? ###My memories of this boat would be mainly the the big rescue she did and the Taft Tail of swanal Aberdeen trawler Ross Turn . 
168870:55	###Mhm . ###Oh very much a very much a very much a skilled job you know ? 
168871:7	###Oh very much a very much a very much a skilled job you know ? ###You wo n't get a prize unless you 're up to it , The er the ploughing has to look professional . 
168890:11	###The girls used to join in the in the party afterwards , you know ? ###But no They did n't take part in the event really . 
168897:9	###Do n't see much of that happening actually . ###It 's a very strong local tradition and I think it 'll stay that way . 
168920:53	###I ca n't remember . ###They could have been mind you . 
168948:33	###An and that had stopped by World War Two would you say ? ###Oh aye , aye , stopped before World War Two I think .

168988:9	###That 's like a a sort of electrically driven timer . ###Yes , that 's what it is , and in the grammar school they had biology wanted to have plants growing in the dark but provide a light for them .

169042:15	###Yes , well , it 's at at an odd angle , you noticed th that because we are in latitude fifty nine , so the centre of this has to look at the pole star . ###It 's an astronomical device then , yes I see .

169138:15	###I got a porthole from the Fulforn when it was being sent off for being scrapped . ###And it was about ten inches in diameter .

169452:49	###And er there was only the workhouse at that they could go . ###And I oh I fought hard I never wanted a baby to be born in the wok house cos the word workhouse to me in the old it was a terrible name . 
169460:54	###Things have changed , things have improved you see . ###What did Anglesey people think about the workhouse ? 
169506:9	###I was years without a telephone in Rhos- y-Bol . ###How did people get in touch with you ? 
169507:7	###How did people get in touch with you ? ###Well they had to fetch me . 
169513:7	###And then people were making use of that . ###But the post office people did n't like it again . 
169516:17	###People left messages but that was n't right again . ###So they did n't like telephones . 
169518:24	###Then er the county then had to give us telephones . ###But really it was it years without . 
169523:40	###Bleeding you know what do you call . ###What do you call it now . 
169524:10	###What do you call it now . ###It was the babies you see that they were Well you had to have the doctor to you .

170049:81	###Oh yes yes . ###Yes . 
170050:30	###Yes . ###Erm remember the hay we would be turning it w with pitchforks you know , and erm not a well goo drying day but you had to risk turning it and hoping that it 'd be dry but er it would be raining again the following day . 
170063:14	###Yes . ###Yes . 
170064:33	###Yes . ###And another job we had to do erm especially on a rainy day , ready for the worst .

170102:27	###And then how would you do that then ? ###Well after you know the the stack would be a bit untidy straight after and after it had cooled .

170233:29	###There were two blades on that , cutting them into into round slices about oh three quarters of an inch thick . ###Cutting the that was for for the or the dairy cows . 
170236:130	###How was the slicer powered then ? ###Oh erm with with a We had a er erm a a paraffin driven er a Crossley , a big oil engine with two big flywheels to it and a big piston like a bucket . 
170240:48	###And er eventually he came er an engine which er there were some which started on petrol and then you turned on to to paraffin but most of the work , just going on petrol , with a plug and a magneto . ###You used to start that with a handle of course . 
170240:81	###And er eventually he came er an engine which er there were some which started on petrol and then you turned on to to paraffin but most of the work , just going on petrol , with a plug and a magneto . ###You used to start that with a handle of course . 
170257:12	###It pushed the strap , from one pulley to another , to the loose pulley or the f fixed pulley on the end of the long shafting . ###Why was the the chaffer considered the most dangerous then ? 
170268:70	###Oh . ###For for for grinding the oats . 
170309:34	###Yes yes yes when when when I grew older , of course it took all the men When er you know one would b the the whole lot would be going together you know . ###The erm the the crusher , the hopper was fixed underneath the granary and then there 'd be a little trap-door in the floor or a granary , right above and you could er shovel the the corn , the oats down into . 
170309:123	###Yes yes yes when when when I grew older , of course it took all the men When er you know one would b the the whole lot would be going together you know . ###The erm the the crusher , the hopper was fixed underneath the granary and then there 'd be a little trap-door in the floor or a granary , right above and you could er shovel the the corn , the oats down into . 
170317:42	###Y y y y y ###they in fact involved quite a lot 
170379:13	###But she preferred to stay up here with her family and her friends . ###So I then told her that if we were gonna stay here , the chances of me getting a job were very slim . 
170417:15	###Obviously there was new school clothes that was needed . ###Erm the mot pressure erm from that for that sort of stuff was was came form me . 
170423:58	###I always made sure my daughter had new clothes to go to school with like you know . ###Not just but in g in good order all the way through the year . 
170476:21	###Yes ? ###Erm not a not a a good thing to do when I when I said necessary , without it a lot of people would er I do n't know er aggravate I do n't want to make it say more drastic than it is . 
170502:14	###You said that in the nature of things you 've always needed the money almost as of yesterday . ###Yeah . 
170551:23	###I 've never heard of anyone working the hours I worked but then again I was living there and that was my disadvantage . ###He could get me any time . 
170571:15	###Erm well we sold things . ###Did you ? 
170578:10	###Erm we 've sold endless tape recorders and Hi Fi 's . ###You name it , we 've sold it . 
170603:31	###Erm it it could have been a problem if we 'd have both been so me materialistic that we wanted to keep everything we 'd got hold of you know . ###But we knew that it was probably inevitable . 
170603:50	###Erm it it could have been a problem if we 'd have both been so me materialistic that we wanted to keep everything we 'd got hold of you know . ###But we knew that it was probably inevitable . 
170607:86	###Everything else would go too . ###Erm but one thing I would say , is that erm we did n't go into long term erm debt to get things like three pieces and and bedroom suite and things like this . 
170612:60	###We had so many conversations about about economy and all this er ca n't really remember . ###I think it was mentioned once . 
170616:109	###Er being on the dole and having friends who were long term on the dole , we tend to buy from each other a lot . ###Ah . 
170630:81	###So you know . ###And he 'd bought it off his friend who 'd paid fifty for it . 
170662:18	###to things materialistic , no . ###Do you think the blow such as it was in s s selling something , was it would it have been softened because you s there was a you knew the people you were selling to . 
170675:20	###So you could be right I do n't know . ###I do n't really know . 
170708:7	###Erm the only thing I 've I 've never considered buying hot is camera gear . ###Er because the I say photography is er something I 'm gonna ca continue with and if I start buying hot gear then I ca n't use my equipment where and when I 'd want to . 
170721:7	###Erm he got his own interest er and in the end he decided on all his own stuff like you know . ###I suppo I suppose it was cheaper in a way because erm he found himself in the shop a lot more , he could n't afford the staff that he had , he had used to have two people working for him . 
170821:111	###A great hope . ###I 'm hoping to do it . 
170879:10	###I am totally convinced that the people in Holyhead want you to put things on , pick them up at the door , drop them off , teach them how to do it er and drop them back again . ###And that 's the only way they consider going . 
170880:18	###And that 's the only way they consider going . ###We 've had to cancel five classes that we set up erm in November . 
170981:13	###Unless it was out and out screaming , Let 's kill Thatcher , I would n't even notice it I do n't think . ###So you 're asking the wrong person I 'm afraid for that one . 
170983:13	###You you 'd have to be very er very hard line for me to notice it . ###Ah yes . 
171020:13	###One is the need for applications . ###Traditionally database management systems have been excellent at decision support . 
171075:64	###So we 'll have a single S twelve query server , a relational database management system , which can be accessed from the applications on the database . ###Now there 's a number of disadvantages to this traditional approach . 
171080:35	###But also the database is passive , it never knows which client is going to communicate with it next . ###It takes requests as and when they turn up and the server deals with them and res returns the results back to the client that requested that information . 
171082:88	###But the S Q L code which is sent to it has to be interpreted when it gets to the server machine , and we all know the difference between compiled and interpreted code . ###But the real disadvantage to this approach is in terms of the control of maintenance because as we 've already said you 'll have done analysis and design on these elementary but fundamental business functions which reside inside the application . 
171229:100	###They will be different in terms of the sort of interaction they expect to have with computer depending on whether they 're data entry people or management users and maybe some of our users are people in the street , our customers er who who will increasingly become users of systems themselves . ###So whereas in the past we may have been able to think of single user types and single solutions to meet those users . 
171241:22	###And we can impose solutions on our on our users , you know , You users can all have P Cs , you can all have erm dumb terminals . ###we can decide what you want to use . 
171254:13	###In the real world systems and networks fail so there are times when our systems are not available . ###And that may be okay in a departmental level but when I had an integrated global enterprise operating in integrated fashion around an integrated I T system then clearly I cannot afford to allow a failure to actually paralyze the system . 
171259:10	###And the final point is that vendors will not be able to solve your problem . ###The decision you make today about which vendor you go with and which technology you go with may be the right decision today and yet may may be the wrong decision tomorrow . 
171260:21	###The decision you make today about which vendor you go with and which technology you go with may be the right decision today and yet may may be the wrong decision tomorrow . ###You only have to look back over what 's er happened over the last few years in terms of for example O S Two , Microsoft Windows , a variety of Unix , and you 'll see that technologies will come along and however sound a decision you make at one point in time the market circumstances and potentially mean that what was right for you then not the right . 
171269:74	###In fact I 've often said that if you show me a system which does n't have a performance problem then you 've shown me a system which is a failure . ###Because successful systems attract more use and more workload . 
171275:9	###For every dollar you spend on software , he alleges that you 'll spend between one and a half and two dollars simply on getting that software to work the other software you have . ###In other words perhaps fifty percent of the spending on I T is wasted in inverted commas because it 's simply concerned with tying together what you already have with the new stuff that you want to integrate in . 
171275:77	###For every dollar you spend on software , he alleges that you 'll spend between one and a half and two dollars simply on getting that software to work the other software you have . ###In other words perhaps fifty percent of the spending on I T is wasted in inverted commas because it 's simply concerned with tying together what you already have with the new stuff that you want to integrate in . 
171298:47	###We were conscious as well that in venturing into this brave new Unix world that accountants being fairly boring individuals , I mean how many accountants do I have in the audience today ? ###I can say that reasonable safely and I can apologize to those people who put their hands up , by saying that I too am c am an accountant by background , and it 's fairly brave of me to admit that in front of so many I T people . 
171299:9	###I can say that reasonable safely and I can apologize to those people who put their hands up , by saying that I too am c am an accountant by background , and it 's fairly brave of me to admit that in front of so many I T people . ###But we were conscious that an accounting system maintains the corporate financial information and we must protect the integrity of that information . 
171314:13	###Well we should use X-networking standards , and at the moment if a network complies to T C P I P as the communications protocol then we can work with that . ###And we 'll actually look in a minute or two at the different aspects of the application , the different layers of the product , and how those communicate . 
171354:68	###We see an awful lot of people have got a tremendous investment in traditional character cell terminals and by a character cell terminal I mean a dumb terminal of twenty four lines of eighty characters . ###Erm I if I was talking to an audience in the United States , you 'd probably have a somewhat different approach cos over there they seem to throw their desktop devices away every two or three years and replace them with brand new technology . 
171377:119	###But we do need to consider a couple of other areas . ###One which I 've defined there with the word views . 
171382:7	###Not an American product which is being bent to their requirements , not an English product which is being bent to their requirements . ###And there are immediately two areas which are very obvious and straightforward , those of currency and language . 
171521:17	###John 's already stolen my thunder on the straw poll erm that I was going to do but suffice to say that we normally do that at these types of seminars and there 's always a few people in the room who put their hands up and say they 've got more than ten data sources in their organization . ###And if truth be known there are many more in that audience . 
171522:7	###And if truth be known there are many more in that audience . ###In the real world we have to recognize that we cannot convert customers to only use the database . 
171525:62	###solution is Omni SQL Gateway no other product delivers the level of transparency that Omni provides . ###Omni SQL Gateway provides complete location and vendor transparency . 
171572:35	###Well we 've already talked briefly and we 've seen a video about Gain Multimedia and how that might enable us to address application requirements in a different way . ###With applications that actually look like the way you do business . 
171665:36	###Er some of the new products er you talk we talked about like Navigation Server we will be working with N C R on precisely we 'll be shipping those products . ###Yes 
171893:9	###And er we used to look if we could see some on the side of the mountains from the distances you could pick it out with a pick them out with er with this telescope it was a heck of a good telescope , aye . ###It was so good , this telescope , we had , when I was watching the pheasants , in the field , I used to be there all day for the the carrion crows would come along do you see . 
171987:31	###And erm we used to help er in the woodlands then , used to give us a help . ###And they 'd be all down in the cellar do you see . 
171991:18	###And hang them up in the cellar all night . ###Because there was two or three rooms there do you see , a proper place for hanging up . 
172040:11	###Aye aye . ###Two guns of course . 
172043:9	###Keep two cartridges in your hand all the time , and then as soon as you 'd handed your gun , and you were taking the other one , and he was the empty one . ###They used to swing out themselves do you see , just open trigger handle for the barrel to open , they used to spring out , and then put the two new ones in you see and close it straight off . 
172072:7	###Of er blocks . ###Er every week . 
172279:9	###An er they were coming in er the Norways , they were coming in bundles of a hundred . ###The being that they were taller , and older , they were coming in bundles of about fifty do you see . 
172279:37	###An er they were coming in er the Norways , they were coming in bundles of a hundred . ###The being that they were taller , and older , they were coming in bundles of about fifty do you see . 
172313:14	###No no . ###That 's all on the side . 
172333:7	###But as soon as you cut the the oak trees , down , and the ash , they would catch the wind then and scorch do you see . ###Aye aye . 
172377:40	###And they reckon it was the best class of of er Douglas fir they ever had . ###Aye aye . 
172417:30	###And I thought Oh yes , yes . ###And fetch water for them to wash and that . 
172435:7	###Oh they were n't blacksmiths in in the ordinary sense of the word , they were n't quarry blacksmiths as such because they were more or less engine smiths you see . ###Yeah . 
172455:56	###No at least a couple of dozen , working at that time . ###So they were kept really busy . 
172458:151	###They used to take the hooks off the wagon you see , there were two hooks , one each end of the the wagons that they used on the incline . ###And then they were put they were er put er in the fire wire brushed and all that and looked and inspected for cracks you see . 
172505:106	###You know , in actual fact , one of the men working in the in the in the carpenter 's shop . ###He was he 'd been hurt that was the usu that 's why some of the men did . 
172505:122	###You know , in actual fact , one of the men working in the in the in the carpenter 's shop . ###He was he 'd been hurt that was the usu that 's why some of the men did . 
172506:7	###He was he 'd been hurt that was the usu that 's why some of the men did . ###He 'd been er had an accident in the quarry some time ago and he was working in the helping as a mate or something in the carpenter 's shop and he he must have been h must have had his hands in our pile of finished products and er Well partly finished products and er he er he was caught one of the cos er these castings there was a an edge to them you know , the joint of the the mould that came together sort of thing . 
172518:9	###. Erm yes well th that 's the only erm casting you know , that we did . ###bearings for for you know , shafts mills really the old type crushers in mills that They were really old fashioned crushers . 
172518:24	###. Erm yes well th that 's the only erm casting you know , that we did . ###bearings for for you know , shafts mills really the old type crushers in mills that They were really old fashioned crushers . 
172518:41	###. Erm yes well th that 's the only erm casting you know , that we did . ###bearings for for you know , shafts mills really the old type crushers in mills that They were really old fashioned crushers . 
172520:107	###And they had to be the bearings had to be either you had to have a s a set ready at all times sort of thing you know so a spare set . ###Erm yeah oh the bearings we we they usually were bought from They were American er brass bearings , huge brass things you know . 
172534:79	###They they did n't they they just cast them roughly . ###Well not roughly I mean they I mean they did n't sort of finish them off w wherever they was s sent to in whatever the firm I I I do n't know the name of the firm , I was I was n't involved in did n't bother as long as the job was done . 
172610:64	###Never been late in my life . ###Erm the erm Course the the blasting was on at nine . 
172617:56	###So nine o' clock break . ###make the tea , go round the Used to take about three helpings of tea to make the the the bottle . 
172637:17	###I d I would n't know . ###I think my my starting salary at fifteen was seven and six . 
172642:40	###Plus er going up going to you know , all that . ###Sos there was n't much left of the seven and six to kee feed me and all that . 
172642:76	###Plus er going up going to you know , all that . ###Sos there was n't much left of the seven and six to kee feed me and all that . 
172649:34	###And er the cook I think the boys e had about er started on ten shillings you know , ten shillings a week . ###Erm but er that was this boy 's job and then he used to er you know , scrub the tables in the rest room and of course boil the water first thing in the morning . 
172654:15	###And a couple of young clerks , that 's where they bred their clerks for the future use sort of thing you know . ###I see . 
172671:50	###Sort of Oh we used to risk our necks walking across the ruddy this mill was a bit of a wreck actually and we used to go playing in places where we should n't have really . ###Anyway , that 's beside the point . 
172698:88	###It 's easy enough to dirt . ###That was the method that we used and I did n't I never heard I did n't hear of dermatitis or anything until well twenty five years afterwards . 
172785:45	###Firms in North Wales here along the coast which came after the war of course . ###Can you sort of amplify that if you can ? 
172795:7	###I see . ###They just r r rammed their way and you had an man the they had a man they tell me I I 've never seen one But erm this was as far as I can make out er by the They had a man standing by you see with a a spanner and er gave it a quarter turn every time it hammered the the drill sort of hit the rock , went into the and hammered . 
172889:14	###ledgers that are now on the archives could be l placed down there and fascinated me because he could add a column of pounds , shillings and pence , he 'd take his three fingers at the bottom of the long ledger column , and as fast practically like a computer , would add to the top and then put it in pencil . ###And then And never made a mistake of course , he tried to teach me but it was just a waste of time . 
172891:8	###But anyway I did have to do some of them . ###But my basic job would be kind of a dogsbody for everybody . 
172891:39	###But anyway I did have to do some of them . ###But my basic job would be kind of a dogsbody for everybody . 
172932:16	###two . ###And there was the best one of course , your cousin was able to use . 
172961:15	###And then you mailed the letter or delivered the letter or whatever was necessary . ###Yeah . 
172971:10	###Yes . ###and quotations on that . 
172971:29	###Yes . ###and quotations on that . 
172974:28	###That was one of the orders , there was a little bathroom down in the in the first floor and the thing that they must not get , was your hands dirty . ###Now old wore a black thing afore his shirt , now because he was with ink all over him you see , but he he he did n't do this .

172975:67	###Now old wore a black thing afore his shirt , now because he was with ink all over him you see , but he he he did n't do this . ###That was my job so therefore my hands had to be constantly clean and that 's not easy for a seventeen year old to keep his hands clean all the time but I had to . 
173014:12	###Yeah . ###thing and cracked it . 
173015:10	###thing and cracked it . ###So naturally I had to get it with and it was heavier th I do n't know how much it weighed , I I I got it by the way , in my barn in farm in Indiana , one of the last relics of Brothers . 
173018:12	###To have them er weld it . ###Cos it was cracked , it was useless of course . 
173019:35	###Cos it was cracked , it was useless of course . ###And and I had to pay for it of course . 
173020:11	###And and I had to pay for it of course . ###Now I was making ten shillings a week , and I had to pay a penny toll every day to come to from office . 
173023:10	###And occasionally if I was really flush , I 'd buy a little cake for another tuppence you see . ###Could n't afford to go to they was too expensive .

173046:75	###I think I think there was som some sent to Chester for example , I think they were doing something in the cathedral in Chester . ###Mm . 
173065:47	###They 're one of the fine universities of Virginia . ###But anyway , some lawyer I think in New York , working for Rockefeller Brothers , sent a piece of slate to my Uncle Jonathan , asking him could he tell , what quarry in Wales , this particular tile had come from . 
173090:8	###I I remember working on some of the of the paperwork involved in it . ###We had a you know there was a lot of paperwork involved . 
173090:28	###I I remember working on some of the of the paperwork involved in it . ###We had a you know there was a lot of paperwork involved . 
173096:9	###all very high mucky muck stuff and they would n't trust me with anything but at least I did the copying work on it . ###Yeah . 
173201:48	###I remember for example having to to to send reams of letters to architects ###Mm . 
173227:30	###You know , the nonconformist was anathema . ###So Lloyd George as the story goes , advised them to go there with their father and take some crowbars with them , and not to break down the gate , to break down the wall , and take their minister with them and bury their father . 
173245:11	###Who was a second or third officer on the Lusitania . ###And he ended up as the port captain for Cunard in New York . 
173252:58	###And erm my my Mrs Jonathan , my aunt Auntie Bessie , invariably in Porthmadog , went to call on the families of people who 'd been lost , as my mother did in in we lost you see in fifty two men killed in world war one . ###And er I remember one one day , there was nineteen of them . 
173353:33	###Now Statue of Liberty of course is in in the news . ###And when I was when I got to New York , I was met by two first cousins from two different families er Bert who 's er er nephew of my my mother 's sister Laura Anne in in New York , and another one , William who 'd been very successful vice president of or something .

173384:43	###Yeah . ###But anyway er New York in those days , first time I ever remember , I ran into the flappers you see . 
173453:43	###Perhaps to the beach here , or passing the time . ###Cos I had you see . . 
173466:20	###And er I joined this territorials they come and then I joined them , and we went to Camp Parkgate for a fortnight . ###We were we had n't been home a couple of two or three weeks then the big war started , nineteen fourteen . 
173468:13	###Fourth of August so we had to go see . ###We were belonging to the territorials then . 
173471:9	###And and in Wales yeah we forget where we were there . ###But we went to had a lot of joi jointer then joiners men . 
173538:7	###No I they 're in the archive ###Aye my father 's leaning on the bridge like that . 
173674:7	###You said that erm or you implied that it was important to stow the c the erm slates v v very carefully . ###Oh Oh yes . 
173720:11	###Oh aye all through the war . ###on August the fourth nineteen fourteen . 
173723:53	###My mother was sitting here on a chair yeah , when I come home from there . ###Oh Dick , she says to me , she called she called me Dick and I used to tease her . 
173826:44	###Yeah . ###From ? 
173833:77	###Cos I had an uncle there . ###And my grandmother used to live on the beach there . 
174024:73	###Well they say it 'll come out like that see . ###Mm . 
174057:7	###That 's where she was . ###Mm . 
174094:7	###Well I 'd been on the Menai Suspension Bridge before . ###Aye they were repairing it then . 
174107:12	###Yeah . ###To put them down . 
174168:8	###And with a frying pan full of some stuff there , very nice though . ###And he come there and luckily he went on top of the table to lie down . 
174256:9	###I reckon was n't it . ###Everywhere was going yes . 
174321:9	###And I was there till nineteen sixty when I retired . ###I see . 
174338:166	###That was to convert from from D C to A C. to bring it er from A C to D C to bring er bring it into what the town was er being constructed for . ###I see . 
174524:23	###Continuous , they never stopped . ###It 's a public what they call er Mr here used to say . 
174760:22	###Us some used to come and take o take houses o down west shore , take take these houses for a month , bring their own er bring their own servants and er own footmen and I do n't know what besides . ###Oh they did that the er there were er lot of wealthy families used to come here . 
174801:15	###Ho ###The nearly fifty in that orchestra . 
174849:28	###He wrote this on p . ###And I had that in my pocket for years . 
174865:26	###No I er I said er if I 'd have kept that postcard it there were his address on you see I could have f I could have found him , but no . ###But you know when I when I c last time I came from France and I came a came across the widest part of the channel er I got done once I had a B written on my board and then they come and crossed it out . 
174919:23	###I used to like riding . ###I did that . 
174952:52	###No they 're very er . ###Er the er of course it is more or less Welsh district than they 're they 're very well attended is the Welsh churches . 
174954:50	###And the er there 's there 's er one one of them two of them had to close down . ###Er close and then they moved to er help other churches you see . 
175085:31	###I do n't anyway this is just one of the highlights of what has been two marvellous days at the Mackeson meeting sponsored of course by Whitbread and the big race today is the fifty thousand pound Mackeson Gold Cup confirming fifteen runners over two and a half miles . ###Panto Prince is out and General Pershing is now new favourite and clear favourite . 
175097:24	###Well let 's see what we can oppose him with . ###Bradley Star is a very nice horse he 's a classy performer this one , Josh Gifford 's horses are in tremendous form and I was talking to the man who who rides him Deckland Murphy he 's my next door neighbour he thinks he 'll run a big race . 
175103:118	###yeah ###he 's only once been beaten at Cheltenham . 
175115:62	###But er it does n't look like a steeplechase but it is in fact ###a two mile steeplechase the Galway Plate and General Idea running really well from and Express but the ground 's the problem . 
175308:28	###Admittedly they 're a little bit less streamlined but if you 're going to say that that makes a serious difference ###but what 's the difference in the courses 
175311:53	###true ###The tracks in America okay we go over there and we say they 're tight they 're quite difficult to ride . 
175456:9	###But with fourteen minutes gone Derby moved the ball slickly from Forsyth to Harts and on to Paul for a measured finish . ###Two nil and the completely in charge . 
175470:54	###It would 've been a bit dodgy at Wellford Road let alone London Road . ###But it took a couple of goes to get the ball in the net . 
175524:37	###And in addition to that of course we cover the safety aspects that are required up at Molyneux . ###Which is as important as preparing for disorder itself . 
175524:62	###And in addition to that of course we cover the safety aspects that are required up at Molyneux . ###Which is as important as preparing for disorder itself . 
175578:71	###What sort of offences were there ? ###Erm people spitting er obscenities , obscene gestures , er we 've had two assaults er but they have been relatively minor assaults as far as we 're concerned . 
175580:26	###There is a violent undercurrent in our society which has got nothing at all to do with football and where football must n't be complacent is to provide the opportunities at its matches to allow that undercurrent of violence to manifest itself . ###I think the game I think the game has done well in tackling that problem but I do n't think we as a society have done very well in tackling it in the country at large . 
175607:33	###There was some disgruntlement because what happened they tr they changed the rules . ###Now the first time they tried to change them in May they lost the vote , the women , to increase it from three to four . 
175623:15	###Do you think the danger in positive discrimination is that er it 's implying that women ca n't compete on equal terms with the men in the first place ? ###No I do n't think that is the problem . 
175630:31	###But we all we can do is reflect the position of women in society , and I do not think that what 's we 're about and I do not think it 's what the parliamentary Labour party . ###No it was n't a backlash against women . 
175645:23	###In the European Parliament for example we do have a nursery we have child-care facilities for seventy children which you do n't have in the House of Commons . ###Perhaps . 
175652:7	###Lady Thatcher 's been on the road promoting her book and a couple of nights ago she was in Birmingham at a dinner hosted by the Birmingham Post . ###There is of course nothing new in the battle by memoir . 
175657:36	###That 's not to say however that occasionally you do n't get throwbacks to a gentler more courteous age . ###For example Alec Hume 's memoirs were described them as this little book about fishing , a beautiful evocation of a countryman in Downing Street who would always rather have been with his fly on the river Tweed on the Scottish Borders . 
175666:10	###What would you say have been the successes and the flops of more recent times ? ###The ones that have done well in publishing terms quite rightly I think are those who have pl been plainly written by the person concerned , above all Dennis Healey and also Roy Jenkins . 
175750:11	###The boys were waiting to cross the road here and the horse came down this lane , galloped straight across the road in front of the traffic then onto the pavement , tried to jump over the boys and jumped onto the boys . ###And Colin finished up just down here on the pavement and Keith maybe a few yards further down er with very bad injuries . 
175793:53	###And as a result the amount of coal produced by Britain 's deep mines has fallen substantially . ###The government says these are the harsh economic realities faced by the industry . 
175906:12	###I I 's thinking well this long would make the blinking situation worse and we 're trying to resolve it . ###I said , No I do n't . 
175999:45	###Yes . ###I remember Glyn and the kids were very young I think some of the were born in Blaenau erm and they were dismantling an old quarry at there his brother W R from Harlech had bought it usa like a machinery merchant and Glyn then borrowed a lot of tools off me for dismantling it then we started we we 'd done a lot off and on together we 'd been in er I enjoyed working with him , he was the type of man very hard worker himself but he wanted his pound of flesh . 
176015:69	###But as soon as Tom came back they did n't want to you know . ###So they 'd been playing cat and mouse game and er it has n't paid off you know . 
176046:44	###Right they 've er they 've been preaching against Spanish slates . ###Well I 've seen Spanish slates in the quarry . 
176068:9	###Yes erm how can I say , we were invited Manchester University er to speak at dinner time , four of us went up and I was nominated as the speaker . ###I made a bit of a speech and all that and er like a clever dick I went without me glasses . 
176069:13	###I made a bit of a speech and all that and er like a clever dick I went without me glasses . ###So I had to make the speech best as I could and it went down all right I think . 
176090:177	###So anyway , he erm had his say quite a long story and er the Chairman turned round all of a sudden and he s he could n't say the Chairman er said call him cos that 's what we call him and he said er he said erm would you like to come back to the rostrum again and he said erm you were explaining to me about an accident you had in the quarry in quarry , erm some years back and he said , I 'd like you to explain to these people . ###So said to me yes carry on you 're doing fine you know and he went up and er well he did n't know how to start the poor fellow doing smashing and he said , Well erm imagine this hall , he said , this hall we 're in now as a big cavern underground . 
176091:17	###So said to me yes carry on you 're doing fine you know and he went up and er well he did n't know how to start the poor fellow doing smashing and he said , Well erm imagine this hall , he said , this hall we 're in now as a big cavern underground . ###Well then er quite , so he said erm it was all quiet and I looked up into the darkness and I said that the old fellow had gone and he litten his fuse and there was me there I could see the sparks in the darkness and I was way twenty feet below him and he must have whatsit . 
176097:27	###And the next thing he know he remembers he 's hanging upside down with a half feet around his the chain had slipped ' t was round his ankle and he was hanging upside down in the dark twenty feet from the ground . ###And of course the old fellow 's holes went out but they went right over him nev never a scratch on him . 
176104:24	###Somebody want us to go to Newark , I think that is by Nottingham is n't it , to speak there . ###And now there was a chap on the phone last night he want to go to Valley and I was trying to tell the bloke who who he between doing pickets and trying to keep count and er . 
176144:100	###So we 're losing . ###So really we 've got to erm give in right in our estimation they were wrong . 
176163:31	###Well I said I ca n't say I wish it was over tomorrow . ###But if it was over tomorrow I said it 's still left our lads in quite er hole financially , and we shall still need that . 
176203:9	###We had diphtheria see . ###I had it first . 
176204:27	###I had it first . ###And we must have caught it from there . 
176213:60	###Mrs had a sister and er a brother . ###And his sister was in Texas and the brother was in Philadelphia . 
176251:42	###And of course they have gardens and then they have apple trees and things like that . ###Well , I said , I 'll give it a chance . 
176321:14	###And of course some you used to have points to get sweets and things like that . ###And I carried a very very big stock of sweets because there was such a variety . 
176322:7	###And I carried a very very big stock of sweets because there was such a variety . ###And everybody , you had to keep to suit every customer if you wanted to make a business . 
176323:34	###And everybody , you had to keep to suit every customer if you wanted to make a business . ###You had to do that . 
176457:9	###I see . ###And then it 's the window 's high from the f floor . 
176466:51	###And the bungalow 's next door is n't it . ###The that came after . 
176537:31	###Mr now . ###And er he went to him so he went to speak to this woman about the thing and she was member of the Co-op see . 
176549:34	###So he stopped and then it fell , and it fell short of the hundred pound they wanted . ###They had a reserve price on it . 
176551:14	###So we paid that because they wanted and then we had to pay for stock . ###There was n't much stock there though . 
176552:37	###There was n't much stock there though . ###All rubbish , we had to throw it . 
176565:34	###No I do n't think so , no . ###Mm . 
176567:13	###Well er it would in a way because you 'd have to pay interest on what you were borrowing would n't you ? ###Yes . 
176568:7	###Yes . ###Oh yes you have to pay now a mortgage wo n't you . 
176598:43	###Mhm . ###But I think Oh he was a all nice and everything er you know . 
176640:6	###Er and then er I was going to make a v nice flat and I was going to build a warehouse and things to But I did n't got to do it . ###I came home . 
176647:7	###O=only the the only thing was that you had n't got enough room to display everything that you could stock , is n't it . ###You know what I mean . 
176671:14	###W Yeah . ###And they used to say , some of them used to say er , If there 's anything you ca n't get , if you haven you ca n't get for us or have n't got , er just let us know and we 'll bring it with us . 
176723:34	###Or to bring anything back . ###But some do n't bother do they ? 
176810:15	###It was you know , I did like that . ###I enjoyed serving better than anything . 
176839:28	###So you maintained a direct link between you and the manufacturer or or the distributor . ###Yes more of them yes . 
176877:29	###We always used to have the old ones out . ###And before Easter , after Christmas , I used to start buying extra of things that kept . 
176942:68	###Mm . ###You could see through them you know . 
176944:11	###Oh yes , you got to know th That 's one thing in business that 's one thing you have to do . ###At least I think so at any rate . 
176995:10	###Who was who you were able to erm if you like , if you were y who you were able to t t teach and show this sort of enthusiasm . ###Yes they were all there you know , everyone of them you did . 
177034:27	###But we used to clean the shop ready for the morning . ###Always ready to open . 
177082:11	###A government that believes we are out of recession , but is still making Britain the Taiwan of Europe . ###This Union needs no convincing , nor does the Labour Party , of the need to retain the Wages Council . 
177097:7	###This government is intent on isolating Britain in Europe as the only country with no minimum guaranteed wages , and a producer for low cost products . ###In Scotland a quarter of a million of the workf workers would be affected by this Tor er , sorry , this Tory policy , mainly part-time working women and ethnic groups . 
177110:36	###Instead of dealing with problems of low paid and increasing the number of inspectors , the government is going to abolish them completely . ###Congress , as the majority of low paid workers are women , the abolition of Wages Councils is direct discrimination . 
177116:7	###Millions of others will be openly exploited by unscrupulous employers . ###Th the economy can only suffer shortages and low productivity as a result of poverty pay . 
177150:8	###However , if the Wages Councils were abolished there would be no guarantee that a negotiated minimum rate would be applied . ###The result could be pay freezes , even pay cuts . 
177194:20	###And at the same time the income divide between the top twenty percent of men and the bottom twenty percent is now greater than it were hundred years ago . ###Shame . 
177241:7	###Many more workers will be forced , by low pay , to claim benefits to make up their income , when they want to earn a decision wage . ###That also means we will be subsidizing bad employers through our taxes and the fiddling factory owners will undermine the decent conditions we have fought for over the years . 
177313:47	###Probably the largest attack is centred on the deduction from wages or check-off legislation . ###This is not unusual these days from employees while blaming the economic situation to refuse an increase in pay . 
177319:60	###Colleagues , this composite calls for the immobilization of the union 's many resources to campaign against the vicious and unnecessary legislation . ###It refers to G M , G M B sponsored MPs and MEPs . 
177439:11	###The correction was printed in a small two centimetre box hidden in well inside the paper . ###Other countries such as America allow papers to have a political leaning in terms of editorials etcetera .

177449:7	###, Lancashire Region , speaking on motion three four three . ###The anti-trade union laws which we face in October are just another attempt by this government to wipe out socialism and break the trade union movement . 
177462:7	###I believe what goes around comes around , and our day will come . ###No more oppression , no more shackles , no more exploitation . 
177466:39	###I move . ###Mister President , Congress , , Lancashire Region , seconding motion three four three . 
177468:172	###I believe , brothers and sisters , at this Conference , we must decide whether we 're gonna take away from here back to our members any credibility . ###If we do n't make a stand now then all of us in this hall will be a living , breathing testament to the betrayal of all those that have gone before us and we 'll leave nothing for anybody coming in the future . 
177471:42	###There comes a time when natural justice supersedes any law made by any government , and that time 's now . ###No longer the excuse of keeping low profile actions , hoping for a Labour government because if we have n't got the guts to stand up and fight the government that made these laws , then we 've got no right to challenge a future Labour government that inherits ' em . 
177474:7	###All our brothers and sisters , when they need us , whatever the cost , wherever the place , we need no one to do the job for us . ###We wo n't wait any longer . 
177491:7	###In another publication , circulated by the D T I to foreign embassies , the government boasts and I quote , new labour laws have been introduced so that employers are now under no statutory obligation to recognize any union . ###Colleagues , if this government is so blatantly prepared to sell out its own workers in such a public manner , then there will surely be no limit to the steps they will be prepared to take to further reduce union power . 
177496:81	###Unscrupulous employers have found new ways of sidestepping European social directives which depend on having union representatives in the workplace . ###By de-recognizing these representatives , employers can effectively ignore their obligations in Europe and thereby deny workers ' rights accepted as basic conditions in the eleven other member states . 
177500:76	###Is there a seconder for three four six ? ###Congress , I second motion three four six . 
177541:41	###Trade unionists are fighting back . ###The General Secretary mentions some of them in his Report , and I do not apologize for mentioning it again , they 're fighting back at Timex , they 're fighting back at Burnsall , in my own region at Crawley we 've twenty members who 've been on strike for the last sixteen and a half weeks . 
177600:25	###We need to ensure that these people get some form of equal right , equal right with a s simple contract . ###More and more employees are using these casual workers and every one of our jobs is under threat cos if you lose your job tomorrow , you 're a casual the day after . 
177619:7	###The forgotten people , or so it seems . ###The people who continue to be discriminated against by employers with regard to pay , holidays , redundancies , working conditions , pensions , maternity rights etcetera . 
177690:7	###In seconding the motion for keeping the May Day holiday , it is my opinion that th th g this government is having yet another go at the unions . ###It seems to me that we are having to fight all over again to keep many things that we have already fought for and gained in the past . 
177727:13	###Well , it 's better than no job at all som I hear them say . ###No , there can be no doubt that long-term effects will be bad for organized labour and a cruel price for many , a price not worth paying . 
177741:11	###If they try to impose it unilaterally , the employm employee would then be entitled to resign and claim constructive dismissal , or alternately , in some circumstances , take the action to a County Court . ###This is , of course , is where the problem starts . 
177745:34	###The tribunal or court could well take the view that the business needs to reorganize or terminate practices or indeed to cut costs . ###All of these can be viewed as valid reasons for changing a contract . 
177746:97	###All of these can be viewed as valid reasons for changing a contract . ###To succeed with a er constructive dismissal case the proposed changes must be viewed as fundamental . 
177767:34	###Many workers are already looking over their shoulders with four million people in reality unemployment in the United Kingdom . ###They do not see strike action as a real choice , and why should they ? 
177774:7	###The workers would rather stick to the status quo but know that an industrial tribunal would rule that the employer was forced to make the changes for supposedly sound economic reasons , and moreover had sought to agree financial compensation . ###The motion asks the C E C to initiate a campaign aimed at changing legislation , giving workers the right to refuse to accept changes to previous agreed contracts . 
177842:33	###We cannot afford to pussyfoot around with it , we cannot afford the time not to be on the move , on the move because that 's the only way our members are gonna dictate what they want . ###There will be a price to be paid , but it 's not to be undertaken at any price . 
177842:98	###We cannot afford to pussyfoot around with it , we cannot afford the time not to be on the move , on the move because that 's the only way our members are gonna dictate what they want . ###There will be a price to be paid , but it 's not to be undertaken at any price . 
177846:7	###But it 's something that we need to preserve strongly . ###The two organizations are s er so large that you ca n't join ' em together with two pieces of sticking plaster and three tin tacks . 
177864:31	###Many asked , is it the right time for the G M B to even consider merging with the T &G , particularly given the fact that over the past thirteen years the T &G has lost over fifty percent of their membership and now stands in great financial crisis . ###These issues are far- reaching and fundamental to our union . 
177869:29	###South Western Region ? ###, South Western Region , speaking in support of the Special Statement . 
177872:52	###In recent years , cooperation , not competition , has proved that the G M B and T G W U can work together for the advantage of all our members . ###We know that throughout the region there has been closer contact between our two unions , hosting joint conferences and campaigns with distinct advantages for all . 
177873:49	###We know that throughout the region there has been closer contact between our two unions , hosting joint conferences and campaigns with distinct advantages for all . ###Conference , with unemployment on the increase and trade union membership on the decline , trade unions must move forward with wider appeal , with a new concept of unionism for the future . 
177890:86	###I 'm gonna come back to the reservations , because if this amalgamation with the Transport and General Workers goes through , there 's gonna be the inevitable casualties . ###Yes , casualties within this organization , and nobody in this hall today can escape the possibility of the knife . 
177900:15	###We 're gonna have a surplus of organizers and , dare I say it , one of the General Secretaries is gonna be made redundant . ###Unless we take the cuts on board , it 's gonna be a waste of time discussing the possibilities of the amalgamations in the first place . 
177906:7	###Yes , look at a possible amalgamation , recognize the many difficulties which lie ahead , but remember also that the members and the activists within the G M B need to be kept fully informed of what the C E C are doing . ###I do n't want to listen to any more of the media speculation telling me what 's happening to our union . 
177917:58	###The document details recent experiences of closer contact with the T &G . ###It refers to exploring the scope for reducing , or eliminating , duplication of efforts and resources . 
177919:40	###This exploration of methods aimed at reducing expenditure , while at the same time improving our service , must be continued . ###And if these explorations conclusively point to an amalgamation with the T &G or any other union , then so be it . 
177920:7	###And if these explorations conclusively point to an amalgamation with the T &G or any other union , then so be it . ###But , before we consider any amalgamation with the T &G , we must ensure that our own house is in order . 
177921:7	###But , before we consider any amalgamation with the T &G , we must ensure that our own house is in order . ###We must ensure that we know in which direction we are going . 
177922:7	###We must ensure that we know in which direction we are going . ###We must decide how the G M B will cope with dramatic changes that will have , and will take place , in the workplaces that we represent . 
177928:56	###Fourteen years of Tory rule has seen to that . ###They have butchered our manufacturing base . 
177932:35	###They will need advice direct from the nearest G M B office . ###The advice that they need will in all probability be a different nature to the normal required in large workplaces . 
177933:89	###The advice that they need will in all probability be a different nature to the normal required in large workplaces . ###To make the G M B relevant advice is going to have to be available over the telephone . 
177952:80	###The saving in officer time , shop steward time , and the fact that we fight one another for the same people to join our organization , would be savings great indeed . ###The members who 've joined the G M B over the past , joined the G M B because in their opinion this was the best trade union in the U K and we are very very proud of our heritage . 
178003:7	###We 'll come to the personalities and the positions later on along the track , but first of all it 's got to be the members . ###And there will be changes . 
178004:13	###And there will be changes . ###There must be changes . 
178008:46	###I hope that on the basis of the assurances given , two five five can be withdrawn . ###I hope two two eight can be referred so that the content and discussion and the Report it asks for can be part of these discussions . 
178094:26	###Our education department has undergone a review which in return has produced quality materials and in turn quality stewards which meet the needs of all members . ###The health and safety department now known as the health and safety and environment department , is envied by other unions , and has clearly responded to its own review . 
178104:9	###There is a rule for a central research point but again colleagues , more is needed in the regions . ###Our union has been , without doubt , the shining light in terms of what we offer to members . 
178107:44	###The easiest way is to channel resources into the regions . ###A review by the C E C , in my opinion , would show that the agenda for the future will be local . 
178151:8	###It is recognized that G M B 's resources need to reflect this . ###This especially applies to research services because they supply the raw material with which we work , the information needed by the union to enable it to respond to the challenges which arise day by day . 
178185:28	###And the same also applies when our solicitors report that , having done th bes very best they can , they cannot recommend that the union continues to finance the claim . ###Try as we might , we cannot win every case . 
178223:7	###President , ladies and gentlemen . ###President , thank you for that welcome . 
178231:8	###Indeed , I 'm not er sure that there are n't still members of both our organizations who believe that right now each of us is supping with the devil . ###I do n't see it that way at all but if they 're right er I 'd defend your invitation and my acceptance by quoting the old idiom , better the devil you know . 
178249:47	###We 've been doing so because we believe that without an industrial strategy U K living standards and status will sink quite quickly to those of a Third World economy . ###We do n't want that and I 'm sure you do n't want it either . 
178277:7	###The potential for future economic growth depends partly on innovations in production technology , to reduce costs and , crucially , on innovative products which create new markets in themselves . ###Innovative products are an essential part of the process of economic growth , providing new employment and not just in manufacturing . 
178294:59	###They really do n't know much about industry . ###They do n't really care enough about industry , and they certainly do n't understand that our timescales are quite different from theirs . 
178302:13	###Now my second topic , how do employers view the trade unions today ? ###Surprisingly you may find , perhaps not so very differently from yourselves . 
178308:24	###You 've down-sized , restructured , looked at amalgamations and generally sought a new role , just like the E E F , just like industry . ###A bonanza in fact for management consultants and accountants . 
178316:10	###Now , er , now back to the main theme , which is that you 've become more business-like , in every sense of the word . ###You collaborate much more readily with industry . 
178338:38	###And we 're taking a lot more time talking to the Labour Party , and not only at their request again . ###The big issue is rebuilding and expanding our manufacturing base to ensure that we remain a prosperous industrialized country . 
178373:27	###We now find G M B offering nineteen seventy style benefits to a nineteen ninety style membership . ###The effect on us that every year our General Secretary during the finance debate , asks Congress to approve increases in contributions . 
178393:9	###In fact , expertise in a whole range of subjects too numerous to mention . ###President , in this motion I have tried to outline things that could be important and useful in recruiting drive . 
178394:11	###President , in this motion I have tried to outline things that could be important and useful in recruiting drive . ###But it must n't just be left to the activists to recruit . 
178394:53	###President , in this motion I have tried to outline things that could be important and useful in recruiting drive . ###But it must n't just be left to the activists to recruit . 
178414:7	###I guess not many that are sat in this room . ###So you can see the need for proper organization and the need for increased support from the union ? 
178415:42	###So you can see the need for proper organization and the need for increased support from the union ? ###We must get the trade organized and on the way to improved working conditions . 
178427:52	###President , Congress , , Midlands and East Coast Region , moving composite motion four . ###Colleagues , it is with a mixture of sadness , disappointment and disbelief that this motion is required to be brought before Congress today . 
178430:28	###There can be fewer more devastating experiences in life than to be thrust from a situation of regular employment with all the stature that this entails , to becoming an enforced member of society 's underclass , the unemployed the situation with a total lack of dignity , ask anyone who tries to claim benefits , the situation with a loss of social standing and frustration at unachievable ambitions . ###We hope that sooner or later the philosophy that classes people as mere units of labour will be consigned to the dustbin of history which it deserves . 
178454:22	###Once the labour movement offered hope and support to these people . ###They now have no ch no voice , there is only one way to counter this . 
178462:10	###There is another dimension to this motion that needs to be considered . ###If we continue to ignore these people , especially the young , we may be fighting them in the near fu future as they are actively being targeted by the far right British National Party and other fascist organizations that are using this sense of desertion .

178481:10	###With the facility of computers it is possible , as shown by other unions as well as forward-looking branches of our own , to communicate with members on a personal basis . ###This approach is never more important than when a person first joins any organization . 
178543:7	###The ship building industry has also been in decline for a decade or more , and in each year 's report has documented well that decline . ###A decline that 's under circumstances when we 're still an island nation , still dependent upon shipping to impor export and import most of our goods . 
178557:12	###But I think we were surprised of the speed of the receivership at Swans on Tyneside . ###So the fight is on to save ship building on Tyneside . 
178563:11	###We as a union , along with the S N C of the Confed do , and should , give unqualified and total support to this campaign . ###And as a first step we should demand three things essential to give any chance to retain ship building on Tyneside . 
178564:9	###And as a first step we should demand three things essential to give any chance to retain ship building on Tyneside . ###The three frigates must be allowed to be completed by Swan Hunter .

178607:8	###Right . ###, C E C Technical Craft Section , seconding the C E C Motion on Swan Hunter Ship Builders Limited . 
178672:147	###I wonder and I have grave doubts and reservations , that Charles the Third will have a Portsmouth and a naval base to fortify . ###I do not know , I have great reservations on that as long as the policies that have been perpetrated by this government remain . 
178694:94	###So please come away from that particular avenue . ###And the local authorities also we have government policy again we have the situation that Wage Councils which have agreed increases for our members within the prison service , do n't know whether they 'll be allowed to implement them because they are over the one and a half percent . 
178710:7	###Any political decision that could lead to the closure of either Devonport or Rossythe would also put the defence of this country at risk . ###We need a properly thought out defence policy we are a maritime nation we are in a maritime city we need a strong navy we need a strong defence . 
178712:7	###We must keep both the dockyards open together with the naval base in Portland , in Portsmouth . ###On T V this morning , as Neil has said , Gordon M P , was seeking a meeting with the Prime Minister . 
178718:62	###President , congress Neil , page one three four you say in your report and I quote , Sadly , T U P E does not cover pensions , although at this time there is some grey area . ###Neil T U P E regs do apply as the joint G M B T T T & G document clearly outlines . 
178791:51	###However when we look outwards and see what is happening in South Africa to trade unionists there , the scale of our problems is put into a truer perspective . ###Joining a trade union in South Africa and being active within that union can lead to dismissal physical violence imprisonment and even death .

178792:95	###Joining a trade union in South Africa and being active within that union can lead to dismissal physical violence imprisonment and even death . ###The black activists ' struggle for human rights within South Africa is one that this union must support we must look to support their unions in every way we can with both resources training and financial support . 
178793:17	###The black activists ' struggle for human rights within South Africa is one that this union must support we must look to support their unions in every way we can with both resources training and financial support . ###The changes that have been introduced into South Africa forced upon the white minority government by both international pressure but also by the magnificent work at the A N C in Cosatu must be supported as well but we cannot treat South Africa as anything but a pariah a , a , a national pariah until we see one person one vote , and a black majority government in South Africa . 
178813:79	###Friends , as we speak today about South Africa , we speak about transition transition from February nineteen ninety when De Klerk said that he would change things and he did change things and they were dramatic changes and then we had apartheid with a liberal dispensation . ###The A N C and other organizations were unbanned there was free activity people can meet others across the colour line if they so wish but basically the apartheid structures are in place still . 
178814:9	###The A N C and other organizations were unbanned there was free activity people can meet others across the colour line if they so wish but basically the apartheid structures are in place still . ###And let us remember that as De Klerk himself said they changed not because as he said , we wanted to but because we had to . 
178828:186	###The regime of course wants to keep the old order the A N C and freedom-loving people want a new order and a quick change but how do you mo move to that situation when you also have the right wing and the security forces and elsewhere not wanting change ? ###How do you , friends , change a structure which is still the old structure with a civil service , a security and everything that goes with it and move to one of democracy and justice because if you move too rapidly and you do not make concessions and you ignore the terrible power of the right wing with all the military might at its disposal you can very easily create in South Africa a Lebanon or indeed , yes , a Yugoslavia . 
178836:32	###Because and Ian Carter can only manage three percent . ###So democracy is a dangerous exercise when it means we empower the majority against minority groups that have rested on the support of the regime .

178837:10	###So democracy is a dangerous exercise when it means we empower the majority against minority groups that have rested on the support of the regime . ###Then after the elections or rather during the elections , we have to make sure that they are free and fair as you 've just heard and we from Britain and the Anti-Apartheid Movement has to be vigilant to ensure that we have international monitors from the U N , from the European Community , from the Commonwealth and individuals from , from Britain and elsewhere . 
178840:9	###So there 's no moment which is greater than this for supporting the liberation struggle . ###Meanwhile there 's growing violence as I 've said and we want to end the violence but we cannot wait to end the violence before we have the elections and you can imagine at what great disadvantage the democratic forces will work when they try to have elections in a violent atmosphere which is determined by the state structure .

178844:24	###No sanitation , water health , there 's no primary health care , virtually the only country in the world with no primary health care . ###Unemployment forty to fifty percent . 
178859:8	###And in this sense , when we liberate South Africa we will also create , we hope a state in the world which will become foremost in fighting racism all over the world and at the lower level our community based organizations our non-governmental organizations that have across colour built up structures to move communities forward if our friends in Eastern Europe and elsewhere could see how that is done at grass roots level in the hell of racism as I say they would have a lot to learn . ###So in the future we also have a lot to give to the rest of the world rather than just to look for help . 
178865:178	###We in the world campaign which has so far tried to stop armaments to South Africa and its nuclear build up we want to work if possible to build a common security er , arrangement in the region where peace will be everywhere if we can make it everywhere because the region has got so many weapons and arms and military expenditure is very easy to increase when you have growing number of nation states where the people really need food and development . ###So we hope that in this last mile that we 're now 
178873:45	###And then it is extremely difficult if you are not white not to become very angry with life it 's very difficult and then you hear that in Trafalgar Square someone demonstrated Canon or or Barbara and then you say no ! ###There are sensible white people in the world .

178892:109	###It 's worth noting , colleagues , that it 's only because of the determination of our members to ensure that their already meagre standard of living and basic rates are not further eroded that even this small achievement has been possible . ###I can also report to congress that at last there are some signs at long last of some kind of recovery in the building materials industry very early days yet but some companies are actually beginning to go back to full-time working and in one or two cases are actually starting to take on additional , er , employees . 
178905:95	###This is not only a shocking waste of their talents and skills and energy , but it 's a potent weapon that 's been put in the hands of the building employers and the consequence is , of course , that they 're seeking a twelve month pay and conditions freeze in the industry . ###The unions are presently consulting the membership as to how we should respond to this and that process is going on at the moment inside G M B the difficulty of course being the low level of organization . 
178928:20	###It 's now my very great pleasure , congress , to call Nigel to move the Health and Safety and Environment Service Review . ###Thank you Mr President , congress Nigel , Director of Health and Environment moving the special report , Health , Safety , Environment Service Review . 
178944:8	###At our conference in November we had a roll call of five hundred and six G M B members who 'd ha who were either killed in work or had died from work-related disease since May nineteen seventy nine those who attended may recall the emotional er ###feeling that this gave to the beginning of that conference and this government then has the audacity to talk about the burdens on employers what about the burdens on the families of those whose relatives have been killed or diseased through workplace injuries by the negligence of the employers that actually employ them ?

178947:141	###The G M B has rejected this approach and recognized that we have to improve health and safety standards at the workplace . ###In the special report , specific re recommendations are made to improve the consistency of safety representatives ' training improving information flow and giving more uniform support to full-time officers support in the workplace . 
178954:63	###Thank you very much , Nigel . ###Fred , C E C member , seconding the special report on Health , Safety and the Environment . 
178955:32	###Fred , C E C member , seconding the special report on Health , Safety and the Environment . ###President in seconding the report I would like to make the following points to our safety representatives who have to bear the responsibility for improving conditions at the workplace for our members . 
178959:26	###It is clearly recognized in the report that the safety representative 's role is vital if workplace standards are to be consistently improved . ###Since the first of January this year safety representatives have been given legal rights to be con consulted and I quote in good time regarding the following one any measure which substantially affects the health and safety of employees two the arrangements for appointing specialist staff three any health and safety information circulated to employees four the planning and organization of any health and safety training and five , the introduction of new technologies . 
178992:16	###It is particularly refreshing to note the amount of self-criticism that appears throughout the report . ###It is equally refreshing to note that such criticism is acknowledged and solutions are readily available to provide an answer .

179014:76	###Yorkshire region . ###John , Yorkshire and North Derbyshire , speaking in support of the Health and Safety , Environment Service Review . 
179025:19	###The changes in legislation have been dramatic since the mid-eighties the majority of changes coming in at the beginning of nineteen ninety three with the E C directives . ###We now have a legal requirement on employers which are clearly written and which we can use to our advantage providing our safety reps have been correctly trained to implement the regulations .

179027:55	###The environment we live in must also be protected sources of pollution must be located and stopped employers clearly held liable for their actions and dealt with as severely as allowed by law . ###Our union is still leading the field in provision of the information and training to enable our safety representatives to deal with the ramifications of the new regulations . 
179037:45	###The Southern region supports the initiative but urges caution . ###We have been told that finances for health and safety will be found but we were never told from where that money would come from . 
179037:86	###The Southern region supports the initiative but urges caution . ###We have been told that finances for health and safety will be found but we were never told from where that money would come from . 
179039:50	###Colleagues , to promote a culture of health and safety , our starting point must be to establish a network of safety reps in the workplaces and we must have proper funds for training for all of our safety reps that is a most crucial part of the report . ###The introduction in January ninety three of six European directives has given us a unique opportunity to raise the profile of the G M B both in places where we have membership and elsewhere , when the message gets across how the G M B reps are so well trained and able to represent members on all health and safety issues .

179057:9	###London region . ###President , congress Ray , London region speaking in support of the motion , er sorry , the report close . 
179064:42	###If you look at the general secretary report under the regional sections there is an invisible service you 'll be unable to find the health and safety side . ###The special report is meant to make sure that the Health and Safety s=Service are not the Cinderella service there should be a general principle of accountability and monitoring of the service in the regions . 
179083:71	###I believe that our new computer system when it 's linked to all the regions , will have the potential to access detailed health and safety information and I hope we will use it er , and make the information technology that is available to further our health and s safety service delivery . ###In doing so we will create the opportunity to deliver an individual service to our members through instant response and while improving our service to the members we will also improve our recruitment potential . 
179084:7	###In doing so we will create the opportunity to deliver an individual service to our members through instant response and while improving our service to the members we will also improve our recruitment potential . ###The , the report addresses the past and current G M B policy but it is the future needs of our members that we must plan for .

179085:25	###The , the report addresses the past and current G M B policy but it is the future needs of our members that we must plan for . ###We must consolidate our expertise and where that expertise is not evident , we must create it . 
179194:143	###I like this one too . ###I know erm it 's got loads of punch . 
179318:120	###Er , er it I think the whole place is sort of over the other side there 's a , sort of a bridge there and possibly , I mean , I 'm sure that I 've seen a photograph from the other side . ###Erm with this sort of landscape I always credit the type of lens which is being used , and I think a wide angle lens has been used here , because we could see there 's been a lot of interest created in the foreground , and this is what a a wide angle lens will do for you in , in , in a landscape . 
179362:145	###You see , especially here , that sort of erm white metal bit , the er brushed chrome sort of finish on that tends to get a little bit lost in this white background . ###It does n't here , that 's fine , it 's great here , but , at the bottom because it , it 's not being lit quite so well as the top you 're tending to lose a little bit of quality , especially there . 
179483:10	###Er , do n't always take the first one and that you take loads of picture around , if you see an interesting subject , make sure you move around and take loads of pictures , and then select the one for printing . ###And I think this is a very good erm er illustration of that fact . 
179769:17	###you know , we would li I do n't mind people being in it , but I 'd rather , you know , can you imagine that er the Greek priest we had in the very first print ###I mean he would fit into this er in a , in , in a superb way . 
179795:125	###Yeah it 's ###Ha . 
179796:89	###Ha . ###erm the thing about this title portrait which I always er like to emphasize and is that when you 're using props like these stools or any other props at all in this sort of glamour photography then they must be in absolutely pristine condition , and they are here . 
179875:22	###I did n't realize that they could be got ready in such a short space of time . ###But anyway , very dramatic shot looking up into the mouth of the balloon with this huge flame going up . 
179877:32	###I guess th that you must have be actually been in the basket . ###We do n't get the impression erm of whether you were airborne at that stage . 
179878:20	###We do n't get the impression erm of whether you were airborne at that stage . ###I would think if you were n't , you must have been very nearly . 
179962:7	###I 'll give that one an eight as well . ###Heather . 
179981:32	###Oh ! ###And despite , you know , managed , he somehow he 'd get them through and get . 
180052:31	###Is she ? ###Oh why ? 
180068:7	###It was erm , I should n't think , I should n't say this on the air , it was f on a cellar steps , at a teenage party . ###Disgraceful , that ! 
180123:20	###Saddam certainly has done his best to milk the whole occasion . ###I think it was er fairly evident that he had given permission for the three British hostages to be released after Sir Edward Heath 's meeting with Tariq . 
180125:144	###But er no , Sir Edward had to go through the full rigmarole of a meeting with the great man , I put that in inverted commas , but er I suppose he thinks he is , the great man himself , Saddam Hussein . ###So , I wonder if you feel there is a deal . 
180142:171	###. Health and safety watchdogs say they 're not convinced the Channel Tunnel has sufficient safety measures in place to protect passengers , and after that incident a few weeks ago , which was er certainly played down by the authorities , I wonder just how safe the Tunnel is . ###Well , it does n't open till May , but the Health and Safety Executive say that safety procedures still have n't been tested , and even if they had , would you go through the Tunnel ? 
180189:19	###I would just going to talk about the television licences . ###Please do 
180191:9	###Erm , well if we have to pay twenty pounds extra for erm , an extra television , what about the shops that sell them ? ###Mhm . 
180203:20	###Mhm . ###But other people erm , I , I think it 's a lot of money . 
180272:11	###Or did you feel , well , he 's done an admirable job . ###Do you feel that anybody could have done that job ? 
180302:48	###Everyone , I think , is vulnerable to the guest , or guests that descend upon you from time to time . ###Generally relatives from Scotland in my case , and decide to stay , having invited themselves , and you ca n't really turn them away , er , decide to stay for two or three days . 
180311:21	###That 's what we 'll be attempting to find out in twenty minutes ' time . ###And Spurs fans especially , but football fans in general , I 'd like to hear your tribute please , to Danny Blanchflower who died so tragically at the age of sixty seven yesterday , from Alzheimer 's Disease . 
180314:7	###One of the greatest players ever to put on a Spurs ' jersey I would think . ###A man who led Spurs to the League and Cup double , some thirty or so years ago . 
180327:64	###And we 're looking for two couples , er it need n't be husband and wife particularly , although it 'll be er very nice if it is , but it can be mother and daughter , father and son , any combination you like really . ###Two couples to come to Australia with us , and to act as roving reporters , travelling round the country , reporting on what they see to me , on the telephone , live on the programme , all expenses paid , thought I 'd just er let you know that er very important fact .

180460:14	###it 's a little bit disconcerting when they forget you 're there , and erm ###Especially if you 've got thin walls . 
180484:7	###Er , we originally , my wife and I , come from Scotland , and when you get people ringing up from er Scotland saying , well we 're just passing through en route to Paris , or Amsterdam , or somewhere , can we stay with you for a couple of days , it 's very difficult not to say , er , well , I 'm busy is n't it really , and you , you 've got to accept them really ? ###Yes . 
180486:8	###You have to , because , how can you be busy for that entire period of time ? ###It 's too hard to think on , you know , on the hop , you know , it 's not a , it 's impossible . 
180486:20	###You have to , because , how can you be busy for that entire period of time ? ###It 's too hard to think on , you know , on the hop , you know , it 's not a , it 's impossible . 
180493:19	###It 's very amusing , and you 've explained it amusingly to us , but er , there 's a lot of truth , I think in er , what you say and er how can we , er make the best of these unwelcome guests who insist on turning up at the most inopportune times , when we 're trying to enjoy ourselves . ###Anyway , I 'm sure you 'll have horror stories , of guests who 've invited themselves . 
180502:110	###And , er after the break , it 'll be Anne from Hither Green , getting us off on our section of phone calls . ###Most people , I think know by now , certainly regular listeners will know , that at the end of next month , the end of January , this programme , Douglas Cameron 's Breakfast Call , will be coming to you live , from Sydney , Australia , to mark Australia Day . 
180523:53	###I loved her , even though she was miserable , because she was kind , ###Yes .

180772:54	###Well , er , Anna , and it is er , er a complaint that is er , often , er put up on this programme when we discuss television , they 're repeated , and I do agree . ###There are an awful lot of repeats , especially through the summer , on the B B C especially . 
180783:51	###Yes . ###so , we decided to pretend we were n't in . 
180832:53	###That is the proposal from MPs on the Commons ' Heritage Committee , do you think it 's fair ? ###That if you have a second telly in the house , you should pay twenty pounds extra in licence money for it .

181082:31	###Er , well , that 's the point what a marvellous draw Barnet 's got Mr Cameron , against Chelsea in the Cup ? ###Oh yes , that 's right , of course , you 're a great Barnet supporter just an ex 
181087:7	###Derek thank you very much indeed for your call . ###Thank you Mr. Cameron , bye-bye 
181126:8	###I think that 's er , perhaps , er , enough to be said about Dennis Law 's game . ###A brilliant player , played many great games , but erm , very competitive . 
181231:12	###Lord has asked me to say a few words about erm er , directors ' salaries and particularly about his own . ###Now I do n't stand here in any sense of defending these salaries , in fact I think our policy is entirely right and it is not inflationary . 
181247:10	###So it would be rather interesting if we could have some sort of comparison . ###Would one of our American directors like to 
181252:16	###So I think that th the scheme that erm Pearson uses is er , not at all dissimilar to what would be a fairly standard practice in the United States . ###and people like that , but er , I believe that the , the way it 's actually organized is different .

181582:36	###That was Sarah who did the Works Skills for Women Course at Fast Forward and that 's now helped her to get on to some G C S E courses at college . ###Can anyone go along to Fast Forward then is it open to all comers . 
181596:17	###Now Fast Forward was for everyone was n't it , this one is n't ? ###No it is n't . 
181596:36	###Now Fast Forward was for everyone was n't it , this one is n't ? ###No it is n't . 
181598:82	###First of all you have to be unemployed and you have to be black or Asian . ###Now it 's especially for people who are black or Asian because a lot of the time they miss out on the opportunities that are available to a lot of other people because of things like language barriers and although you might think it 's unfair it 's not actually illegal .

181639:49	###Well we 'll see what we say anyway we 've got er we 've got a couple of the Councillors on erm after one o' clock today Councillor Stuart Argyle and we 've got David Poole on as well ###Oh right 
181690:15	###No no . ###Are you going to keep feeding it up until Christmas ? 
181822:12	###If Robson does n't play then Roy Keen will take his place . ###And an announcement will be made later today about the venue for the World Cup qualifier between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland which is scheduled for Belfast on November the seventeenth . 
181930:24	###All right then well I 'll get the I 'll get the two councillors on in a minute . ###Okay . 
182248:24	###I 'll talk to you tomorrow okay ? ###Erm I 'm not in tomorrow I 'm in on Friday . 
182308:74	###But then there are street accidents which usually mean people discharging fireworks in the street which in itself is an offence enforced by the police . ###And that is very very hot and will give some nasty burns to people 's hands . 
182593:49	###The third is producing coal cheaply but most of it is being stockpiled because no one wants to buy it . ###A spokesman for the National Union of Mineworkers says it 's what was expected . 
182639:7	###On the hour the news and weather and we 'd like to hear from you this afternoon . ###If you 'd like to have a chat on the air call us on . 
182885:26	###Cos you know it takes t at least eighteen strong men or twenty four weak women ? ###You know that ? 
182973:28	###erm it 's just ###It sounds like everybody 's gonna be exhausted at your place . 
182973:49	###erm it 's just ###It sounds like everybody 's gonna be exhausted at your place . 
183025:157	###Do you know if she got married ? ###N no I don er it 's quite a long st we it 's quite a long story . 
183067:10	###Well I presume she did . ###How long is it since you saw her ? 
183630:33	###David was speaking to an Australian radio station shortly before lawyers acting for the Princess issued writs against and the gym owner . ###I think it was a particularly sneaky trick frankly . 
183676:54	###Yeah . ###Okay . 
183876:37	###Yeah . ###Never put a foot wrong ? 
183876:66	###Yeah . ###Never put a foot wrong ? 
183882:37	###Then the policeman come on and said , is that your dog ? ###You know er or is it a stray ? 
183911:24	###of an old English sheepdog . ###Yes . 
183913:9	###I hate to see that I must say . ###Yeah . 
184016:47	###Chris thinks roof bolts should only be allowed where the section 's are supported by thick coal pillars . ###The idea of a roadway supported on either side by a coal pillar and supported in the er in the beam of the roof er by er roof bolts making that beam stronger , so that the sides will support the beam , is a good one . 
184017:8	###The idea of a roadway supported on either side by a coal pillar and supported in the er in the beam of the roof er by er roof bolts making that beam stronger , so that the sides will support the beam , is a good one . ###And in the right circumstances er it need not be be criticized , but the circumstances have to be right for it .

184030:82	###But not in this case at Bilsthorpe . ###Does that not return then to our point that exemptions are being granted more freely ? 
184072:7	###It was discovered they too had been sabotaged . ###This time by the insertion of a thick filter inside the machine itself . 
184087:45	###To my knowledge I know that it 's happening in at least half a dozen mines . ###It 's being done up and down the country as well as round our vicinity of mining . 
184129:74	###In evidence to a common select committee the consultants stressed the importance of newer , cost efficient , methods . ###Exemptions from safety laws to use them was encouraged . 
184142:78	###Deep or extended cut accounts for half of all deaths and roof collapses in American mines . ###For the company it means grater profits , but to these men it means more dangerous conditions . 
184225:85	###You can have profitable mines if you want more fatalities , more accidents and more bad news like Bilsthorpe . ###Now if you want a coal industry you can have a good coal industry , a profitable one . 
184230:7	###The accident level in this industry has come down consistently , year , by year , by year , every year . ###Last year were the lowest on record . 
184262:72	###I mean we 're a typical case , we believe we have something that is wonderfully innovative and capable of succeeding financially in a global market place . ###It was very difficult to get the venture capitalists and the bankers to take it seriously . 
184308:9	###We all know that job creation comes form the small and medium company sector . ###It is perhaps not totally coincidental that there are three million unemployed and three million companies and er You could do the arithmetic about what would happen if every company took on one person . 
184382:66	###We are quite keen to look at equity options , debt equity swaps er perhaps talk a to the government about an extension of the business expansion scheme , specifically into manufacturing industry er and generally look for innovative solutions , persuade to customers to take loans out instead of overdrafts . ###Er fix their interest rates over a longer term period . 
184390:84	###As both company chairman and business angel , Sir John plays an active role . ###He and Ivan are equal partners . 
184400:61	###A business relies on a driving personality taking it forward , and the confusion about getting somebody on board who is working with you in the business and who is putting money board , is that they feel to some extent , proprietorial to that business , and you can find that that will result in those individuals who have done that tearing apart the business because they are trying to go in different directions . ###At the moment there are a number of publications such as Link , Capital Exchange , venture Capital Report , which try to put investors and companies in touch with each other . 
184405:48	###B C R executive , Hamish , is sceptical about the banks ' sudden endorsement of angels . ###In terms of their they the core business , they are reliant on on on medium size businesses , so they need to ensure that in the future that there will be businesses there er t er to be their clients , so I think er it 's a sort of enlightened self interest . 
184421:24	###Mike now travels the country as a consultant to small companies . ###The lessons he 's learnt he did so the hard way . 
184430:29	###One idea that were quite attracted to er would be the formation of a business TESSA . ###This could operate rather like a personal TESSA and would be a er tax free savings account , which would allow a small business to save for a perhaps a major piece of machinery in a tax free environment . 
184445:31	###This company of ex Roll Royce workers has had five offers of finance and is in the enviable position of choosing the partner that suits them . ###On the back of their expected thirty thousand pound cash injection they 've already taken on extra staff . 
184446:15	###On the back of their expected thirty thousand pound cash injection they 've already taken on extra staff . ###For this successful local experiment to have national implications there has to be a fundamental shift in attitudes . 
184451:12	###The business angels ca n't do it all themselves . ###They need the support of the government . 
184458:59	###The attack is being spear headed from his new London offices by lawyer Paul . ###There will be firms who are practising today who will probably figure in the er top one hundred in the city who in my opinion will not be practising in that shape or form three years from now . 
184458:119	###The attack is being spear headed from his new London offices by lawyer Paul . ###There will be firms who are practising today who will probably figure in the er top one hundred in the city who in my opinion will not be practising in that shape or form three years from now . 
184551:51	###This week hopes to emerge with a large Birmingham law firm to strengthen its hand further . ###The game plan is to grow big enough to threaten even the city giants . 
184584:53	###And a British F C C would fit much more naturally into the Department of Trade 's portfolio , than into that of the department of national heritage , which currently looks after broadcasting . ###Perhaps Mr Heseltine 's sudden interest in television is motivated by more than a simple desire to boost British exports . 
184637:36	###But it 's incredible to think that such things happened in them days is n't it really ? ###It was awful . 
184673:11	###How did you help to support your mam through ? ###Well erm I remember when my father would never give my mother any money . 
184675:9	###We always had to chase after him for it and he 'd never give her more than a pound a week . ###Never . 
184685:7	###Well she did you know I do n't know how she did you know . ###She was a miracle . 
184718:22	###Always baked baked her own bread and we used go , we used to run that to the to the bakers to have it for baking sort of thing . ###And that was about every other day she used to bake about ooh I forget whether it was fourteen pound or twenty eight pound of flour she us . 
184736:13	###So she 'd go to the chemist not to the doctor then ? ###Oh n we 'd go to the doctor . 
184764:112	###Only she could n't touch us if we were hurt . ###Really ? 
184828:26	###Yeah . ###Cos people here have done everything in that one room did n't they ? 
184828:61	###Yeah . ###Cos people here have done everything in that one room did n't they ? 
184833:83	###We there was n't room for a three piece suite sort of thing and then you 'd have a sideboard and a table , chairs to sit on like hard chairs , wooden chairs like kitchen chairs . ###But you would n't have er you would n't have easy chairs or nothing like that . 
184866:108	###And erm I think he died if I remember rightly , he died on the erm twenty fifth of January and my other brother was born on the third of ###Thank you . 
184874:22	###Over fourteen pounds born , he was the heaviest child that they 'd ever delivered . ###Your poor mother . 
184875:37	###Your poor mother . ###Yes so that 's why she had to have a doctor for that one . 
184878:26	###Cos she had n't washed her feet for going back to bed . ###The soles of her feet and the then they knew she 'd been up on her feet you know . 
184904:53	###And my mam went there and she cut her down and everything you know . ###From a beam where she 'd er she 'd hung herself . 
184905:8	###From a beam where she 'd er she 'd hung herself . ###And when she came home she said , Do you know what she said she must have taken ages she said to put that cord through that er beam , she said . 
184919:77	###I think she saved more money that week on food . ###We just did n't fancy anything she 'd touched you know . 
184930:57	###I think there 's more more recently that 's done things like that than there was in them days . ###Mm . 
185019:45	###And she 'd be watching you like a hawk you know . ###But er it comes natural to a baby a swim does n't it ? 
185075:44	###And it was girls in school then that s s you know when you started talking about , Ooh what happened to me on the beach and that . ###Oh did n't you know , I could 've told you that you know then we got to know all the all the things when it was too late but as regards my mother telling us anything brrr no . 
185091:25	###Oh I 'll never forge oh she was the most miserable child that God every created she was honestly . ###And oh God and every time I got , take this one with you more misery . 
185099:34	###Though you thought , Oh come on old misery ca n't I go out on my own some time ? ###The only place I was allowed to go to school I think . 
185130:31	###No . ###No we never had visitors , my mother could n't she could n't afford to have visitors you know . 
185156:69	###And he accepted the situation ? ###Well there wa hardly anything else he could do it was a big relief to us was n't it . 
185163:61	###For no reason whatever . ###And he was n't the sort of man what my mother could say , Now look this one 's been naughty today will you chastise them ? 
185185:113	###Did you ? ###Yes . 
185283:7	###And believe me in a couple of weeks after we got the slate for him . ###We had a new fork lift , we had tools galore , everything was coming in . 
185288:22	###Every money was coming in everywhere . ###From a poor man he did n't half step up . 
185352:48	###Oh yeah , well they were n't good slaters as the , you know , but they did produce slate there , but they did n't they were n't good slaters the just that , well they make slate but . ###If they would n't have made a scrap of slate it would have a world of difference to this strike . 
185423:81	###Everybody went home an , we were all on picket line after . ###Have you got any idea of w what they thought then of the fact that you were all acting , the three quarries , were acting as erm one body ? 
185495:7	###Was that considered a hard thing at the time ? ###Very hard , very hard I told the lads I told ' em the union about it what he done that day . 
185519:83	###As they they got fed up with it I suppose I dunno er . ###But there was no point in carrying it on really you know it . 
185519:122	###As they they got fed up with it I suppose I dunno er . ###But there was no point in carrying it on really you know it . 
185525:100	###Well we c could n't we had a lot of arguments about it you know in the union meetings about this picket line . ###But we could n't make anybody do it , you know they 'd say , anyway that we 'll do it , there 's there 's next week they would n't catch you up some of them . 
185553:51	###Oh aye , know these youngsters today , they not er not the same as when we were young I do n't think . ###They do n't seem to worry about anything a lot of these youngsters today . 
185554:35	###They do n't seem to worry about anything a lot of these youngsters today . ###You know if you 're out on strike you 're out on strike and must make it hundred percent , that 's how it is . 
185610:32	###Yet another Midlands Derby and I think this season ###Well 
185630:10	###Well the new Filbert Street taking shape the five million pound main stand official open since our last visit here and when the lower tier is completed by the end of the year the stand will house about ten thousand people all seated and under cover . ###One facility has already had plenty of use and that 's the physio 's room . 
185631:48	###One facility has already had plenty of use and that 's the physio 's room . ###Leicester have had to cope with a lot of injuries in the early part of the season the most serious blow the loss of Steve Walsh . 
185670:78	###But I personally felt that that was a good tackle on Speedy , Ron how did you see it ? ###Yeah I think Colin Cooper stepped in to play very very very quickly and that 's something I think Frank Clarke w will be looking for from him . 
185702:12	###I mean their stock play normally is er a quality ball from Thomson into big Walsh well you know with Walsh missing they they 've gotta sort of be a little bit more inventive with their free kicks . ###Speedy can of course you know he 's a good little leaper for a small lad but they 're not just gonna be able to whack the ball up there . 
185800:8	###Good football this by Leicester Jochim across by Greyson Ormanroyd coming in on the back post . ###Pearce gets it away to Oldfield well he 's scored some really spectacular goals in his career David Oldfield and he was n't far off with that shot . 
185803:20	###Good early ball in partial clearance I thought Ormanroyd might have got on that . ###Partial clearance here from Stewart Pearce . 
185832:26	###Jochim turns it through to Speedy who could n't repeat the dose . ###Here 's Thomson and now Lewis turned back again by Ormanroyd and Leicester playing some good football in Forest 's half . 
185850:7	###Collimore doing well there he really turned Greyson and he 's got Black storming down the left and Rozario to the right . ###Good running by Oldfield to get back . 
185913:38	###But at the moment they 're on fire Leicester are on fire at the moment . ###As I say this this fellow the last twenty minutes are the best I 've seen Leicester City play for a long long time . 
185964:35	###Well I ca n't see what else he 's given this decision for now . ###Well that was a mystery a little bit initially . 
185980:10	###I mean Simon Greyson is not not picking up here neither is Colin Hill and really it 's come on a little bit sudden but that was totally unnecessary as well . ###That well we 've seen some comic cuts things going in the last five minutes or so have n't we . 
185981:40	###That well we 've seen some comic cuts things going in the last five minutes or so have n't we . ###But I must admit I 've got to know what happened with that goal , or free kick in 
186063:73	###Though I 'll say as I said earlier in the half there 's some play some referees might have seen that as a sending off offence . ###What d' you think Ron ? 
186112:13	###Quick thinking by Forest . ###Penalized there bit unfortunate but justice was done . 
186151:15	###And finally Cooper 's shoulder 's obviously very bad you 've had it taken ###Yeah er doctor thinks it 's best if he comes off . 
186194:125	###Taken by Phillips looks for Pearce left Oldfield wins it back for Leicester though . ###Well you would n't have fancied that as a goalkeeper would you Pearce suddenly came flying in on Ward . 
186206:50	###Well it 's if there 's anything wrong with Rozario they are in trouble Forest . ###They 've already lost the centre half the last thing they want to happen is to lose a centre forward . 
186209:132	###Rozario limps on but he does n't look too comfortable . ###Free kick taken by Phillips and wasted by him . 
186217:80	###Just put Webby on the right-hand side of midfield and put little Gary Crosby up the middle where he 's played a few times for Forest . ###Or more than a few times actually . 
186220:18	###Hope they do n't think we 're an unlucky omen for them . ###And that 's a foul by Greyson on Stone free kick to Nottingham Forest and Rozario has gone not gone down but he 's holding his leg again inside the penalty area and er he 's not a happy . 
186235:41	###So you can imagine Frank Clarke thinking well we 've got the wind behind us we 've gotta put a lot of high balls into the box and he is very important to us but at the moment he 's not making the box . ###I mean the big fellows here they 've got to try and run it off or give it a tug and come off come off and get the er the sub on . 
186269:19	###Pearce a little square ball Webby plays the one two and Pearce does n't stop his running keeps his run going . ###That was Forest in their pomp . 
186278:38	###Two one at Luton . ###There 's only about er what is it four teams below them in the table at the moment and a defeat today would be a serious blow for them . 
186289:31	###Gemmell just kept in by Crosby and it comes again to Gemmell . ###It 's a poor ball though by Scott Gemmell giving possession by to Greyson and now Jochim . 
186303:41	###Offside Collimore . ###And incidentally going back to that shot by Jochim in the end the referee gave a free kick against him for er presumably fouling the defender which seemed a harsh decision . 
186399:28	###Webb takes over three against three at the moment though Leicester getting men back quickly . ###Collimore he 's turned and found some room for himself . 
186463:8	###Collimore 's done well , Webb . ###That might have been the moment Forest drew level . 
186464:27	###That might have been the moment Forest drew level . ###I must confess the moment er Stan Collimore set it up for Webb , I mean it 's a nice ball he does brilliant here Colin , checks the and shapes a nice little ball into Webby 's path and the one thing Webby 's still got he 's he 's got good feet . 
186475:13	###man of the match David Oldfield Al I think he 's had a good game Agnew 's played well , Lewis . ###Been one or two good players today but er over ninety minutes this man very impressive . 
186485:20	###Mills in possession for Leicester . ###Hill and Whitlow taking a few chances in their own half and finally Whitlow 's dispossessed and it comes to Collimore . 
186515:122	###Oldfield did well to ride that challenge from Pearce . ###And that 's the final whistle it 's all over and Leicester City have gained a very very hard won victory here over Nottingham Forest by one goal to nil . 
186532:7	###Let 's hear from Frank Clarke now with Gary Newbon . ###Frank it 's just not going for you . 
186559:61	###And a player who was desperately unlucky on the day not to get the equalizer because he 's taken two players on he knows what he 's doing there he deliberately did that and was very unfortunately . ###Er but you get the feeling that if he does n't score then as I said nobody else can . 
186575:31	###Tommy Johnson needed the hand of God to evade Nigel Martin in goal . ###He looked sheepish as Herts scored Martin was anything but as the goal stood . 
186581:80	###He did well to hook in his tenth of the season . ###As we 've often said Derby can look shaky with the two goal lead . 
186637:27	###The commentators John Helm and Theo Foley . ###instinctively out to Barber , three men up around the edge of the area . 
186669:19	###Not not of our ilk . ###Never mind never mind . 
186685:21	###I 've made some well some very big sacrifices especially early on in my career when nobody would have known that I was probably even in the country . ###And this is nice to know that there is sometimes if you put your head down and work hard at something there is something at the end of the rainbow . 
186741:10	###So we 'll see . ###Well maybe he 's er got a contract to appear on the media . 
186762:33	###Quick call that 's all it will take and then er we ring you back and bear the burden of the telephone bill . ###Erm life imprisonment should no longer be the automatic penalty for murder , that 's according to the committee chaired by the former er Lord er er former Lord Chief Justice Lord Lane . 
186780:156	###It 's ten minutes past nine and joining us on the line this morning is er Judy in York good morning Judy . ###Good morning Jonathan . 
186787:15	###They 'd start er you know one man gen mentioned er that when we get married in church erm we are making sacred vows you know we start with God but then we get busy with our living and our jobs and having our families and then somehow we forget about God and we we try to go on without him . ###But er I I do belie I 've we we go to a a church in in York and er I believe in the saying , The family that prays together stays together , and a christian foundation for marriage i gives stability in your relationship . 
186867:109	###No the position is that er given that this is a fourth stage er planning process . ###You 've got the District Council the County Council then the national Government may intervene by calling in the application . 
186875:69	###Took me by awares er by er by surprise . ###Let me go to er where I expected to go now to John the County Planning Officer . 
186884:32	###Mr refers to European law and environmental statements that was passed into British legislation we have fully complied with that . ###An environmental statement was required from the company it has been given full publicity I believe that the Planning Committee and County Planning Committee today have sufficient information to come to a decision an informed decision . 
186901:131	###Well you say that but I mean there are plenty of other coal disposal facilities in the country . ###What eventually is proposed would be very similar to Hambleton and Bath in terms of its impact in the local environment . 
186902:47	###What eventually is proposed would be very similar to Hambleton and Bath in terms of its impact in the local environment . ###There are few people , I 'm very concerned for those people and we will be imposing conditions if members wish to approve it to protect the interests of the few people in close proximity , many of the objectors er they must be heard and their point of view is report in the committee papers but they do live at er a couple of miles from the site . 
186903:74	###There are few people , I 'm very concerned for those people and we will be imposing conditions if members wish to approve it to protect the interests of the few people in close proximity , many of the objectors er they must be heard and their point of view is report in the committee papers but they do live at er a couple of miles from the site . ###Er I would say that the impact of the development if it goes ahead must be limited at that distance . 
186919:91	###Does it raise issues of more than local importance . ###The view of the County Council is that it does not raise those issues . 
186941:11	###It is going to be nine and a half times the footprint of Hambleton three and a half times the footprint of Brayton Bath it will tower in its mass beside them and it is totally unreasonable and wrong for anybody to describe it as merely of local concern . ###John . 
186985:49	###They say that there are going to be dust clouds issuing from this site comparable to the dust clouds that used to issue from the P F A lagoons at Brotherton . ###And that 's almost a straight quotation from that report . 
187036:242	###What the three thousand four hundred are saying is that the County Council and British Coal do not know where they 're going with this thing , the full implications of it have either not been properly assessed or indeed not been released to the to the local communities . ###They feel that as it 's their heritage they should have a say in the matter and a proper consideration and therefore there are thousands of signatures saying please can we have a public inquiry . 
187091:95	###Well Stewart 's on the Parish Council are n't you Stewart ? ###Yes I am . 
187093:26	###Er yes well that is so this did come through er very very late indeed er in the and the Parish Council of course are in the situation where they have to cover all eventualities and what er Mr is referring to is a suggestion of using a one O six agreement to protect as far as possible the local communities when the tip is erected . ###It did n't change the the actual view of the people in the village . 
187101:51	###And that is where the Parish Council were coming from . ###If I can just endorse what Stewart was saying the Parish Council talked to me as their consultant for a while and said look it seems that that with the with the actions of the er County Council writing to the Secretary of State to preempt the call-in procedures and the attitude of the District Council that this thing might well get local planning permission . 
187111:26	###Peter one final question probably to you . ###Where can you take your campaign if today 's meeting at County Hall in about forty minutes which I know you 've got to dash off and and get ready for , erm where can you take your campaign , the joint villages action committee 's campaign , if erm the meeting today gives the tip at Gascoigne Woods approval ? 
187113:29	###Well we 've heard what Edward has had to say and the local communities I 'm certain draw great comfort from that and we wait and see whether Brussels will exercise its powers , quite legitimately in my view , and and call this in . ###Er in the alternative of course er the local communities have available er the High Court action which I 've referred to during several discussions with yourselves over the last week or two . 
187119:7	###Why ? ###Er but I refute that the County Council is unsympathetic to local concerns . 
187154:203	###Formal just how it should be on the B B C thank you very much indeed to everybody erm joining in that debate . ###And I 'm not sure that personally I 'm put my hands up and say that I 'd understand all the issues but I understand some of the basic principles and I 'm beginning to understand er some of the complexities of a a planning issue like this . 
187159:15	###We 'll find out in a moment or twos time . ###There 's a moment before the traffic and travel news now for me to remind you that erm if you 're the chairman or the secretary or whatever it happens to be of a particular group whether it be erm the local amateur dramatics society or er a North Yorkshire charity and you 'd like the opportunity to have some prime time publicity for what you 're doing , particularly in the run-up to the Christmas period 
187203:7	###We are going through a crucial period . ###What this Tory government intends to do is see total destruction of the trade union movements . 
187203:66	###We are going through a crucial period . ###What this Tory government intends to do is see total destruction of the trade union movements . 
187204:9	###What this Tory government intends to do is see total destruction of the trade union movements . ###We have to make sure in this trade union and labour movement that because there will be struggles ahead , this has to be one that is foremost in our minds . 
187205:71	###We have to make sure in this trade union and labour movement that because there will be struggles ahead , this has to be one that is foremost in our minds . ###This conference has to give a message to Jo John Smith to maintain union links , to strengthen them , not destroy them . 
187211:58	###I came to Congress with my contribution to this debate firmly fixed in my own mind , but unsure of the view of the leadership of our union , given the views quoted to them in the press as their own . ###My own view is that the fate of working people , the trade unions and the Labour Party are one and the same and that any attempt to weaken links between us condemns us all to the same failure . 
187245:52	###Dave , Lancashire Region . ###Last time today . 
187254:9	###I also have seen in Oldham near where I live , where an M P was imposed on that was held by Lamont for twenty two years , lived in Aberdeen I think it was , came to Oldham once a week to do his surgery and they put somebody in from the T N G . ###Do n't know how it happened , but he got there and he lives in London now . 
187266:16	###Mind you there 's a lot of Northern Ireland lads in London anyway , erm we think that when our members voted to return the political levy they also voted to continue to have a say in the running of the Labour Party . ###The Labour Party was set up by the trade unions and is still funded by the trade unions . 
187351:13	###That 's what 's shameful in our society and it 's only the Labour Party in unison with our movement that can right the wrongs of the past fourteen years . ###Comrades , what we are asking of the Party is quite simple , the extension of democracy . 
187408:83	###Billy Northern Region . ###President , colleagues . 
187417:16	###For fourteen years we have been bashed by the Tories , we have been led by a pound of poof T U C and as now it 's time to stand up and be counted . ###If the Labour Party , if the Labour Party want our money then we want some influence and we do n't , and we , and if they do n't want to represent the views of our members they can do without our money . 
187421:20	###Over the last fourteen years forty two million pounds and if they go on the way their going on and the way they 're talking it 's all gonna be for nicks nowt . ###Just think , colleagues , what we could have done with forty two million pounds , we could have had a conference twice a year not the biannual conference they 're on about . 
187447:26	###We 're speaking for working people in this country and we are a reliable indicator of the feelings , the dreams , the hopes of working people right across the country and any party that attempts to divorce itself from an organization such as ours , that attempts to speak for working people will lose its way . ###Now , there 's an , there 's an alternative being put forward as a compromise , but a a compromise is n't a compromise , the compromise as it looks er involving us , and we 're all Party members , as already indicated , as individuals and saying top up , let 's top up , we 're already paying are n't we , the political levy , let 's pay a bit more , right , is actually one that reduces our input as an organization . 
187464:111	###Old age pensions , compensation for accidents and injuries at work , free education for all children , the National Health Service , legislation regarding unfair dismissal and the nationwide public transport . ###After fourteen years of Tory rule all these and many other achievements are seriously threatened . 
187484:13	###Defence contractors Rolls Royce gave sixty thousand pounds , while United Newspapers , owners of the Express and the Star upped their donation last year . ###These people have the audacity to question our links , our legitimate links with our Party . 
187498:34	###They suggest we support a reformed electoral college for the next round of selection , every transition towards the use of the register of Labour supporters for subsequent selection . ###I think we should say here and now that we support option one B , registered supporters as a compromise . 
187520:15	###They may have been intending to talk about reform of the Labour Party constitution , but what ordinary trade unionists heard was senior members of the Party talking as if they were ashamed of the trade union connection . ###That was what came through and that 's what we all deplore . 
187570:61	###Liverpool City Council last year sacked hundreds of G M B members . ###Industrial tribunals as we heard yesterday from Ian have decided they were wrongly dismissed and that indicates the standard of the union locally but poses the question of why it was impossible for our officials , from the General Secretary downwards , to effect any influence whatsoever on the attitude of Liverpool City Council . 
187601:7	###Without any of us there would be no Labour Party . ###A party without influence , a party with opposition to even talk about . 
187604:11	###To encourage recruitment is not to price out existing members , not to prevent a possible mass membership , and although we encourage our members to join , we encourage family and friends also . ###When we 're given the price tag , eighteen pounds , that 's a different matter . 
187628:23	###The Party is dependent upon its activists , no more so than at elections . ###Can we afford for the activists to be priced out of the Party ? 
187629:27	###Can we afford for the activists to be priced out of the Party ? ###We all are aware that funds have to be generated but it , it causes a lot of membership . 
187644:7	###Unfortunately , we do not have any reason merit awards as such . ###With a reply like that it would have been a waste of time and effort to pursue the issue . 
187675:190	###The remaining er , eleven erm , on the delegation were made up of General Secretary , Deputy General Secretary , elected national officers and a few senior staff . ###These people were needed to give advice on policy and industrial matters . 
187735:13	###By making our benefits and services as attractive as possible it will encourage our members to stay with the G M B regardless of where they work . ###Also we could recruit new members in other workplaces who will be aware of what the G M B provides . 
187736:22	###Also we could recruit new members in other workplaces who will be aware of what the G M B provides . ###Colleagues , we must not forget the low paid and the part-time workers , the majority of whom are women . 
187744:63	###With that burden around us we have seen a reduction in the number of full-time officers being appointed by the union and which in turn has without any doubt had a detrimental effect upon the members who we serve . ###It is for that very reason that I am moving this motion today as it gives us the opportunity to implement the rules of the union and at the same time would enable us to put into position , people who would be able to do all those things that are necessary to achieve what we require , recruitment , organization , paperwork , back-up service to full-time officials . 
187744:67	###With that burden around us we have seen a reduction in the number of full-time officers being appointed by the union and which in turn has without any doubt had a detrimental effect upon the members who we serve . ###It is for that very reason that I am moving this motion today as it gives us the opportunity to implement the rules of the union and at the same time would enable us to put into position , people who would be able to do all those things that are necessary to achieve what we require , recruitment , organization , paperwork , back-up service to full-time officials . 
187749:70	###Conference , I believe that this existing rule nineteen , gives the G M B an opportunity to expand into branch administration officers across all the regions and use them to do any job that is needed and expected by the members . ###Conference , I believe that we can succeed if you are prepared to support this motion and I will leave you with this point . 
187793:67	###Bearing those points in mind one seven eight offers a better way forward to use the skills and experience of our lay officials and members . ###Motion one seven seven , of course we accept in principle , that where we have vacancies , permanent vacancies , we should employ direct staff and if possible our members , which we do try to do . 
187853:86	###Denise from the Southwestern Region . ###I 'm here to talk about the rule which applies to appeals procedures for members . 
187861:52	###The rulebook states that a member has the right to appeal but it does n't say that they have the right to be told why they 've lost . ###What this meal means in real terms is a member does n't necessarily know for sure why they have lost . 
187863:74	###They would obviously have some idea from the appeal hearing it itself but since they have to put all of their reasons for their request in writing the very least I believe they should be able to have is a reasoned reply . ###I 'd like to demonstrate this by reading a little bit from a letter that was sent to one of our members in this position . 
187886:76	###Motion six , rule amendment , to be moved by South Western Motion six . ###Sorry , I was dozing off over there . 
187895:12	###Because we need that new rule what is happening at the moment ? ###If a branch does n't like something what does it get the chance to do ? 
187896:88	###If a branch does n't like something what does it get the chance to do ? ###Well , it has to borrow rule six , that we were talking about just now . 
187902:82	###It 's not a rare occurrence because the General Secretary himself says , we 've followed this procedure on many occasions in the past . ###If it 's happening so often then should we not be having our own procedure for that to happen ? 
187904:33	###If we look at rule six , and we 've all been given rulebooks , if people have brought them with us , what we have to do is bend that rule so that it applies to branches , not members . ###What I 'll do is I 'll read you the first paragraph of rule six and actually bend the rule and put those words in and it really does n't make any sense at all , so listen carefully on this one and do n't be surprised if you do n't understand me . 
187904:59	###If we look at rule six , and we 've all been given rulebooks , if people have brought them with us , what we have to do is bend that rule so that it applies to branches , not members . ###What I 'll do is I 'll read you the first paragraph of rule six and actually bend the rule and put those words in and it really does n't make any sense at all , so listen carefully on this one and do n't be surprised if you do n't understand me . 
187999:53	###And that 's left us in some er , difficulties frankly , because one of the things that er , the C E C was recommending , that work of a strategic nature , which at the moment is undertaken by industrial conferences should be moved over to be dealt with by section conferences and that meant that a number of industrial conferences need not meet any longer , so we would avoid the duplication , the overlap and the waste . ###The solution of course is obvious , this year the C E C , no doubt suitably chastened by the vote last year , is resubmitting the section and industrial conference proposals on their own , without any other issues attached . 
188007:68	###They are industrial sections concerned with what is happening in a particular industry , or a group of industries . ###That 's of course why section conferences cannot debate matters reserved to Congress and why national committees cannot cons consider issues within the remit of the C E C . 
188007:89	###They are industrial sections concerned with what is happening in a particular industry , or a group of industries . ###That 's of course why section conferences cannot debate matters reserved to Congress and why national committees cannot cons consider issues within the remit of the C E C . 
188008:8	###That 's of course why section conferences cannot debate matters reserved to Congress and why national committees cannot cons consider issues within the remit of the C E C . ###They are concerned with the industry and the section of industry alone , but of course the issue that we then have to deal with is , we must make sure that those section committees , those national section committees , carry credibility with the members working in that section . 
188008:24	###That 's of course why section conferences cannot debate matters reserved to Congress and why national committees cannot cons consider issues within the remit of the C E C . ###They are concerned with the industry and the section of industry alone , but of course the issue that we then have to deal with is , we must make sure that those section committees , those national section committees , carry credibility with the members working in that section . 
188015:74	###Of course not , they 've been elected for a period , they serve to the end of that period , whether they 're made redundant or not , so they go on for the four year term . ###And also , of course , we 've so worded the er , amendment to rule to ensure that anybody who does any work in the sector in the eighteen months before the election period , even of a temporary nature , will be eligible to stand as a member of the section committee . 
188053:13	###Thanks Mr Chairman . ###Colleagues , Alan , Lancashire Region , opposing motion one one A on behalf of Lancashire Region . 
188055:62	###Colleagues , I must oppose this rule amendment . ###If passed anyone not in employment for eighteen months prior to nomination will not be eligible to attend any sectional conference . 
188179:10	###It 's not a matter for ruling people out because they 've become unemployed , through no fault of their own , absolutely not . ###So I 've gotta say , that in terms of credibility it 's , and the Regional Sec er , the General Secretary made the point about credibility within those sections , and within that , those elections , it 's for the branches to , to actually decide who represents them credibly or not and for this , for any attempt to change rule in this particular way . 
188194:16	###A very good concept and is probably working . ###The difficulty seems to arise within the membership in knowing exactly what areas of responsibility each section has , what are the rules of debate for sectional conferences , are decisions taken at sectional conferences binding on the union rulebook relating to that section and within all of this sectionalization , what role does the Apex conference now play , as those members , like myself , are presumably within one of the other sections too . 
188230:32	###Nevertheless , I am concerned in three areas . ###The first and the most important is accountability of this Congress . 
188241:23	###We 've had the debate over whether or not we want our annual conference and that argument was won . ###Despite the cost we voted for our annual conference and I have a feeling the argument will be back again some time in the future , based on the fact of having sectional conferences and an annual congress , the cost is too high . 
188241:50	###We 've had the debate over whether or not we want our annual conference and that argument was won . ###Despite the cost we voted for our annual conference and I have a feeling the argument will be back again some time in the future , based on the fact of having sectional conferences and an annual congress , the cost is too high . 
188261:10	###Colleagues , this document is surely the way forward for a progressive union which represents so many , many members spread over all aspects of industry . ###And in the scope and authority section of the document it gives the right for section conferences to have the authority to discuss and decide strategic issues affecting their industries . 
188319:44	###Er , colleagues , Congress ninety two defeated the special report on Wider Democracy as is mentioned in this report and as John has previously mentioned . ###Er , and it was plainly obvious why . 
188359:44	###We know that in this day and age it 's unworkable . ###Congress , please , careful on how you vote . 
188364:10	###Ian , Liverpool , North Wales and Irish Region . ###Our region 's got a free vote on this document so in that sense I 'm not necessarily expressing the views of the region . 
188395:197	###The cost , there is no doubt the section conferences will cost money . ###That was a point made very strongly last year . 
188403:10	###Regional delegate conferences . ###Well , we 're going to try to provide the first steps towards uniformity . 
188411:38	###There 's no point in trying to fudge this , you can only have one governing body and this is it . ###If you try and fudge it and set up three or four , say they can all discuss the same thing , you are building in the ability for major conflicts . 
188414:11	###If they want to establish questions of industrial concern , they should get themselves elected to the section conferences . ###I know there 's some unhappiness in the Apex conference about the way things went in the past , I give this small amount of advice . 
188416:29	###The Apex conference must come to terms with the nature of that amalgamation and that said that the Apex conference would concern itself with matters of interest to white collar workers . ###Matters of general interest have always been reserved here . 
188423:25	###On the other , just wait a moment and we 'll come to the other side of the argument because the argument is carefully and evenly balanced . ###The other side of the argument is this . 
188429:45	###The question does n't apply in respect of the conferences . ###We 've said people can go to the conferences with the right to speak , not the right to vote , because that principle applies , but the right to speak . 
188489:7	###Our union , Congress , cannot stand back and witness thousands of public servants , many of them our members , become yet another statistic in the unemployment figures . ###As a union we need to build a broad coalition with the providers and the users of public services and if necessary , with the employers . 
188491:7	###We have got to protect not only our members ' rights , but our public services , and from this conference today we 've got to make it quite clear , to central government , that we demand investment in our public services . ###We demand investment in the infrastructure . 
188510:18	###I would suggest to this conference and more importantly to this government , that that is no way to lift this country out of the recession and it 's no way for us to run an economy . ###And now we hear rumours that Lamont 's successor is now actually talking about extending that pay restraint into nineteen ninety four . 
188518:61	###That 's not the case now colleagues . ###Government appointees , over forty thousand a lot of them Tory grandees or supporters of the Tory Party , now populate unelected quangos which control many of our public services . 
188522:11	###Our union with its long and its proud history in the public sector does not seek confrontation . ###We seek cooperation . 
188575:33	###Mick , Mick , just one second . ###Colleagues , let 's keep it quiet please . 
188576:7	###Colleagues , let 's keep it quiet please . ###regardless of the inconvenience to their customers who might have to travel further afield , away from their homes and communities for treatment . 
188584:90	###Like you , on occasions my family and I , along with my parents , have had the benefits of being able to use the National Health Service free of any ongoing financial burden to the family . ###There is an opportunity now on the fifth of July , when this may well be our last chance to demonstrate , all of us , along with health service workers , cos they ca n't do it on they o on their own . 
188659:7	###That 's the sort of thing that 's going on at the moment . ###I could go on and on and on . 
188662:105	###There 's no way that child should have died , but you know what these famous words in real terms , in real terms we are putting more money into the Health Service . ###The people who are putting money in the Health Service , I do n't care whatever city you go to , you will see an appeal for a new kidney machine , a new special baby care unit , you 're the people , the public are putting the money in , because they 're certainly not . 
188691:38	###Major , I also mean my man , his decisions and bed closures courts disaster . ###Patient care will suffer , demand for care will increase and er , primary care will this point again and again . 
188702:7	###They have got it wrong . ###Help to put it right . 
188748:9	###Today in Britain , Michael is looking for ways to make people take out private insurance against all sorts of possibilities . ###Poverty in old age is one . 
188852:48	###Erm , the partnership agreement er , arose from a clear conviction by both unions that positive trade union action is better than rhetoric . ###That it is inadequate for trade unions to merely pay lip service to a European prospective , or to be deterred by the refusal of the U K government to accept its European responsibilities and deny rights to U K workers that are enjoyed by every one of our European colleagues . 
188853:109	###That it is inadequate for trade unions to merely pay lip service to a European prospective , or to be deterred by the refusal of the U K government to accept its European responsibilities and deny rights to U K workers that are enjoyed by every one of our European colleagues . ###We assert that strong trade union relationships , on a day to day basis , must be developed in a bilateral form and this agreement provides for substantial trade union cooperation in the European Community and beyond , and it 's already materially advancing the interests of our members and assisting the development of free and independent trade unionism in Eastern and Central Europe and the former Soviet Republics . 
188889:10	###We 've had problems at Allbright and Wilsons for some time on a change of working pattern , but this is just a modern way that companies have got today of de-manning people . ###Now , we got permission to go ahead with a , a ballot for industrial action , which took place and although it was a majority for industrial action , it was n't the required two thirds majority . 
188903:24	###Keith . ###Yes , President , Congress . 
188905:18	###In answer , first of all I must thank Ken for er , his erm , his comments . ###Erm , the delegate from Northern Region referring to Allbright and Wilson . 
188911:59	###I 'm glad that you commented er , so favourably about brother Hayes ' er , attendance at your headquarters conference because , of course , brother Hayes is acting on my behalf in that capacity . ###When you ask what happens at national level , well what happens at national level in these industries is that we have dozens and dozens of requests for headquarters conferences each year . 
188924:53	###Many may they come back . ###Thank you . 
188955:34	###The G M B and the trade union generally need to have at least the resources the management have . ###How can we do this I hear you say . 
188956:11	###How can we do this I hear you say . ###Firstly , the primary objective for us as a trade union must to be ensure G M B activists , shop stewards and officials all have access to training and computer literacy . 
188989:48	###We 're in Europe , our role in Europe can only increase . ###What we should be looking at is how to maximum our potential to further the trade union interests in the process of European integration , because one thing 's for sure . 
188991:7	###If the evolution of the E C continues , and it will , working people must be as organized as possible to ensure that trade unions are not forgotten in the race for a single market . ###So how do we get organized ? 
188995:7	###This union aims at increasing the skills of its members with various training and education schemes . ###Let 's look at how we can get tr language training incorporated into these schemes to give , particularly our young members , an additional skill to use in their trade union work . 
188996:7	###Let 's look at how we can get tr language training incorporated into these schemes to give , particularly our young members , an additional skill to use in their trade union work . ###We must work together in Europe , colleagues . 
189017:7	###The T U C courses that are equally under threat , as pum public funding is withdrawn from them . ###The reality is the T U C provides training for more G M B representatives than does our own training programme and very often at considerably less , less cost , and certainly in my region , where we have a very close relationship with the T U , T U C , the training is of a very high standard . 
189049:57	###The first line of defence for the trade union movement is you . ###You 're the ones who defend the grievances and the disciplines , you 're the ones who prepare the information for the industrial tribunals and there 's no doubt about it , comrades , this one is aimed at you , the representatives . 
189138:37	###People like me in the past used to rail that we had commercial enterprises using the college . ###I 'll accept that , if we can nick some money from the private sector to educate our activists , so be it . 
189216:52	###As I mentioned to you on Sunday morning we usually deal with , usually deal with this particular matter on Sunday morning , but we decided that because our new young members ' section is growing in its influence and activity and , of course , we now have resolutions on the agenda that this now warranted er , separate attention er , on the agenda . ###And I refer , of course , to the G M B youth award . 
189252:33	###He was on the scheme for a year and then stayed as a trainee earning thirty pounds a week . ###He stuck this out for three years and finally qualified as an electrician in his own right . 
189256:7	###We can all think of other examples . ###Colleagues , young people need the special and particular protection of the unions . 
189277:7	###, G M B Scotland , moving motion two four eight . ###President , Congress . 
189284:16	###According to a Labour Par a Labour Party survey based on information from Scotland 's job centres , eighteen to twenty few twenty four year old out of work has risen by twenty eight percent since nineteen ninety . ###Many youngsters have never known the satisfaction of being handed a wage packet and it can be so soul destroying for them . 
189290:7	###Every region round the country now has a regional advisory youth committee and nearly all has an annual youth conference . ###More training of young members should be provided as well as distribution of literature aimed at young people . 
189291:7	###More training of young members should be provided as well as distribution of literature aimed at young people . ###We must encourage a youth to become shop stewards and safety representatives . 
189319:42	###President , Congress . ###The C E C is asking you to support composite nine , motion two four eight and refer motion four three four . 
189335:109	###So that 's the first difference between participatory model and Russo 's model there 's much more room for debate and consequent toleration of minority . ###Secondly , it gives up the distinction between sovereign and the executive in the sense that the people are not restricted only to making laws , but they can also get involved in decisions about particular acts of will . 
189340:15	###Now I discussed three objections to the participatory model last week . ###The first one is John Stuart Mill 's objection which is that we ca n't leave everything to the people . 
189342:8	###At some point individuals must administer , you ca n't have a committee carrying out the ###committee . 
189357:29	###At some point we need administrators to carry out the will of the people . ###Now the defenders of participatory democracy would consider this as a very weak objection . 
189357:48	###At some point we need administrators to carry out the will of the people . ###Now the defenders of participatory democracy would consider this as a very weak objection . 
189357:181	###At some point we need administrators to carry out the will of the people . ###Now the defenders of participatory democracy would consider this as a very weak objection . 
189375:7	###Well and we have seen one response for people now making Mill that is that his objections are not being finessed by computer technology , they do n't want to get back into that type of argument , because this is really not the most important argument against direct democracy . ###To understand Mill 's view or at least to see why Mill makes the argument he does make , er I E not just the argument but other arguments which represent democracy . 
189379:10	###There are two things that governments ought to be doing . ###Firstly they ought to improve the citizens , both morally and intellectually , so it 's the role of the government to make better citizens . 
189379:54	###There are two things that governments ought to be doing . ###Firstly they ought to improve the citizens , both morally and intellectually , so it 's the role of the government to make better citizens . 
189399:9	###So here he has erm quite a long discussion in the fact that if you have inexperienced people , they will often make the make a quick initial assessment of a situation which is being and rejected by a more experienced person . ###So the experienced person will always be able to take the inexperienced person , it 's not as simple as that , but if you make the administrators responsible to the people in all their decisions , then you have as Mill says inexperience sitting in judgment on experience , ignorance sitting in judgment on knowledge . 
189400:12	###So the experienced person will always be able to take the inexperienced person , it 's not as simple as that , but if you make the administrators responsible to the people in all their decisions , then you have as Mill says inexperience sitting in judgment on experience , ignorance sitting in judgment on knowledge . ###So you have to insulate the , the administrators from direct control of the people if you , if the administrators are going to make good decisions . 
189409:66	###Now Russo then representative democracy is n't a refinement of democracy to make it appropriate for the modern world , but a way of giving away all the merits of democracy . ###Now Mill accepts that representative democracy can be as bad as Russo supposes it is , but there are aspects of Mill 's views which make him sound very much like Russo as well . 
189501:109	###There 's a further point that the effects of the policy may not strike in the first generation anyway , it may be long-term before er equalization of property has the effect and other things so these people might , might vote in their own class interest against the interest of future generations . ###In fact one thing he says er which might make you doubt his motives somewhat is that the reason for giving people more than one vote is that they 're more educated , but in general there is also a rough correlation between property ownership and education and so there 's a good reason to give the property owners more than one vote , people who own a lot of property more than one vote . 
189506:88	###Well what this springs up is the issue , one of the issues we started with which is democracy in the tyranny of the majority is what Mill recognizes is is that a maj well he claims to be concerned that the majority will make a decision which is against the interests of everyone , but he 's equally concerned about the issue that the majority might make a decision which is against the interests just of a picked-on minority , people with unpopular views , people who hold er members of a different religion and so on . ###So erm Mill wants to protect minority from within the democratic procedure , that is he wants to set up erm a system of democracy which is as it were proof against majority corruption . 
189516:51	###So how can we defend the system that we 've got ? ###Well , it seems that none of the arguments that have been used so far would come close to defending the type of system that we 've got . 
189519:89	###The best I think we can say about our scheme is something that Brian Barry argues . ###It 's in a paper I did n't put on the reading list because most of it is not relevant , it 's called Is Democracy Special ? and this in his collective papers . 
189622:91	###Zero , zero , one niner ###These are obviously the ones that do n't fly anyway 
189695:12	###Are they ? ###Right . 
189720:26	###But why are they black ? ###Why should they be denigrated ? 
189729:44	###So , so this group , the clinical psychoanalysts , have n't really been , been interested in this , in this kind of writing . ###The other group of people who you might have thought , ought to have taken them up and been interested in them , was the wider field of social science , er , writers after all , social scientists , ought to be interested in these , in these books because they 're about social science . 
189767:9	###If you read Totem and Taboo , and I , by the way I do expect all of you er to read it , because it is one of the set er books , and one of the things I 'm not gonna do in these lectures on the black books , is to tell you what the book says , and just kind of repeat it in the lecture . ###I mean this is a waste of my time , it , it should be a waste of your time , if you 're gonna read the book , and we 've already had both classes on Totem and Taboo . 
189782:40	###James Frazer was a Cambridge anthropologist , who wrote er , a number of books , most notably , The Golden Bough , an enormous er , volume , I think it runs to , to thirteen volumes . ###One of the few things , erm , that I 'm really proud of about myself , is that I 've read all of them . 
189830:13	###Taboo is a Polynesian word , and it means some kind of supernatural law or prohibition which you infringe at your supernatural peril . ###If you infringe a taboo something terrible will , will happen to you . 
189830:31	###Taboo is a Polynesian word , and it means some kind of supernatural law or prohibition which you infringe at your supernatural peril . ###If you infringe a taboo something terrible will , will happen to you . 
189839:7	###Well if you do it , they just shout at you . ###It 's so they can open the door behind them , the passengers getting in on that side of the road . 
189922:88	###So although we know this today , very few people knew it in nineteen thirteen , and er , nobody knew it before the turn of the century . ###So when people talk about Freud 's Lamarckism , they 're not talking about what Darwin and Freud understood as Lamarckism , evolution by will , with progressive improvement , what they 're talking about is what everybody believed to be true , the inheritance of acquired characteristics . 
190000:73	###for the benefit of these two , there 's only a couple of sentences ###Yes . 
190038:37	###Well let , let , let , let me tell you , I do n't want to put you on the spot , the , the , the analogy is of er the typical pattern of development of a neurosis , which Freud says is a trauma that happens often in infancy . ###This is then forgotten or repressed when it seems to have vanished altogether and there 's a third period , what Freud calls the return of the repressed when the initial trauma comes back in the form of symptoms and er ideally in the form of an analysis that finally brings it to the surface of consciousness and dissolves it , and this is a typical pattern . 
190065:88	###because they were all repressed but they were fighting against this repression and it was coming out , you know . ###Yes . 
190077:39	###well Akhenaten took it even further and it was an offence punishable by death to even say the word gods and if you visit Ancient Egypt and walk around the ruins , you will occasionally know they were fond of putting these hieroglyphic erm er inscriptions over everything . ###And here and there you will see hieroglyphs have been erased , if somebody 's got a chisel and there 's a , just a raise a whole block of hieroglyphs , er just there and then and almost always that is Akhenaten 's workmen did it and the hieroglyphs they were erasing was the plural er gods . 
190095:134	###Erm well ###I mean how does it , how does it work psychologically ? 
190098:21	###It was symbolic ###Why should they want to be heard in a traditional way , you 'd think students having a revolution will want everything make a kind of clean clean break would n't they ? 
190098:160	###It was symbolic ###Why should they want to be heard in a traditional way , you 'd think students having a revolution will want everything make a kind of clean clean break would n't they ? 
190214:78	###What do these myths about Moses who is the key figure in Judaism , what do these myths really tell us ? ###So from that biblical scores have concluded , the book that we know as Genesis was originally two accounts that were pushed together but not very expert actually , because you can still see the join , an and Freud 's view about the Moses there are numerous discrepancies and numerous joins and if you take it all apart and say what is it , what does it make up , his conclusion is that erm Moses was , was not Egyptian , sorry Moses was not er erm no not , not a Hebrew but Egyptian . 
190277:31	###Well it 's an interesting thesis . ###As I said I 'll be having quite a lot to say about in the lectures , so we 'll just regard this class as a kind of prelude to that . 
190316:23	###When investing offspring , when investing offspring results in increased males stay together , but if it is possible to reach by deserting a partner , then the individual is likely to be erm you ca n't decide on based on potential opportunities made parental investment . ###because of the those offspring can survive without further parental investment and if parental investment is therefore . 
190324:31	###The resident male who was displaced then comes back and looks after all the eggs , including those of the pirate and the reason he does it presumably in the first place he ca n't distinguish which eggs he 's fertilized and those fertilized by the pirate and secondly , he knows he 's fertilized some of the eggs and therefore it pays him to stay and look after all of them . ###So erm in other words i it wou would depend on the circumstances on how much has already been invested . 
190325:134	###So erm in other words i it wou would depend on the circumstances on how much has already been invested . ###In the case of human beings of course you have to notice that men seem to have an advantage because as I think I mention i in the lectures , it 's perfectly possible , you see this happening in our own society which is supposed to be monogamous , perfectly possible for a man to get married , raise a family and then in his forties to desert his wife and raise a second family . 
190326:31	###In the case of human beings of course you have to notice that men seem to have an advantage because as I think I mention i in the lectures , it 's perfectly possible , you see this happening in our own society which is supposed to be monogamous , perfectly possible for a man to get married , raise a family and then in his forties to desert his wife and raise a second family . ###It 's paradoxical because often divorce law reforms thought of as favouring women and in circumspect that allows women to get away from an unreasonable husband and that kind of thing , it 's certainly true , but at the same time you have to notice that in terms of reproductive success it may benefit more er men more . 
190339:143	###erm the er ###but you see the point I 'm making , in our species males do contribute . 
190340:142	###but you see the point I 'm making , in our species males do contribute . ###Now , this contribution is not direct , it 's indirect in the sense that males , a male for example who is provisioning a wife who is pregnant is not directly invent investing in the offspring clearly you ca n't do that she has to do that , cos the offspring 's inside her body , but indirectly he may be feeding his wife , protecting her and providing for her in , in a way that is absolutely critical to her reproductive success too . 
190340:153	###but you see the point I 'm making , in our species males do contribute . ###Now , this contribution is not direct , it 's indirect in the sense that males , a male for example who is provisioning a wife who is pregnant is not directly invent investing in the offspring clearly you ca n't do that she has to do that , cos the offspring 's inside her body , but indirectly he may be feeding his wife , protecting her and providing for her in , in a way that is absolutely critical to her reproductive success too .

190426:16	###In fact you wo n't get any sexually mature erm er woman to have er any relationship with men , unofficial or otherwise if you 're not initiated because they 'll just say you 're a boy and , and er and er an adult woman would feel it was demeaning you know to sleep with a mere boy , she 'd insist you 've got to be a man and to be a man you normally got to be initiated and that normally means being circumcised . ###Now the , the initiations are controlled by the elder men who have all , all the wives and if you do n't behave and join the club and conform to what th the crown elders expect , you wo n't get initiated and i if you do n't unless you say you wo n't get any wives and the guys who are doing the initiating the initiated are the very same guys who have all the daughters . 
190437:159	###Er very often Australian Aboriginal societies you meet men the corroborees at these ritual gatherings and if you 're one of the club , then in the ritual they 'll tell you , they 'll say hey , you know , you know you know you say where did you get all these kangaroos you know oh we got them over at the so and so ranges or down at the so and so water hole that 's where they all are this week , and this is very important information for man . ###If you 're not a member of the club and you 're not accepted the rituals and people do n't like you , they wo n't tell you and as a result you wo n't be an effective hunter , you wo n't be able to support many wives even if you wanted them and if you have wives what they needed , because if a man does n't feed his wives they , they , they all eventually get up and go , they 'll say two fingers you know , you ca n't feed us . 
190442:43	###So it , it 's as you say it 's a very tough , hard life and in order to survive , people really do need the help of other people and that 's why you 've really got to conform to a large extent in the society and you have n't got a lot of choice about erm you know wh what you 'd like to especially if you 're , if you 're young and female and not much men not if you want to get any wives that is . ###So the erm but as , but as Katherine reminds us , I mean if , if that 's the kind of life our emotional parameters are my , my guess is that that , is that that 's probably the truth , certainly a persuasive argument . 
190450:30	###Well , I 'm , I 'm a supporter of it , which you know erm it , it strikes me being far more effective than other forms er of er explanation . ###How much ice does it cut in the modern industrial society ? 
190452:48	###I think , I think it think it must cut quite a lot because I mean there 's certain I do n't these biological constraints . ###How would they show themselves I mean ? 
190452:72	###I think , I think it think it must cut quite a lot because I mean there 's certain I do n't these biological constraints . ###How would they show themselves I mean ? 
190453:41	###How would they show themselves I mean ? ###What people to look you know in the modern society women do n't have to rely on men or do n't have to have traditional sex roles , this is a point of view is n't it ? 
190454:130	###What people to look you know in the modern society women do n't have to rely on men or do n't have to have traditional sex roles , this is a point of view is n't it ? ###Well I think er I think , well I think you have to have , I mean I do n't really parental investment and stuff like that gestation period . 
190461:10	###Or if you look at it another way that is men and women are equal and we have n't yet got round that they are very different but they are equal . ###I dunno , er you know you can put woman staying at home having the child for instance when there are n't enough children to fill the schools realize that having children is a very important in economic values what with nations increasing staying at home 
190480:36	###and another argument which is that ###However if you say erm oh well you know erm boys will be boys that 's natural , tha that sounds as if you 're kind of making excuses for them and condoning them , so I think you 've got to be very careful about how you use the word natural and clearly it raises the whole question of how far you can , you can push erm cultural ideals against natural constraints an and what really is the issue . 
190541:15	###No . ###Right , let 's , let 's do that first cos that 's important . 
190574:73	###Okay , off you go now . ###Well done , excellent . 
190597:128	###Because there 's quite a list of them and I think they explain many of the descriptive characteristics of o of goods or that Freud refers to . ###That 's certainly true and in a sense that 's the most obvious thing is n't it ? 
190597:240	###Because there 's quite a list of them and I think they explain many of the descriptive characteristics of o of goods or that Freud refers to . ###That 's certainly true and in a sense that 's the most obvious thing is n't it ? 
190599:14	###The leader as always is er is a directive agency , the leader as it were erm takes over the individual self-determination by erm effectively telling telling the good what to do erm how can this er does this have to be in in one direction only I mean one gets the feelings very often you know you see things in the newspaper crowd hysteria and so on , erm do crowds always have to become kind of primitive and regressed or or can leaders influence them in other directions ? ###Cos certainly you , sometimes you get the feeling do n't you that okay being in the crowd or the group may reduce people 's self-determination and self control , but the result is mayhem . 
190601:19	###So does that always have to happen ? ###Well what would you say Joy , because you did touch on this in your , in your comments ? 
190608:7	###I mean I , I do n't feel comfortable talking I 'm talking in a whole group I do n't feel quite as comfortable not actually here , but in , in a debate situation talking to say two or three people . ###Yes . 
190650:9	###You get your own ego to face up to its own problems and to make its own decisions , er as I mentioned before a very painful process and a , and a , and a rather gruelling one . ###So it seems to me that you cannot do analysis in a group because by definition the ego of a person in a group is , is detracted from , whereas in individual psychoanalysis and ideally the ego of the person is added to and enlarged to give them more competence by being made to face up to its repressions . 
190651:176	###So it seems to me that you cannot do analysis in a group because by definition the ego of a person in a group is , is detracted from , whereas in individual psychoanalysis and ideally the ego of the person is added to and enlarged to give them more competence by being made to face up to its repressions . ###So I must say I entirely agree with Heather on this , it seems to me inevitable logic of Freud 's theory and erm my own view is that group psychoanalysis is a contradiction in terms , you cannot do psychoanalysis in a group of this and those who say they can I think have n never understood what psychoanalysis is all about and are misleading the public and people pay good money for it . 
190670:52	###yes . ###And so if they er when normally there 's only one reason . 
190715:18	###What kind of libido are we talking about ? ###Because here I think we see one of the chief reasons why Freud adopted the term libido and why when we talked about libido through last term I said we would see that there were some very good reasons in Freud 's erm application of his ideas to society for having this libido and that now we 've come to it , what what kind of libido are Dean and Duncan talking about ? 
190725:269	###That 's right . ###That 's right . 
190753:49	###Well that does n't mean very much . ###Does that answer your question ? 
190759:24	###Well , yes sorry perhaps I myself . ###I meant not in the same way . 
190768:22	###Oh , it does , oh it does yes . ###An astonishing fact . 
190768:56	###Oh , it does , oh it does yes . ###An astonishing fact . 
190776:53	###Just pass that round , that 's last week 's summary . ###Today 's lecture is on erm what you might call female interest in sex and in particular in in the concept of erm female choice and I was struck er this morning by looking at Nature . 
190818:50	###Another interesting erm angle on this is , is anorexia nervosa . ###Anorexia is a relatively modern illness er the first descriptions of it are found in the nineteenth century and today it 's er by no means an uncommon illness in er mainly in young women , very occasionally in men , but , but er y it 's more or less safe to say it 's er it 's a disease of er women and almost always younger women . 
190824:51	###In other words fat issue it 's probably an issue . ###Now erm all this really goes back to eighteen seventy one . 
190828:69	###So a modern sexual dimorphism is explicable in terms of erm inter-male er conflict and it may be in the case of human beings er most of them are , for example the larger body weight of males that we saw when we looked at sexual dimorphism in human beings is probably explicable erm in terms of inter-male conflict like it is in chimpanzees . ###Er my guess is that beards may be the same . 
190872:136	###This is un the top , the top one , well and the bottom one , unsuccessful mounting attempts by male jackals , sorry hyenas , male hyenas on , on a female . ###The female erm just does n't want to know . 
190873:245	###The female erm just does n't want to know . ###In fact this is more interesting than you may think because female hyenas have a pseudo-penis , they have , they have a pseudo-scrotum and a pseudo-penis , reasons which are n't fully understood and in order to mate , the male has to insert his real penis into the female pseudo-penis in order to reach her her genital and it 's a bit complicated . 
190874:9	###In fact this is more interesting than you may think because female hyenas have a pseudo-penis , they have , they have a pseudo-scrotum and a pseudo-penis , reasons which are n't fully understood and in order to mate , the male has to insert his real penis into the female pseudo-penis in order to reach her her genital and it 's a bit complicated . ###So if the female does n't want it and this one clearly does n't , she just sits down and if she sits on her pseudo-penis , there 's no way the male is ever gonna get into her , but in fact this is true er in , in general terms of er if you think about it a , a female quadrupedal mammal I mean it looks like male domination , the male mounts and it looks as if she has to submit but she does n't . 
190876:197	###All she has to do is to walk away , he ca n't walk cos his fore legs are on her back back legs are on the ground . ###If she moves forward , there 's no way that he 's gonna get anywhere with her . 
190878:182	###I remember making this point a couple of years ago , yeah I made this point last year and I showed these pictures , I spent about twenty minutes on it , the following week I was , I was libelously accused and it was a libel , it was a serious libel erm er that I , that I said that females always had to submit erm I was very angry about that . ###Pity it was n't in the national newspapers because my lawyer said I could have retired on the proceeds . 
190889:52	###In ten to fifteen percent of fertilized zygotes there will be no implantation and er forty two percent that do implant will fail to cycle and will be re-absorbed again . ###So it 's a very high proportion we 're talking about . 
190903:54	###So the implication of that study and it 's a rather astonishing one , although it fits exactly with , with the argument we 're developing is that because these , these women were living in very difficult circumstances , in prison , they were even more discriminating about the offspring they were actually and they did n't carry a single one to term that had a birth defect . ###So the idea is that the more difficult the the situation the mother finds herself is in the more likely she is to spontaneously abort and the more likely any retained er foetus is to be normal an and , and to , and not to have any defects . 
190903:86	###So the implication of that study and it 's a rather astonishing one , although it fits exactly with , with the argument we 're developing is that because these , these women were living in very difficult circumstances , in prison , they were even more discriminating about the offspring they were actually and they did n't carry a single one to term that had a birth defect . ###So the idea is that the more difficult the the situation the mother finds herself is in the more likely she is to spontaneously abort and the more likely any retained er foetus is to be normal an and , and to , and not to have any defects . 
190909:21	###Seventy three percent in the first trimester , in other words the first three months are male . ###Now er let 's just accept that as a fact as we go by erm it looks as if mothers not only discriminate against un un unfit offspring , but also against males . 
190955:109	###nobody 's ###I , I mean it may not be right , but it , I mean as I think you can see it has a kind of logic about it , erm and , and i it may be that it , it 's not the right explanation , but the very fact that erm we 're suggesting it , I think shows that erm again it 's naive to think that motherhood is a kind of er is a one-sided affair where you know mothers sacrifice themselves er for their offspring , because nature demands it . 
190963:133	###Yes . ###Yes , but you see the , the , yes an and that of course is a is i is a good one . 
190970:111	###then you 're less likely ###Right . 
190991:101	###Were you gonna say something Sue ? ###Oh I think so , I mean I , again I hope there are n't any Catholics in the audience who are offended by my remarks , but it 's just my personal opinion , that yeah , th th you know , th th that is the case and at the least I mean whatever judgment one makes about this thing , I , I repeat what I said earlier about you gotta be terribly careful when using the word natural . 
191040:39	###But er in other words do n't worry if you do n't understand everything today when you do do it because we 'll go over it next erm next week in the lecture and we 'll be going over it in classes as well . ###Some of you have done a prisoner 's dilemma . 
191067:105	###And yet I do n't think there 's anybody in this room who could last a minute in a ring with a sumo wrestler because obviously being fit for sumo wrestling is quite different from being fit for sprint running , you need a completely different physique . ###So even in terms of sporting meaning of fitness , it means completely different things in different contexts , and it certainly means er different things in terms of evolution . 
191081:265	###Yeah , yeah , these are all straight out of Trivers . ###Erm , ratio of injuries to deaths er for all accidents as a function of age and sex , and again , you can see males have , males do a lot worse than females and I think there 's one more , no sorry that 's the lot . 
191108:15	###Because it 's , it 's completely wrong and misleading , and let 's instead talk about the ultimate bottom line in evolution which is reproductive success . ###Natural selection selects for reproductive success . 
191188:47	###Now admittedly , the T four bacterial is a very simple organism , it ca n't leap about so it does n't need senses or a brain to direct it , or muscles or anything like that , it ca n't repair itself or change itself once it 's been made , therefore it does n't need to digest food , er to , to have an immune system or anything like that to repair itself or put itself to rights , it does n't need anything like that . ###Erm , it 's a very very simplified organism . 
191211:120	###I know this is a bit of an affront to our high opinion of ourselves as human beings , er , of course many people regard it that way , but erm my view is that er we ca n't expect science necessarily to tell us things we want to hear . ###human fantasy and for our benefit . 
191216:82	###One of these base pairs erm another combination is substituted , either by , by er some kind of error in or by the influence of something like erm bac background radiation or some kind of chemical effect or something like that . ###A mutation means a single based change in the genetic code which may or may not have er ultimate consequences for the organism . 
191236:49	###about this myself because I think it 's complex . ###Sometimes I think both genes are used , sometimes only one , not the other , and I 'm not sure that anybody knows exactly how , how and why that works out but erm 
191287:30	###I now want to prove to you that this kind of evolution I 've been talking about , evolution by natural selection , at the level of individual genes , cannot produce social cooperation . ###The argument goes like this . 
191293:15	###Now , imagine what happens if a gene for altruism . ###What will happen in a population of selfish organisms ? 
191294:19	###What will happen in a population of selfish organisms ? ###By definition the gene must promote the reproductive success of the selfish organisms at a cost to itself but a gene for altruism could evolve in a population of selfish individuals a population of altruists , in whom a gene for selfishness appears by random mutation . 
191306:28	###If anybody wants Blind Watchmaker I have it here , ditto Evolvematic . ###Yes . 
191423:99	###What the analyst would say to you in trying to help you to resolve this dream would be , well , report what you think of in connection with the manifest content . ###In other words , friends at the school and the idea , as you said at the very beginning of your paper , is to report without any kind of erm censorship or judgment . 
191429:19	###Why ca n't ? ###Because it 
191430:7	###Because it ###You do , and you have to assume it 's right , whatever comes up . 
191432:102	###You have to assume it 's correct . ###It 's very difficult , you never lose the feeling of resistance to it . 
191433:50	###It 's very difficult , you never lose the feeling of resistance to it . ###I mean , I 've been analyzing every dream I can remember now for the last twenty one years and er I think I 've got rather good at dream interpretation I must admit . 
191485:208	###Right , absolutely . ###Well , in the first place you do n't of course , because the , the manifest content may be totally innocent . 
191602:21	###It 's a possibility that it 's related to some existing thought you 'd had . ###You know , how easy it would be drive off and , and kill yourself or something . 
191608:26	###Right , yeah . ###But is it necessary that he should fantasize about that beforehand ? 
191620:9	###so comfortable ###Really ? 
191645:10	###Okay . ###Thanks very much . 
191646:48	###Thanks very much . ###You 'll have to have another go in your dreams Theresa . 
191679:26	###Twelfth of November ? ###Mhm , oh no , it ca n't be the twelfth of November 
191680:66	###Mhm , oh no , it ca n't be the twelfth of November ###No , that 's the tutorial , it must be much later than that . 
191773:83	###The , another analogy that I find is quite useful for the ego is erm Captain Kirk on the bridge of the Enterprise , okay ? ###When you watch Star Trek , as I 'm sure you all do , none of you watch serious television I 'm sure . 
191775:15	###Erm , er , Jim is , Jim is sitting on in er on the flight deck of the Enterprise and he is the guy who has to make all the decisions . ###This is the great thing about Star Trek . 
191777:21	###Poor old Jim always has to make the decision because he is in command , okay ? ###The buck stops where Jim is sitting . 
191778:191	###The buck stops where Jim is sitting . ###And that 's what the ego has to do . 
191807:46	###Now , ###we shouldn we should n't get carried away , however , by this er focus on its managerial agencies , agency , and think that everything it does in this respect is conscious , because a lot of the processes that occur in the ego are actually not conscious . 
191815:42	###Erm , yes , that 's correct . ###Er , but , but and there are two buts here . 
191830:24	###Yes . ###Yes , but taking place in the unconscious mind . 
191870:53	###And she had given a certain name to it , and I ca n't remember what the name was now , something like fiddling , I mean fiddling is too obvious , it was n't that , but it was something like that , an ordinary everyday term like that . ###And she said that 's what I call you see . 
191889:18	###so , and we were repressing , repression was pushing into the unconscious , so does the unconscious still exist as a place where we repress everything ? ###Yes it does . 
191897:29	###Yeah , so the new one does n't replace the old one ? ###It does n't replace one , it overlaps it , it overlaps it . 
191943:36	###It 's not in the same tradition as , as , as the ego . ###Er , an analogy that I think helps to make this clear is that the ego after all is a managerial agency . 
191943:60	###It 's not in the same tradition as , as , as the ego . ###Er , an analogy that I think helps to make this clear is that the ego after all is a managerial agency . 
191946:38	###You 've either got to eat the cake , in which case you no longer have the cake , or you decide to preserve the cake , in which case you ca n't eat it . ###You ca n't do both at once . 
191949:33	###If you try to , the result is a disaster . ###Now , the id is not like that . 
191954:34	###It 's a bit like political parties who have no hope of ever being elected making wild promises . ###I mean , of course they can , they can make all sorts of wild promises and all kinds of crazy policies because they know they 'll never be called upon to carry them out . 
191971:19	###Well no , you see what 's happening there is , is a , a demand or a drive from the id is being gratified by the ego . ###What , Freud would regard that as a situation in which the ego had surrendered to the id and said okay eat the cake . 
191971:69	###Well no , you see what 's happening there is , is a , a demand or a drive from the id is being gratified by the ego . ###What , Freud would regard that as a situation in which the ego had surrendered to the id and said okay eat the cake . 
191972:65	###What , Freud would regard that as a situation in which the ego had surrendered to the id and said okay eat the cake . ###And of course the ego has to do that , I mean if you 're gonna stay alive , the ego has to take account of these internal demands . 
191993:82	###Of course , sometimes when that happens I mean the ego kind of gets carried away with it to some extent , but that 's all , you know that 's in the nature of the ego . ###It is I 'm afraid a rather , compared with the id , it 's a rather weak agency . 
192022:27	###It punishes er how does it punish the ego ? ###Yes , that 's right , yes . 
192051:80	###Yes . ###And again you would expect socialization and environmental factors to operate , and clearly they do in a trivial sense . 
192125:7	###And that happens and self-righteous people get like that . ###Folks , we 've come to five past eleven . 
192130:19	###Next week we start the second part of the course , our erm , our key as it were and we 'll look at the first one with er . ###Thanks very much . 
192133:109	###Okay now erm , there 's a slight change of plan because er following one or two of the classes last week I realized that erm I had n't made myself very well understood last week and er what came back from one or two people was rather garbled , and really it 's my own fault because I probably tried to do too much too quickly and as a result perhaps er did n't make myself clear . ###So , what I want to do is to er really repeat what I said last week but with a different emphasis . 
192134:28	###So , what I want to do is to er really repeat what I said last week but with a different emphasis . ###So what I intend to do from this week is that very thing , try and fill in as it were and er make up for what was n't covered in the classes because I must admit that this year I 've been struck by the high st high standard of the class presentations . 
192213:15	###So that is a quantitative objective scientific and ultimately measurable factor . ###Now admittedly in practice , measuring reproductive success is a damn sight more difficult than it seems . 
192255:56	###So females fight for males and plant their eggs in the male 's pouch if he is , if he is er if he is accessible . ###Then the male fertilizes the eggs once they are inside his pouch and then he looks after them until they hatch and the poor male staggers around with an enormous great pouch full of wriggling er baby sea horses until they 're finally born . 
192256:7	###Then the male fertilizes the eggs once they are inside his pouch and then he looks after them until they hatch and the poor male staggers around with an enormous great pouch full of wriggling er baby sea horses until they 're finally born . ###And he , erm , in fact puts in a greater investment than she does because he has to do the transportation , protection and everything . 
192296:35	###Supposing it did . ###Supposing that natural selection was rewarding behaviour which benefited the group . 
192330:39	###In the nineteen twenties the Darwinist , R A Fisher , solved the problem . ###Again it 's too complicated for me to go into the details of this . 
192432:32	###You ca n't say that males , females , the old or the young a are those who , who carry on their sexual role in a regular way , or those who do it in an irregular way have a privileged point of view . ###That would be a qualitative prejudicial judgment , the kind of judgment that social Darwinists went in for . 
192435:27	###It 's their genes that are struggling for reproductive success . ###Consequently , you cannot say that one individual has privileges over another . 
192442:52	###There 's nothing in our modern view of the evolution to say that one party has privileges over the , another . ###On the contrary , if the gene can pay for itself in terms of reproductive success , that is all that matters . 
192455:121	###So you see what I 've been , what I 've been trying to do in this lecture is to explain the , the modern biological basis which I think makes Freud 's findings intelligent . ###Because on otherwise they 're pretty unintelligible . 
192514:74	###The , the importance of this , is that Freud is often said to have been a Hobbesian thinker , in the sense that , er without necessarily being directly influenced by Hobbes , he took a similar , a similar kind of view , or at least , so it is said . ###You could say , that er , a Hobbesian view of human nature , that people are basically anti-social egoistic and er , aggressive , and that if left to themselves , life would be a war , war against all , is what we might call a pessimistic view of human nature . 
192514:162	###The , the importance of this , is that Freud is often said to have been a Hobbesian thinker , in the sense that , er without necessarily being directly influenced by Hobbes , he took a similar , a similar kind of view , or at least , so it is said . ###You could say , that er , a Hobbesian view of human nature , that people are basically anti-social egoistic and er , aggressive , and that if left to themselves , life would be a war , war against all , is what we might call a pessimistic view of human nature . 
192517:209	###This is why I call it a pessimistic theory . ###You 'll see why in a minute . 
192518:11	###You 'll see why in a minute . ###And I think you can see why I call it pessimistic because , basically it says in the Anglican prayer book , there is no good in us , what 's in us is , is bad , in the sense of anti- social egoistic , and if people are going to cooperate and if there 's gonna be social order , then as it were , it has to be imposed on them . 
192609:18	###They punished you when you did the wrong thing , and they rewarded you when , when , when they did , when you did the right thing . ###So the believing in religion with , with moral codes , particularly in those religions which have rather strict moral codes , and demand quite a lot from the believer , in terms of adherence to the er , to the moral law even those religions can be explained in terms of Freud 's transference theory , because that too , comes from childhood . 
192619:34	###Might the consequence of that be , that people then go out and murder and steal and rape and fight wars , and do all , do all these kinds anti-social things ? ###In other words , if you say , religion is an illusion , are you undermining and destroying social order ? 
192620:80	###In other words , if you say , religion is an illusion , are you undermining and destroying social order ? ###This is a this is a paradox that Freud has to face up to . 
192670:44	###So I think the , the statement Freud was a Hobbesian social thinker is just wrong . ###It 's factually wrong , or at least it 's factually wrong , if you were taking note of Freud 's writings after World War One . 
192670:87	###So I think the , the statement Freud was a Hobbesian social thinker is just wrong . ###It 's factually wrong , or at least it 's factually wrong , if you were taking note of Freud 's writings after World War One . 
192682:136	###But erm , that 's the idea , you see , that these kids , er well , you know , they may be delinquent , and do lots of nasty things , but it 's only the way they 've been treated by society . ###Basically , human nature is good . 
192700:52	###So that 's the , that 's the , there 's an optimistic view of , of , of the child . ###The pessimist , the Hobbesian thinkers , have a pessimistic view of the child . 
192703:43	###Certainly , I 'd never erm , forgiven er people for beatings I got at school . ###I mean there 's downright brutality , and , and , and deserved to be called nothing else . 
192704:70	###I mean there 's downright brutality , and , and , and deserved to be called nothing else . ###But anyway , the idea that the brutality is er justified , and you have to beat the hell out of little kids because er , if you do n't you wo n't civilize them . 
192704:82	###I mean there 's downright brutality , and , and , and deserved to be called nothing else . ###But anyway , the idea that the brutality is er justified , and you have to beat the hell out of little kids because er , if you do n't you wo n't civilize them . 
192718:95	###You 've only got to think of the career of erm , Audrey Hepburn who died today , or yesterday , whenever it was . ###Well , she 's a shining example of that . 
192753:22	###The realis the opt optimistic theories , on the other hand , also had their utopias , but they look forward . ###For the , for the optimists , the , the utopia is , is always in the , in the future , and these people er , tend to be revolutionaries . 
192759:35	###But they will experience those feelings , because human nature is not at either of these extreme points , it 's neither erm , perfectly good , nor perfectly bad , it 's a , it 's a mixture of both , and consequently , although you can improve the world , for it does n't deny you can improve the world , or make it worse , of course . ###To think that you could bring about a utopia , and perfect human nature in one way or another , is really a wildly er , optimistic and er , is in itself , er , some kind of illusion . 
192801:18	###There 's a growing body now , of people who are thinking along similar lines , and er , so it 's , it , it 's , I think you 'd be unwise to wipe this off just , just as my eccen eccentricity . ###I mean , it may be that . 
192826:88	###Well ###Well done , that was absolutely first rate , I mean erm , it was a difficult er , task you had , especially as the book was n't in the library , of which I am deeply apologetic , because I thought it was , and er , I thought you er , you coped with a very difficult assignment extremely well , and I think you can have an extra and I 'm sure everyone else thinks so too . 
192845:22	###I 'm not certain , I 'm not a great expert on it , but erm , the situation seems to be , that after the First World War , the central power was Germany and Austria , were defeated . ###Er , France , er was , er battle ravaged and its economy in ruins . 
192848:49	###So the United States was really the only world power erm , erm , as were able to do anything . ###In , in some ways , the situation you know , was a bit like , like what it is now , since the collapse of the Soviet Union , only more so , I would say , because the , the other powers were more , were even more prostrate than is , is , is the situation today . 
192909:110	###Erm , what 's worth reading about that , and it comes out strongly in the introduction , is that this is a kind of case stu study of a particular kind of person . ###Er , er , a man who grows up under the shadow of his father , as it were . 
192912:9	###The man who grows up idealizing his father , and whose relationship with his father is a largely passive one . ###So he tends to regard his father as a kind of ideal he can never equal , and tends if anything to identify with er , with his own mother , and play a kind of passive role to his , to his father . 
192945:102	###Like . ###So I er , I politely told him what he could do with that , well , I was eating his dinner and I could n't be too rude to him , but erm , you know , when er when , when confronted , I do n't give ground over that kind of thing . 
192949:12	###But erm , the people like and the left , did n't like the book either , because it did n't tell their particular interpretation , as kind of left Marxist er , interpretation as someone has it , was so popular at the time . ###And so the book was just kind of , ignored I think , and left standing , and now it 's out of print , and we 've discovered this week , it 's not even in the university library . 
192950:85	###And so the book was just kind of , ignored I think , and left standing , and now it 's out of print , and we 've discovered this week , it 's not even in the university library . ###Erm , it must have vanished , there was a copy there . 
192953:69	###There 's a whole area of psycho-history . ###Has anybody read about psycho-history ? 
192973:10	###What 's your interpretation , she would say , oh , we do n't know enough yet . ###She said I 'm not sure . 
192979:99	###Erm , it 's very difficult , of course , to er , well it 's impossible actually , to turn that into er written accounts . ###Because of course if you were to tape record analytic sessions , it would change that nature of the , of the analysis . 
193005:19	###But erm , the great pity of course is , that Freud did n't do this . ###It 's , I mean , Freud we know , did do a certain analysis . 
193035:23	###And this , for example , I mean , whether we believe this or not , this Freud says , or thinks , explains why Wilson could come to Europe as a saviour , the saviour of mankind , but then failed to deliver the goods , because of the passive nature of his identification , you know , Jesus got crucified . ###Which was a pretty passive thing to do , in some ways , erm , and similarly , you could say Woodrow Wilson ended up crucified by the , by the allies . 
193079:13	###No . ###No . 
193103:20	###Is anybody Jewish , by the way ? ###Right . 
193140:24	###Yes ###to make an appointment . 
193155:31	###I mean , you are in in the afternoon on Tuesday ? ###I might , yes . 
193220:26	###And she had a special name for it , I ca n't remember what is was now , but it was an innocuous word , like erm erm , kneading , or something like that , something you do with your fingers . ###Erm , and said , okay , that 's what you called it in childhood , you called , say kneading , if that 's what it was . 
193257:12	###It is a bit , is er is er is a bit odd . ###I suppose you liked it ? 
193311:12	###Yes . ###Yeah . 
193422:100	###Thank you Frank . ###I do n't know whether I 'm virtue or the reward , but never mind ! 
193454:155	###I 'm optimistic about nineteen ninety three . ###I ca n't of course foretell er what 's gonna happen in Eastern Europe , but looking externally er at the lower interest rates and the er more competitive value of the pound and internally at the improved cash flow and the actions that we 've been taking over for the past couple of years and I can say that there 's now generally a more optimistic feeling in the air amongst our group companies . 
193471:132	###Erm the Financial Times you showed er I think including the F T Group and Les Echo er in , in the profit analysis , but you did say that their operating profit was up ten percent th the F T Group which I take it to mean they made fourteen point three , leaving I think four point two to Les Echo You did also say that Les Echo had gone from strength to strength but f from my figures I think it 's a third successive decline in their profit . ###Would you like to , to explain what from strength to strength means or whether I 've got my figures wrong erm a and , and perhaps give an idea of what from strength to strength will mean in coming years ? 
193616:170	###Er , do you wanna add ? ###I was only gonna say we 're , we will probably have a much clearer idea by the time we get to the results . 
193628:7	###That 's all , so the the income was up , costs were costs were marginally down costs were down . ###reduction of the costs appears in ink . 
193639:23	###what average rate did you pay on it and what average rate are you paying this year ? ###Erm average net debt was down . 
193706:17	###But erm , we 're reasonably optimistic about visitor numbers . ###The concern in London particularly of course is the incidents of terrorist in of terrorist incidents , and that undoubtedly affected er visitation in London , not just at our places , but in most tourist attractions , particularly towards the end of last year . 
194922:20	###Those who were down there . ###have n't come prepared with , with any notes . 
194948:15	###Well he , he was ###Sounds like you 
194951:17	###And what he did was he wrote down quite a number of things . ###Oh yes ? 
195063:12	###I know a lot of us have done terms for a long term , but to be together closely and observe each other reacting and doing things it gives a better idea of how people think , being in this together . ###Yes . 
195074:9	###There was certainly a lot of pressure during the day ###Yes . 
195088:114	###I think we were a bit woolly really ###I think th the difficulty with that kind of day is that unless you 've decided what the outcome 's going to be before you start , you 're not actually going together are you ? 
195101:51	###That is what happens in sub-committees , is n't it ? ###We get down to the nitty-gritty there really . 
195118:26	###That 's not our parish ###That 's 
195139:104	###erm , and the direction of the parish council should be more in terms of defining strategy and so on . ###I 'm a bit worried at some of what is saying here erm , which seems to me like wanting to er create bureaucratic structure within a parish that , charts , positioning of everyone and they should know therefore , I just do n't think is , that 's my personal view , I do n't think it 's the right approach at all to a parish . 
195189:76	###I actually think we should n't take too much notice of the letter . ###I do n't 
195199:12	###Yes , there are some issues there , yes ###I think a point that comes over very much is the one about the structure and when I talk to people and listen to what they say , they 're still in the very traditional 
195201:13	###which I must say I certainly in that a parish council is it , and everybody else is linked in at lower levels . ###Now this is people 's traditional expectation and they still have it , whereas we 're of the mind that instead of this er you 've very cleverly got in this circle and the last day that I suddenly realized that we 're all equal and moving around in a reasonably organized manner but still we 're rather loose , whereas the traditional view is a parish councillor says it and everybody does the rest , with a few er renegades and revolutionaries at varying parts in your parish . 
195203:51	###Now , we have to get over to people this changed idea , and it has n't been got over because nobody that I 've listened to , or talked to , knows , in fact people say , what does the parish council do ? ###I never hear anything about them . 
195203:125	###Now , we have to get over to people this changed idea , and it has n't been got over because nobody that I 've listened to , or talked to , knows , in fact people say , what does the parish council do ? ###I never hear anything about them . 
195203:141	###Now , we have to get over to people this changed idea , and it has n't been got over because nobody that I 've listened to , or talked to , knows , in fact people say , what does the parish council do ? ###I never hear anything about them . 
195204:66	###I never hear anything about them . ###So , first of all , the method of dealing with things in such a changed manner has to be put over to people and I think the links , which were traditional , which no longer apply , have to be and it must be a link going out in directions like this . 
195206:145	###Now , you can have it by the written word and the spoken word , but I think the links we must continually have all the time are personal links , talking to people . ###It 's no good us saying oh well , nobody writes about that article , because a vast majority of people , that 's all they know about it , if they 've read that article at all , and not everybody reads the parish magazine . 
195222:46	###I thought that too . ###So I 'm always reaching down to people , and I do n't mean down as being inferior , reaching out to people is a better phrase , and I , I never give up about people wanting to partake . 
195235:60	###I think that is one of the problems . ###We are still feeling our way ourselves and 
195284:9	###It 's commonsense ###Yeah 
195323:12	###People are recognizing us ###you did touch earlier on about welcoming which is at the forefront of my mind all the time . 
195370:114	###But this part of the course that we 're specifically calling advocacy will concentrate on that part of the skill of advocacy , of the actual standing up and presenting information . ###Why do you need to know advocacy skills ? 
195416:80	###Dress is not going to be compulsory ###Well , dear , I suppose you really would make an impact then would n't you ? 
195416:95	###Dress is not going to be compulsory ###Well , dear , I suppose you really would make an impact then would n't you ? 
195453:112	###Be realistic about your client 's position . ###Do n't try to paint a picture of your client being the perfect citizen if he 's not the perfect citizen . 
195455:19	###The other thing to remember , you 're trying to persuade the court to your views , or the view that you 're putting forward for your client , you 're not telling the court what they must think . ###You 're putting over information on the basis that the only thing that a t an intelligent person think I 'm saying to you now , what 's going to be the effect of that on the listener ? 
195505:13	###This had entailed him working long hours . ###On the Friday before the incident occurred he had not got home until three o' clock in the morning . 
195521:103	###Madam may feel that having spent so much time in custody for the first offence that he has already suffered sufficient punishment , he 's been kept away from his girlfriend and children , and under those circumstances I would urge you Madam to take a lenient course of action , to make him the subject of a conditional discharge . ###Apart from anything else , that 'll ensure the court that he is not tempted to be involved in any similar incident in the future with is girlfriend . 
195523:47	###And Madam , I 'd also ask you to say that to to him to pay compensation for the minor injuries she 's suf she 's suffered and of course you have to consider that 's a point in a case involving assault , would be to add insult to injury , and would not assist the parties in coming to terms with their relationship and hopefully attempting a reconciliation . ###Right , so is a very experienced advocate . 
195685:37	###They get free travel . ###Er they do n't do so badly at all , they get free er They get allowance for their accommodation in London , Okay ?

195895:33	###I mean I payed it obviously because you If you live you live in er you live in the land you 've got to pl go by the law . ###Exactly and if you do n't pay it , and there are a few silly old so and sos not paying it at the moment , I mean the rest of us have had to pa 
195918:30	###the devil . ###Er no . 
195921:30	###Yes . ###Well that 's it . 
195928:64	###Yeah . ###Er and then they 'll be saying how can you afford to go to Blackpool ? 
195985:30	###You do n't ? ###No . 
196097:94	###I really do I wish to have an M P here on the phone line and talk about this er proposed pay rise . ###They cannot do this again without expecting us to cause trouble . 
196108:47	###No . ###I mean they wo n't you see . 
196115:91	###Of course they are . ###Now some people may say that thirty one thousand pounds is n't a great deal of money . 
196154:83	###Right , thank you . ###Okay res that 's the Yeah ring that number , that 's the number to ring . 
196162:11	###And I 've just found your microphone as well , which is quite ###Mhm .

196367:35	###In the Sport ? ###In the Jacuzzi with the girls I 'm your man 
196392:7	###I 'm very well too . ###My sympathies . 
196394:7	###It must ###so like my husband and I would like all the listeners to know 
196412:27	###The life insurance would be wonderful . ###It would would it ? 
196653:14	###Oh . ###Unlikely indeed . 
196723:23	###Erm and the simple reason he says the the historical length of time taken by females we need more public facilities . ###Also to make them more user friendly especially for mums with toddlers in tow , they need to be more roomy . 
196780:7	###All right here we go . ###Er right I 'll just leave you there for a moment and put that back up there . 
196780:48	###All right here we go . ###Er right I 'll just leave you there for a moment and put that back up there . 
196941:32	###And then you get into the situations apparently where erm people decide after they 've had sex ###Mm . 
196958:33	###So er as soon as the girl turns to you and says , Right I do n't want to go any further that 's it . ###Well it 's it 's annoying at that point . 
196959:12	###Well it 's it 's annoying at that point . ###It 's very annoying but that 's when you have to stop . 
196975:34	###Funnily enough though there are there are feminist women who are who are saying similar things that saying that it is a bit irresponsible to have gotten into bed with someone and taken all your clothes off and then say no . ###Yeah but 
196982:9	###We can be persuasive ###Mm . 
196983:7	###Mm . ###but there has to be a time when no is no . 
197014:10	###You are ? ###Yep . 
197095:10	###I 've been listening to your programme all morning so . ###I see . 
197105:16	###He then told the court I had better not say she was an angel or no angel or the national press will have a hundred field days . ###She was a girl trying to find young men to satisfy her sexual desires . 
197194:28	###Hey hey I say all these kids are doing is walking round with a bloody turnip with a candle in it . ###They 're not learning about religion where they do n't believe in blood transfusions etcetera etcetera seven or eight year old . 
197196:7	###Yes but I think you know you have to give ###Go on . 
197274:26	###Mm . ###in the past , make remarks which I regret . 
197279:40	###Mm . ###problem as to what to do about it . 
197307:75	###That 's worrying . ###I do n't want to appear in front a judge in his first five years then . 
197456:91	###Well , er , I think that both governments have said er in their , and both Prime Ministers , er and I 'm glad they met , er that the ###That 's Mr Reynolds , I assume . 
197457:18	###That 's Mr Reynolds , I assume . ###Yes that they are beginning a process involving both governments and er naturally er I welcome that very much , because I think the attention of both governments would have to be concentrated on this terrible problem , and of course if they take the trouble to read the statement that Mr Addams and I issued that 's precisely what we said , that the two governments should begin a process involving all parties . 
197463:46	###Sorry , I know you do n't understand , and you 're not going to understand on this program . ###Why not ? 
197466:33	###But does the Government ? ###Sorry . 
197479:175	###Yes , he has said that and I am saying , I am saying , as somebody who has been in the front line against this violence , and with due respect to Mr Major knows a little more about it than he does ###So Mr Majors wrong ? 
197490:176	###Well , what , why ? ###Albert Reynolds has told the Prime Minister , Mr Major , Mr Major has taken on board , has has considered , presumably , what it is that you 've done with Gerry Adams , and concluded that it can go no further . 
197548:161	###It was passengers who were supposed to benefit from Lord Paignton 's amendment , the rebels think they 've safeguarded the spirit of that vote , but experts disagree . ###The amendment the Government has put forward does not hold out much real hope for B R managers about remaining in the medium or long term in charge of viable business , to that extent the amendment does not carry out what I believe was the intention of Lord Paignton in in moving the amendment . 
197570:45	###they will then they will , they 've just started actually ###But they 've finished one . 
197675:31	###I , I ###on this restructuring group it 's British Rail , it 's the Treasury , it 's the Department of Transport , it 's the franchise director . 
197717:217	###No , I think that we would have liked to have seen more women , I would have liked to have stayed on the Shadow Cabinet , and I would have liked to have seen more women in the Shadow Cabinet , but to say it 's a disaster , and somehow we 've moved away from the path we 've set ourself is simply not the case . ###Alright , let me substitute setback , for disaster then , how about that ? 
197723:82	###Well I think that it is possible that as a result of the reporting of the Shadow Cabinet elections , that the sense was out in the public that somehow this was a setback for women , and that Labour ###It was , was n't it ? 
197744:17	###and ###the real politics of it is that those labels are attached , and you know that as well as I do . 
197752:44	###So that 's it , that 's , so that 's it then for the modernization of the Party 's constitution , we we what happened at Brighton was the end of the process was it ? ###What we 've got now is what we 're going to have in another ten years time ? 
197776:63	###A phrase from the Conservative 's manifesto last year , we are the only party that understands the need for low taxation , has now returned to haunt them , for an M P in a marginal constituency this evokes the electoral ghost of George Bush , so he firmly rules out increases in income tax , but would n't mind putting V A T on newspapers and books . ###But would it be within the spirit of the manifesto to murmur , read my lips , no more direct taxes ? 
197829:83	###I do n't think anybody knows exactly how they 'd react to that you know sort of And I think the women 's support group has created the frame work that 's enabled us . ###Because it was the women themselves who were organizing it because they felt part of it they did n't see it as some sort of other people that were more politically motivated that than them giving them something to keep them out on strike , which by its very nature could could have been something that the people would have accepted for a while and then not accepted . 
197832:72	###I mean if you think about it it was just an impossible task to do it sort of fairly or so that everybody felt all right about it and also that you know if it 's your own children you 're having to choose presents you know the who whole idea was sort of very very difficult really . ###And I think it was an example of the trust that we 'd built up over the weeks and months that we were able to do it . 
197839:69	###And er she wanted er you know she has visions of us filling the streets of from to with banners waving and the we asked for no banners in the first rally we had back in October because we did n't want it to be seen as some thing that had you know big sort of take over and everybody you know the Communist Party and the language people and er all the different factions being able to wave their banners you know , We support the Blaenau quarry men . ###And er but very definitely now I think we 've got the self confidence that er you know we very much and er we feel established enough that everybody can bring their banners and it 's gonna be a good day . 
197856:46	###Yes . ###Yes . 
197877:125	###Well yes it 's it I dunno it 's you know I do n't know want to say You know basically the facilities for change are really in the hands of of the politicians are n't they you know ? ###And I think that 's that 's a wonderful experience to realize that er you can be part of you know cos surely finally working men and women through history have never without sticking together they 'd they 'd still be back you know in the in the dark ages as far you know . 
197881:15	###And erm . ###But I mean I think the feeling of the the miners were out for a year I mean time and time again I 've heard people say , Oh how d how do they do it and look at the money they 're sending us and look at what they 're doing for us and how ho . 
197900:45	###And in a way it 's become easier as the times this might sound funny as the times gone on . ###Almost as if we can go on forever if that 's how it 's got to be . 
197901:40	###Almost as if we can go on forever if that 's how it 's got to be . ###You know it 's a sort of what 's got to be has got to be in a sense I mean there 's no going back now there 's no surely finally every every strike is settled in the end and they 've got to come and talk . 
197904:39	###We first of all we used to give the food parcel every fortnight because it was half one week and half the next and now it 's a food parcel every week so they they 're guaranteed that basic sustenance you know and erm and we 'll keep up the up th up the fund raising and the money 's certainly still pouring in . ###I mean th the f the funds having dropped at all . 
197913:89	###So I mean and if a and surely if they 're talking about actual support in terms of food and money I mean can they really . ###You know in a way South Wales is paying back the debt that we pa w w we paid them in their strike you know I mean and That 's communities helping communities and if really this management is talking about er the fact that they resent families not having to go without over Christmas and this sort of thing you know I mean where are their values you know it 's difficult to understand is n't it ? 
197924:39	###Well this came up actually on a on a radio sho er chat thing that was open to the public in Blaenau Ffestiniog last night er where the chair was saying erm well you know I mean a lot of the a lot of the people that have n't been very involved in this strike that I think should have been involved . ###I mean myself as a councillor I think i if you 're a councillor you should be involved in the strike in one way or another you know . 
197928:75	###Er we 've all got to be friends in a situation let bygones be bygones sort of . ###Well I mean it 's gone much beyond that I mean they the reality of the situation is er is not like that I 'm afraid I mean it Eighteen men have been sacked and and these are men that have put those quarries where they are . 
197954:114	###D the people who 've erm re who 've really helped you in in ver very substantial way do you go and see them ? ###Yeah well we 're in touch with each another you know qu quite a lot of people have visited us . 
197979:65	###So erm I mean I think we 're definitely seen by the men as as the more as the more brave in in a way you know . ###D' ya do you think they 've erm re really learnt anything from you ? 
198024:29	###If you had 've been asked , would you for what he actually bought ? ###Certainly the saw he bought for the mill I think that has great prospects and you know there 's no two ways about it , it could help production and ease the work of the workforce . 
198024:52	###If you had 've been asked , would you for what he actually bought ? ###Certainly the saw he bought for the mill I think that has great prospects and you know there 's no two ways about it , it could help production and ease the work of the workforce . 
198058:16	###Erm , we called a lodge meeting before the annual leave , annual shutdown , and in that lodge meeting all three quarries agreed to go on a work to rule as from the resumption of work , which is second week of August . ###I ca n't remember in fact if there was a Transport official there . 
198167:18	###Was his er presence would you interpret his his presence as being fair fairly crucial for the continuing of the strike ? ###Whichever way I answer this erm it 's gonna be . 
198297:7	###Now er we 're going to start this morning talking about animals . ###More specifically why we 're so cruel to them . 
198299:85	###Britain must be an animal erm a country of animal abusers looking at the statistics . ###Why do we hate animals so much ? 
198307:23	###But they are willing quite willing apparently to give and receive pets as presents and millions of them end up getting abused neglected and destroyed . ###Every year we see that doleful little puppy on the television screen and every year thousands of people give pets for Christmas . 
198346:130	###Yes . ###And it goes on and on like this until the voice is erm , I ca n't feel anything any more . 
198426:30	###The United States er government is afraid as are other governments to admit er to their people that there is a higher form of life . ###Obviously if the U F Os touch down that would mean they would be charge and not Bill Clinton at the White House . 
198529:71	###Ha ha . ###Oh that was slick . 
198529:108	###Ha ha . ###Oh that was slick . 
198531:81	###Okay now er Garth Brookes my favourite country singer at the moment and er your chance to win this Elvis video okay you have to ring in we 're giving this away first you have to ring in and tell me and tell me the next word no I ca n't do that I ca n't no I ca n't do it 's too easy okay . ###All right tell me er complete the sentence of this of this particular hit song that Elvis er had and it 's difficult all right . 
198546:65	###What are you on here for ? ###Because er because I was invited on to speak about current educational issues 
198577:54	###Why ? ###I mean why why are our children going to school in in pig sties ? 
198615:41	###We we well we 'd love to be able to get get on with our job and er wi with far less interference than we receive at the moment but er when government insists on er on interfering to the extent it does an and there have been well I 've been reading recently so something like five hundred new powers the Education Secretary has given himself in the in over the last last few years . ###Well he 's not going to be there for ever . 
198618:58	###If they affect education then it 's our responsibility to speak up about them . ###You see I I think er er probably one of the best erm Ministers of er of er Education that er has been for quite some considerable time and I bet you throw your hands up in horror when I say this you will totally disagree and I 'm talking here cos his name 's just slipped out of my mind . 
198670:90	###Well that 's what everybody sings to me when them and they meet me for the first time or get introduced to me . ###Oh they do n't . 
198691:10	###Jolly well ought to as well . ###Er I wanted to talk to Jim Bowen you see about this quiz show host ought to be a a little nicer than they are and apparently his answer machine is on at home .

200292:12	###And you take it . ###As well . 
200297:63	###You 've taken it ? ###That 's fine . 
200365:18	###Now . ###Well er y it 's you cannot solve it by a security policy alone . 
200472:27	###The Republican Movement has general orders which apply to everyone within that movement . ###That movement is a mixture of Sinn Fein which is the political dimension to the struggle and the I R A . 
200477:36	###What I will say is that Gerry Addams is a member of the Republican Movement . ###You can judge for yourself . 
200479:10	###Is the Republican Movement the I R A , I would have to say logically of course it 's the I R A . ###Would Gerry Addams be like a large company , a director of that of an organization , a large company ? 
200492:14	###You 'd only just multiply the thing , you 'd spill petrol on an already burning flame . ###And the situation 's very tense at the moment anyway and it would just 
200549:12	###I mean the army was left to do a job which politicians should have done . ###And the army opted for internment . 
200549:28	###I mean the army was left to do a job which politicians should have done . ###And the army opted for internment . 
200551:12	###And really it has to be said and has to be said historically that I mean the army in a way was left with a job which politicians should have sorted out before it got to that stage . ###We 're gonna to speak to some army people Martin . 
200556:59	###thing today to suggest that there is a security solution . ###It presupposes that the intelligence people have the information now , hold on the 
200615:9	###Are we talking about a normal liberal democracy ? ###The fact that some members of that democracy , some individuals , flight its rules , does n't mean that those , the vast majority , the ninety nine point nine per cent of us , follow their example . 
200706:105	###Surely the logic in that is that we sh we should sit down ###the British government should sit down with Gerry Addams . 
200837:10	###I was actually er answering your friend 's comments there , but he spoke over you so I wanted to answer him back . ###Oh that 's okay .

201089:39	###Did you find at school that your dialect was hammered ? ###Yes . 
201308:11	###Or did do mind you I I would n't think it now not for younger folk that 's not the case but for the older folk it very much worse . ###Do you think they 're being slapped down over dialect ? 
201319:36	###That was quite good . ###But you see there was always this thought that it was always to better yourself that you were doing this that your Orcadian was just for home about and among yourselves and what it did n't really matter . 
201345:84	###The pier and the hydro and the telephone made a big difference to it . ###But erm other eighteen inches or two foot to a jetty to land it .

201458:9	###Oh it took some sorting out on the next morning . ###And you see all the crop had vanished over the night . 
201459:11	###And you see all the crop had vanished over the night . ###And they had to import hay and straw and goodness knows what . 
201474:32	###Cos if the steamer only came once a week that would n't have been enough . ###Oh that was about the lot er we had . 
201476:80	###If you wanted to go to Kirkwall you had to cross to the Rousay pier and then either hire a car or walk to and get across with Tom . ###Erm that was in the early days Charley and Tom did the crossing there for the mails and early in nineteen fifty one no fifty five that we took over the mails . 
201490:7	###You said you met the Wyre post boat coming back so you did n't ###As we went back to Wyre home to Wyre we could meet the Wyre post boat coming across for the mails that we put to Rousay . 
201499:7	###Oh no no no . ###Well we went every day on about the mail so it was a passenger service that really started off in nineteen fifty five but we bought maybe in nineteen fifty three or fifty four . 
201523:7	###Things would n't have kept what you would have had a totally different kind of eating habits ? ###Well I suppose more salted meat I mean more home home butching and erm making bread I suppose or the womenfolk were likely baking every day .

201588:15	###They started pecking one another and it was a job to get them stopped . ###Yes it 's funny to think of hens having feelings but I suppose being cooped up like that it did affect them .

203420:35	###I ca n't explain the reasons why . ###Our our figures we maintain are the correct ones . 
203465:28	###The source is important and er how you deal with the source . ###Er I mentioned that we have made an allowance for students in this migration .

203610:86	###They do n't even enter into the projections we have done at all . ###Because they 're a constant number , it does n't arise . 
203674:26	###Similarly , I have also circulated a table entitled environmental capacity , where I have looked at what is the difference in percentage land-take terms , between the proposals of the county council and the proposals of the federation . ###We can see from that table that even on unconstrained land , we are talking about a difference of point one nine percent of land take . 
203752:18	###Er m more of a natural change . ###I I I Roy , House Builders Federation . 
203800:68	###Erm I think it is one of the important that should be emphasized . ###I think as Mr did say , erm the issue of affordable housing is a very real one . 
203863:12	###Headship . ###Erm they 're obtained by looking at the results of the labour force survey which is a very small proportion of households surveyed each year . 
203896:15	###Erm in my view the Secretary of State may come to the view on the latest figures that are available for him and erm No that is what I hope he will do when it comes to erm producing regional guidance . ###Thank you . 
203951:32	###Can I short circuit that question and say , what in fact is your hundred percent ? ###Erm Roy , House Builders Federation . 
203967:12	###That 's a for your calculations ###Mhm . 
203967:50	###That 's a for your calculations ###Mhm . 
204024:89	###Quite clearly there there is recognition that there should be some limit to the level of migration er inward migration in North Yorkshire . ###And the Secreta the Secretary of State is quite clear that the environmental constraint in North Yorkshire , is a particularly important one . 
204025:27	###And the Secreta the Secretary of State is quite clear that the environmental constraint in North Yorkshire , is a particularly important one . ###Although we might try to decision method , the overall stress of the Secretary of State 's decision methods , as they affect North Yorkshire , is that there must be some limit er to migration largely for environmental considerations and indeed , the panel in nineteen eighty seven were very concerned that er migration would not be slowed quickly enough er in North Yorkshire . 
204102:7	###That does n't form part of this alteration , there is no such justification and that 's our particular objection to it . ###In so far as a three year average is concerned , point b made by Mr and erm that being taken into account the tail end of the boom . 
204114:38	###Indeed P P G one paragraph four , talks about guiding development to the right places . ###As well as preventing development which is not acceptable . 
204133:26	###The term , long term strategy in fact appears in a number of instances erm throughout those pages . ###And I 'd refer you to paragraph three ten and also paragraph four two two which I 'd like to quote a short erm element from . 
204133:32	###The term , long term strategy in fact appears in a number of instances erm throughout those pages . ###And I 'd refer you to paragraph three ten and also paragraph four two two which I 'd like to quote a short erm element from . 
204161:42	###If they were n't there , those houses , I suspect a large proportion of those people would now be living in North Yorkshire . ###So there 's a requirement of complementary policies . 
204168:15	###We 're now thirteen years further on . ###I think whilst the Secretary of State has clearly said what he 's said in that decision letter . 
204188:39	###I 'll repeat the point . ###I 'm not saying that P P G twelve does not apply . 
204189:7	###I 'm not saying that P P G twelve does not apply . ###But I 'm making the point , it does apply but it has to be justified . 
204271:17	###This is the sort of thing we want to discuss as we go through each of the areas which we shall do under matter one C . ###Or one C . 
204302:25	###Mr , you want to come back on that . ###Er Richard , . 
204305:9	###It 's quite clear in in P P G three , paragraph eleven , that structure plans will make clear whether the housing provision figures include allowance from expected supply from conversions and changes of use , as well as from new building . ###And for unidentified and for losses from demolitions . 
204327:10	###Erm they estimated there was going to be a continued out migration , but the aim of the original West Yorkshire structure plan and the p erm strategic guidance was to contain rather more of the population . ###Regional planning guidance will go to two thousand and six . 
204386:11	###chairman shall I put my head on head on the block . ###Margaret , Department of the Environment . 
204388:63	###Erm I have to say that that these are largely my personal views of the member of the regional office , rather than obviously the Secretary of State at this stage in the proceedings . ###But I think if you went for the figure as proposed by the H B F , you would be going actively against the regeneration statutory which is the erm the government 's policy . 
204404:14	###That 's right , our position is that we 've already erm adversely affected our environment if you like as and the balanced er approach respectively needs to meet housing requirements . ###Erm but we 've gone as far as we feel we need to . 
204432:46	###And by implication , the thirty nine thousand figure . ###Erm certainly the low figure would cause us tremendous problems er environmental problems of our own . 
204435:18	###Erm the higher figure would obviously lead to bring into question something that er Miss has mentioned about er urban regeneration . ###Erm I think erm both the low and the high figures would cause us problems , and that is why we have have accepted the County Council 's figures based on continuation of past trends , migration trends , which as my colleague from Leeds has pointed out earlier we are obliged to do and are continuing to do in following from R P G two in our depopulation of the . 
204442:7	###However erm one thing I think that 's got to be borne in mind and it picks up a point that erm Leeds have made , is that they 're looking towards trendy migration , they say . ###With their balance of things . 
204462:52	###So we are assuming a little bit more Bradford and Leeds but not erm la particularly large amounts . ###Do you do you want to comment on the lowest figure ? 
204503:33	###And the ma market will become targeted to particular sectors and particular groups . ###And one effect of the recession has been , I 've got to say , that a lot of the old that er house-builders have operated on , which are good for selling , which sites will sell well , etcetera a lot of those rules have been out of the window . 
204532:67	###It seems to me unavoidable that one of the consequences would be to take more greenbelt land in West Yorkshire . ###And in that sense the choice at this E I P is whether to use greenbelt in West Yorkshire , or non-greenbelt in North Yorkshire . 
204580:14	###Unless of course it 's er high rise housing housing in in in urban areas and of course in that in those scenarios you do get a big reductions in the number of . ###pitched at twenty one thousand , could . 
204605:21	###We 've heard in introduction Mr Mr say that the County Council would not like to see housing requirements any lower than they have proposed . ###I take I take that to be that that is the bottom end of a of a range . 
204636:55	###Erm there are other policies in any event which one can use at local and structure plan level to secure social housing provision if it 's required . ###But I would also like to pick up the point that Mr said , there is no evidence to suggest there 's a massive problem of the local residents of North Yorkshire er not being able to compete with people in other counties to the North and to the West . 
204645:211	###I 'm being provocative . ###Mr , is that not the case . 
204684:12	###Then you it 'll be extremely difficult ###The the the County Council 
204714:65	###But if Mr ' s argument is that windfalls and recycled land are as it were free of any environmental penalties and can be added to his thirty one thousand , then I think that er the way to treat that is to come to a higher number which takes them properly into account . ###Mr ? 
204824:30	###And there will be a shortfall of that amount . ###Obviously some supply would would occur because housing associations will build wholly on some sites . 
204837:25	###We 've exhaustively surveyed Leeds time and again to find these erm so called brown field sites which our own residents suggest are there . ###And there just there are just not enough in suitable locations for housing , to meet the needs of Leeds . 
204911:12	###Erm ###Those are those are new build dwellings ? 
204912:13	###Those are those are new build dwellings ? ###Right I 'll have to check back against all the figures , if you can just give me a moment . 
204984:31	###Well it gives a schedule of housing conditions in Greater York erm and I 've been comparing in in turn that schedule with the schedule produced by the City Council on a more updated basis . ###And that actually gives an assumption of net conversion gains in the Greater York area . 
204996:85	###It does not require that they specifically be separated out . ###And I 'm not quite sure if that would necessarily assist the district councils in the preparation of their district plans . 
204996:123	###It does not require that they specifically be separated out . ###And I 'm not quite sure if that would necessarily assist the district councils in the preparation of their district plans . 
204997:24	###And I 'm not quite sure if that would necessarily assist the district councils in the preparation of their district plans . ###But if if if if you are saying that calculation of housing provision includes conversions , I 'm somewhat some guidance on how much provision will have to made from new built sites , and somebody 's going to have to make an intelligent assumption about how much is coming forward from conversions . 
204998:24	###But if if if if you are saying that calculation of housing provision includes conversions , I 'm somewhat some guidance on how much provision will have to made from new built sites , and somebody 's going to have to make an intelligent assumption about how much is coming forward from conversions . ###Well certainly the starting point for that must be to look at what has been happening in the past as evidence . 
205002:32	###The districts obviously will do their assessments through the local plan . ###Well absolutely I mean this is the way that things have always worked and the County Council makes a global assessment of requirements for a particular district and the district council then takes it forward with assumptions on small sites , windfall sites er and major allocations that they may be mad making . 
205003:54	###Well absolutely I mean this is the way that things have always worked and the County Council makes a global assessment of requirements for a particular district and the district council then takes it forward with assumptions on small sites , windfall sites er and major allocations that they may be mad making . ###Er conversions are simply a different factor they will have to take into account . 
205054:14	###On the basis that a lot of the big houses that were doing holiday accommodation and so on , er have have already been converted and this is our experience , so on that basis we have taken a reduced figure for conversions and that is basically the reasoning behind it . ###Now er thereafter you say well why six ninety and not seven ten . 
205054:23	###On the basis that a lot of the big houses that were doing holiday accommodation and so on , er have have already been converted and this is our experience , so on that basis we have taken a reduced figure for conversions and that is basically the reasoning behind it . ###Now er thereafter you say well why six ninety and not seven ten . 
205065:31	###I mentioned in in my first contribution this morning a a concern about that those considerations that environmental considerations , even if they have been fully considered er are not there 's not an explanation provided anywhere in in the structure plan supporting material as to how that 's actually been achieved . ###However there there is there is I think some re there are relevant sections in in the county council document N Y eleven , which follows on which is the the county 's as I understand it rebuttal to to the H B F 's assumptions on erm the environmental constraints and how they should apply across the county . 
205157:75	###But before we do that , er and you 're having given to you a piece of paper , headed possible scenarios for panel reporting on the new settlement . ###Erm a very minor point , when you get it , those who have got it already , would you just draw a line from the top line which says discussed criteria , down to the box which says evaluate sectors around York etcetera . 
205160:82	###Erm as we see it , there are en two possible courses on the new settlement that in fact you end up if you look at the right hand side of that sheet of paper , with four possible answers . ###But if I start with A . 
205162:171	###If if it is considered that a new settlement is required to meet the housing provision in Greater York , then the first question that has to be asked is , is the criteria approach alone acceptable . ###If the answer to that is yes , then we proceed to discuss the criteria and the panel could proceed to report accordingly on those . 
205199:98	###There have also been several representations from those sitting on my left hand side , about the possible answers to question one D in the affirmative . ###All that evidence is before the panel , we have a duty to report upon it . 
205209:12	###Mr ? ###Richard of . 
205216:109	###It would be for them to decide what to do with our report . ###And of course it is open to them to take a contrary view to any conclusion reached on any matter by the panel . 
205223:9	###I was a little surprised to hear yesterday the views of Mr about the need for this plan to identify the location or the general location of the new settlement . ###Er that is not a consistent theme within the D O E strategy . 
205239:40	###we concede on the basis of the exercises that have been discussed so far , I think you will find it very difficult to make a firm recommendation in favour of a specific location. , albeit on a district basis . ###I think you 'll find it very difficult to do . 
205239:179	###we concede on the basis of the exercises that have been discussed so far , I think you will find it very difficult to make a firm recommendation in favour of a specific location. , albeit on a district basis . ###I think you 'll find it very difficult to do . 
205241:49	###And maybe at the end of the day , the County Council will have to come to a conclusion , after you 've made your general recommendations , with or without a location maybe th they will decide that having gone through a consultation exercise , they 're only course is to modify the proposals which would then have to be the subject of another E I P . ###Now I hope that does n't r ring alarm bells . 
205271:40	###Cos it it would mean the decision would be taken by the Secretary of State and not by the local authorities . ###Alternatively , the step by step approach urged by Mr , appears to be totally illogical . 
205278:15	###I I take your point that yes you have submitted er a a proposal as have other parties er to the discussion . ###From our point of view we 're not in the position and it would be totally wrong of us actually to try in public to to deal with those or to come to a specific conclusion about any particular proposal . 
205332:82	###Erm can I throw another spanner in the works er sir . ###Cos what we have heard so far this morning is certainly placing me in all of the local authority . 
205393:95	###First of all is criteria , criterion . ###One that the new settlement should avoid er the greenbelt . 
205414:14	###I think it 's very unlikely but I think it described as one avoid the greenbelt , to be seen to be er encompassing all possibilities . ###Yeah . 
205415:87	###Yeah . ###Sorry I I have to cut across my advice to everybody else there . 
205503:67	###Accordingly , the guidance given in P P G paragraph three should be followed by including the word normally in the policy requirement and the requirement for the new settlement to be beyond the outer edge of the York greenbelt so as to avoid the greenbelt , with then form part of the locational criteria one . ###This will also make H two consistent with the existing greenbelt development control policies E nine and E ten of the approved county structure plan which are still being retained and also the proposed open countryside policy E E two , all of which use the qualification , normally . 
205531:29	###Now I also agree that these criteria are not of equal importance and I certainly would put the greatest weight on criterion one which is to avoid the greenbelt in fact I think it 's so important that it should n't be a criterion but it should be actually be within the preamble as it is now . ###So that it 's not a matter which is weight to balance . 
205531:54	###Now I also agree that these criteria are not of equal importance and I certainly would put the greatest weight on criterion one which is to avoid the greenbelt in fact I think it 's so important that it should n't be a criterion but it should be actually be within the preamble as it is now . ###So that it 's not a matter which is weight to balance . 
205535:46	###And that again is emphasised by P P three and it goes back to the erm the o the object of sustainability and reducing C O two emissions . ###The the third and I think very important criterion is the need to avoid is the need to comply with sub-regional planning objectives . 
205546:50	###Mr and Mr have er laid great stress on the issue of sub-regional guidance erm and the implication that they would be happy with a new settlement location shall we say in the south west erm of the of the Greater York er area . ###Now it may well be that er that may well be the the position in the south west in in respect of of of that particular criteria , but we would need to see , er how a location in that area , met the other eleven criteria . 
205548:63	###And even looking at that one , erm erm the south west location , one would have to say that the increased accessibility erm which will shortly be afforded by the dualling of the northern section erm of the York outer relief road , er would increase the accessibility of areas to the north east of erm er of Greater York er to West Yorkshire . ###And I think that quite clearly proves that what you need to do is a detailed evaluation of all these criteria , all of them which reflect as a appropriate strategic guidance , to come er er to a balanced view . 
205548:87	###And even looking at that one , erm erm the south west location , one would have to say that the increased accessibility erm which will shortly be afforded by the dualling of the northern section erm of the York outer relief road , er would increase the accessibility of areas to the north east of erm er of Greater York er to West Yorkshire . ###And I think that quite clearly proves that what you need to do is a detailed evaluation of all these criteria , all of them which reflect as a appropriate strategic guidance , to come er er to a balanced view . 
205599:33	###Yes . ###Almost a double negative is n't it . 
205648:30	###Erm erm in respect of the West Yorkshire greenbelt . ###And strict interpretation of the ten miles and Mr reminded me would just pinch in a little bit erm of the of the West Yorkshire greenbelt . 
205706:97	###Michael . ###I think that two and a eleven basically say the same thing in different in different ways . 
205727:39	###On the particular issue of regional migration as it affects Greater York , I would suspect and we can probably put some information in to confirm this that the linkages between Greater York area and other county areas within er Yorkshire and Humberside , vary . ###I I I say probably quite definitely that there is not a great linkage between the Greater York area in numeric terms and and all of Humberside , compared to that linkage erm with with with West Yorkshire . 
205730:10	###Er well Mr first Mr , please . ###Yes er Gerald , . 
205732:71	###I I have to disagree with er Mr of , I think this criterion is crucially important and in fact what Peter has just said , reemphasises my view that er the important sub-regional and regional issue is the relationship between York and Leeds in this er under this criterion . ###And I 'd just like to take the opportunity to er emphasise the point that I have been making at this E I P that erm r regional migration from the West Yorkshire is reducing and we do n't want to create a magnet which reverses that trend . 
205745:139	###Now that issue , needs to be borne in mind . ###Er in the in in the overall evaluation . 
205759:12	###Thank you . ###Mr ? 
205760:7	###Mr ? ###Erm I have to concur with that but nevertheless , er the north east sector is further away from Leeds than the south west sector of York . 
205787:15	###Thank you sir . ###Paul , planning partnership . 
205806:18	###The the memo I 've got is that the new settlement provision according to the structure plan , relates to the the Greater York area . ###Yes . 
205815:64	###Well erm the Greater York study area has been defined and it is that area erm on the front of the erm of the Greater York er study document . ###That is the area which has been used for the last five or six years as the basis of the And that outer boundary more or less coincides with the outer boundary erm of the York greenbelt . 
205843:12	###it is for this reason firstly to identify the gree er the Greater York area as considered by the Secretary of State , and also to with regard to criterion three , er the question of consistency with agreed agreed approved greenbelt policy that I make this further comment . ###Thank you . 
205934:46	###Just just er just so I can be absolutely sure about that I think I 'm say I 'm asking the same thing that the senior inspector 's just asked . ###The commitments data that we 've been dealing with to date , for the Greater York area , that was supplied by the County Council , was that data that applied to the what we 're now calling the the the the greenbelt area , or was it the area of search as well ? 
205961:34	###I also take the point Mr has made , and only assure you that we will look at these figures when we get them and take on board the sorts of comments that have just been made by yourself and Mr and by and use them with our judgement applied liberally . ###Peter , North Yorkshire . 
205986:20	###Peter , North Yorkshire , chairman . ###Just to comment on the senior inspector 's first point . 
205990:56	###The bypass for example allowing people to move round er Greater York without passing through the er through the city centre and I think that 's par part of the County Council and I suspect City Council 's overall approach to traffic management in Greater York . ###Michael Michael . 
205990:88	###The bypass for example allowing people to move round er Greater York without passing through the er through the city centre and I think that 's par part of the County Council and I suspect City Council 's overall approach to traffic management in Greater York . ###Michael Michael . 
206004:22	###I 'm sorry , if I could just make on other point . ###You raised this question of whether or not I think the new settlement should link into the primary net road network . 
206063:16	###A very quick point sir . ###Erm I I would have thought it would be helpful that if criterion four could be worded in such a way that it it emphasised the need to maximize transport choice . 
206071:49	###Somewhere near the top of the list ? ###Michael . 
206132:61	###I appreciate you 're trying to get on . ###Mr , if we have a criterion that says protect the countryside for its own sake , and a criterion from our discussion yesterday , and somewhere down here in relation to free standing , is n't our conclusion that nowhere is acceptable for a new settlement . 
206139:92	###Yes ###that Selby is unconstrained in inverted commas . 
206165:9	###And then include schemes widely distributed throughout Greater York . ###The difference is in the proportion and type of best and most versatile . 
206283:89	###You anticipate me sir . ###Erm yes you you you 'll know from my evidence that I have certain reservations about the detailed wording of this of this particular criteria . 
206304:26	###What what we have n't yet defined is is what we mean by self containment . ###And and the degree to which that is consistent with the sustainable development argument that has been already been put . 
206361:21	###So that that the constraint would n't apply in in those areas anyway . ###Er at the very least I wish to see the criteria amended erm and expressed in terms of minimizing impact rather er avoiding completely . 
206375:32	###Now that does not entirely rule out any possibility of the new settlement within the Selby area , as er Mr has implied . ###That has never been the County Council 's interpretation of the of the relationship between er this criteria and the Selby coalfield . 
206423:69	###If the new if the new settlement proves successful , it will have an impetus all its own and therefore it will not come to a full stop in two thousand and six . ###There will be a natural tendency for expansion to occur thereafter . 
206425:80	###Therefore in considering the degree to which any er area can assimilate a new settlement , the size which it must reach subsequent to two thousand and six , should be considered in addition to the size it expected to reach by that date . ###A valid point Mr , yes . 
206468:10	###Can I remind you that we 'll be looking at er two D on Tue Tuesday morning . ###That 'll be starting at ten o' clock . 
206471:81	###Erm if we overrun on Tuesday morning , then we have spare time in our programme for a week day . ###Erm I just put you on notice about that . 
206482:89	###Thank you The the the good news for you the good news for you is that if we erm run out of time on Tuesday morning , we can have the hall all night , Tuesday night . ###Thank you very much , have a good weekend . 
206623:125	###Roy Donson , House Builders ' Federation . ###I 'd like to take up some points as they 've occurred this morning . 
206671:24	###Yes we support the principle , but the question about whether or not it should be in Ryedale district has not been erm answered by our members , and indeed it it we consider it should have wait , I mean this is answering something that 'll be discussed at later within this issue , something that should not be er assessed until after the er ###Well , let 's put it on the shelf for the time being . 
206737:138	###The the original purpose was to to deal with problems arising within the city of York . ###If you feel from the discussion around the table that the u requirements of York have not been properly reflected in the the published H One figure er and that there is a need to distribute that population , and therefore there is going to be a Greater York figure . 
206738:199	###If you feel from the discussion around the table that the u requirements of York have not been properly reflected in the the published H One figure er and that there is a need to distribute that population , and therefore there is going to be a Greater York figure . ###The overlap with the districts needs to be eradicated , it 's a black hole at the moment , every district can pass a its surplus on to another district , and indeed it would be the last district to prepare a district wide local plan that has to meet the residue of the Greater York requirement , it may maybe a good stimulus for the districts to get on with their local plans , but that 's not an planning way . 
206879:107	###Ian Smith , Ryedale District . ###I 'd like to comment on Mr Grigson 's table , in particular the figure proposed for Ryedale , er his figure is based on the assumption that because Selby gets the new settlement it therefore gets a corresponding reduction in house building elsewhere in the Greater York portion of Selby . 
206988:79	###The eighty nine strategy was actually supported by four of the authorities including the County Council , but clearly , and I fully appreciate why that decision was made two districts particularly , Ryedale and Selby , felt unable to support the strategy . ###The City Council , faced with the view that er there was two thousand shortfall in dwellings , that clearly two of our most important neighbours in terms of their land area were unhappy with that proposal , agreed to er proceed to pursue the issue of the new settlement . 
207023:28	###Yes go on . ###Erm , the the reference of last resort was Mr Thomas 's reference erm it it is not a reference which I think you find anywhere er in government guidance , and I think what P P G thre three says is the opportunity to to pursue them will be relatively rare , we think this is a relatively rare circumstance , er in North Yorkshire , it 's unique , er and it 's entirely driven er by justifiable er reasons to protect the the wider environment of Greater York . 
207084:153	###Well I was trying to stick with the size as an expression of whether the concept is one that should be pursued , and whether that influences the pursuing of the concept , can we can we leave the , the number of settlements till , till later on ? ###Right . 
207119:29	###Clive Brook , Clive Brook associates . ###For a city the nature of York it is vital , in my view , that public confidence in the greenbelt it 's got to endure for beyond thirty years , that is the case I would share the views to some extent of the York City in that , and which I I certainly read into ma ' am , your , two of your questions , what happens beyond two thousand and six ? 
207119:52	###Clive Brook , Clive Brook associates . ###For a city the nature of York it is vital , in my view , that public confidence in the greenbelt it 's got to endure for beyond thirty years , that is the case I would share the views to some extent of the York City in that , and which I I certainly read into ma ' am , your , two of your questions , what happens beyond two thousand and six ? 
207122:249	###If you then say , ah well it might expand to double that number or to five thousand , as was postulated , that then begs an even larger question , because in my submission you would then go back and revisit the alternatives of , for example , should you expand Tadcaster , which has not the best facilities in its town centre , er to quote but one example of er viability and sustainability of towns . ###You would look at Tadcaster versus a settlement of four five thousand in the Greater York area . 
207132:110	###These development strategies should seek to preserve an acceptable balance of the various priorities , now in my position statement I set out the role and general advantages of new settlements as part of a development strategy in satisfying housing and employment needs of an area . ###In particular I think that the new settlement strategy proposed in the structure plan is of particular relevance er to the needs of Greater York , focused as it is on the historic city . 
207139:44	###I think a settlement of this size would be compatible with the general pattern of village development that exists in the York area , if a new settlement were significantly larger than this pattern I think there would be a high degree of risk of coalescence with the existing er communities , and would certainly threaten their identity . ###As there is indeed a need to reduce car dependency it therefore follows that the nearer to York that the new settlement is then the greater the benefits could result , equally to , the further that the new settlement is from York then I think the less it will have an effect in reducing the pressures for development upon York . 
207161:19	###Turning to erm the reasons erm for the Council 's erm objection with particular reference to er paragraph erm thirty three of P P G three , erm I think it 's first of all , and it should be abundantly obvious to all present now that since the County Council emba and the Greater York authorities , embarked upon this strategy government guidance has changed , we believe erm government guidance now casts serious doubts erm on the erm new settlement strategy for Greater York . ###And we think that it would be an excessive size er for that particular locality , and it would n't really fit in erm with er the path of the settlement pattern . 
207190:135	###Now in terms of the cr the need for development , I 'm sure the panel will have read all the evidence which has been put in about the long history of the varying impact studies o on development on around Greater York , and those date back of course to the February eighty nine report which I I think you 'll have seen copies of . ###Now my my conclusion from that , and I think is a conclusion which has been supported by the public on con during the consultation exercise on the Greater York study , was that peripheral development around Greater York would have an undue impact on the historic character of the city , and that of course is the fundamental , the protection of which is of course a fundamental aim of planning around Greater York . 
207249:27	###those words were carefully chosen as as I 'm sure sure you 'd expect them to be . ###Our involvements st with this project started way back in nineteen eighty nine , went into a series of meetings which most recent I attended at the Greater York authorities , we learnt the full scale and extent of the housing land problems in the Greater York area , we of course have no part in the decisions which have been made by the Greater York authorities , nor in the plans they subsequently made for the York greenbelt , but clearly we remain closely interested in the outcome . 
207249:214	###those words were carefully chosen as as I 'm sure sure you 'd expect them to be . ###Our involvements st with this project started way back in nineteen eighty nine , went into a series of meetings which most recent I attended at the Greater York authorities , we learnt the full scale and extent of the housing land problems in the Greater York area , we of course have no part in the decisions which have been made by the Greater York authorities , nor in the plans they subsequently made for the York greenbelt , but clearly we remain closely interested in the outcome . 
207257:138	###But in our eyes that exercise needs to be conducted before the plan reaches its final approval . ###Just how that 's going to be accomplished we do n't know , we 're not party to the discussions , we understand that the Greater York authorities do plan to meet shortly after the end of this examination , but just what further work is necessary before they then get onto the location aspects we do n't know about that , all I would say is that we would expect final plan to have the general location of a new settlement embodied in in that plan before it is approved . 
207361:10	###In terms of Easingwold , I have a client who owns about forty acres who would be delighted with that solution but erm , I do n't think that Easingwold could support that level of development , if we 're talking a around about two thousand dwellings , without very very substantial harm to its character and setting . ###This is a historic town , I I disagree with Mr Jewitt upon the emphasis he gives to that , but I do agree with him that a limit the type , the scale of growth which that solution would imply would be hurtful , would be very , extremely harmful to the town . 
207362:34	###This is a historic town , I I disagree with Mr Jewitt upon the emphasis he gives to that , but I do agree with him that a limit the type , the scale of growth which that solution would imply would be hurtful , would be very , extremely harmful to the town . ###It also must be remembered er that the transport links to Easingwold would not be good enough to support that level of development , it does not have a rail station and it does it , and the A nineteen is only a single carriageway road , and would need ld need isagree with Mr Jewitt upon re 1 
207419:161	###Chairman . ###Er Terry Heselton , Sel Selby District . 
207422:12	###Thank you very much . ###York , I take it , are not in favour of a new settlement ? 
207444:171	###Moving on to to Mr Curtis , I do n't want to dwell and re re er restate the the difference I had with Mr Curtis this morning , but again he did start a little bit of a red herring running by talking about the major commitment for retailing facilities , er there is a major commitment for retailing facilities in Greater York , er a degree of all provision . ###But the level of all provision of course is in terms of comparison goods , and in terms of large shopping malls . 
207558:7	###I had him up there . ###And another horse called Dormant up up , up the phantom stud . 
207573:7	###You 're never off . ###As soon as the bell goes you 're in trouble int you ? 
207594:40	###or for the week ? ###for the whole week you know . 
207658:14	###let them pull a cow collar , wi it was what they call cow collar learn , the way to learn them . ###And then lead them with this to come with . 
207662:14	###That 's how you 're taught . ###So you got a , er , your mare in one hand and your foal in the other , int ya ? 
207669:34	###Yeah well they , they was used to it . ###Lady Road Mentmore , just the same . 
207725:17	###Four . ###Four was it ? 
207728:9	###And the valuation was two hundred and fifty thousand . ###The valuation of them . 
207730:32	###And you had to stay with them all the while ? ###Sheldrake Burrows that was Stud . 
207731:64	###Sheldrake Burrows that was Stud . ###. Whe when you went and you did n't have to leave them , you know . 
207733:27	###You was insured not to leave yo wha you I was in charge of them horses , you must n't leave them . ###So , could you , could you 
207740:7	###What happened if you wanted to pop to the loo ? ###Oh ! 
207742:7	###You have to do it inside the box . ###Get inside the box and do it . 
207911:30	###We had an come to near , Morris and Co had gone to Ireland . ###When they arrive in Eddington , go on , go on to , take the plane and go on with the plane to Ireland . 
208009:18	###Yeah . ###Yeah . 
208014:16	###You had little nets and big nets . ###As long as they was eating they were alright you see . 
208018:9	###Yeah . ###And they said , and the plane shaked , course the , that rocks the plane . 
208025:78	###It 's terrible ! ###Oh yes , I 've had one or two one or two er I thi I ca n't think of the stallion 's name , he had a wall eye this beast did . 
208087:30	###But we never used to use them cos they was too big , you know . ###Too big . 
208089:15	###But if horse went on his own you 'd have to put it on . ###See ? 
208112:132	###Do n't matter who I pick , you know . ###Pick of the yearlings . 
208112:147	###Do n't matter who I pick , you know . ###Pick of the yearlings . 
208191:29	###Who d' ya get that off then ? ###Mm . 
208318:9	###Do n't believe in , I said er er could n't do anything . ###And I could n't say nowt . 
208318:25	###Do n't believe in , I said er er could n't do anything . ###And I could n't say nowt . 
208318:41	###Do n't believe in , I said er er could n't do anything . ###And I could n't say nowt . 
208338:37	###What ? ###What are the duties of the head man ? 
208345:48	###You understand ? ###Yeah . 
208361:32	###But ' s lads , you ca n't train horses , you 've gotta tell them , tell him everything exactly . ###Yeah . 
208370:7	###They do n't say nothing . ###In your day how many horses would you have when you were head lad ? 
208468:13	###Old horses want more time and le than two years olds do . ###Cos they do n't want the time , they do n't want two hours dragging about on their legs . 
208487:12	###Today , they got so many horses , like , Cecil got hundred and forty , and ' s hundred and forty , well so you got three lots you ca n't do it . ###He th they , they 're not finished here till one o' clock and after you see . 
208487:26	###Today , they got so many horses , like , Cecil got hundred and forty , and ' s hundred and forty , well so you got three lots you ca n't do it . ###He th they , they 're not finished here till one o' clock and after you see . 
208498:10	###And then I 'll go down and ge for the governor and say , alright governor ? ###All ready . 
208525:29	###It 's my job to keep all the wounds clean . ###And dress them you see . 
208544:9	###Yeah . ###Pleases the owner . 
208559:7	###Mhm . ###everything . 
208712:27	###You push over the , as long as you got over the . ###I used to do , get them to have all their heads round and go round and do them . 
208734:9	###Mm mm . ###Well some lads have Christmas and some having Boxing Day . 
208750:8	###Well , the other men in the yard . ###Oh . 
208750:26	###Well , the other men in the yard . ###Oh . 
208758:18	###Mm . ###after mine . 
208772:42	###See you can do that now , but years ago if yo well did n't , they would n't allow you to do it . ###Oh no , they would n't allow you , if you ca n't stop and do your horses we do n't want to know you . 
208793:21	###He knows what weight all of you got . ###And then , off you go and make them ready and when you get out onto the heath you just , the horses what 's galloping together , you 've all been weighed out and then who 's riding them and they all take the sheets off and they er straightaway . 
208854:13	###He knows what he 's galloping , he knows within a few pounds what he wants . ###Put him on so and so , and so and so on that , and change them about . 
208911:7	###No ! ###No . 
208925:17	###Mm . ###But just steady the traffic . 
208925:43	###Mm . ###But just steady the traffic . 
208933:36	###were these horse walks put in ? ###Oh , they 've been here about a few years now . 
208941:42	###Did they ? ###Paid for the roads being done up and everything you know . 
208976:149	###And the form that I return to is the form of human being , erm , that 's the form that I have and whatever individuates Socrates from Plato erm is not a matter of the form because they have exactly the same form . ###In fact , whatever individuates these two happens only at the level of matter or the soul bodily things . 
209000:116	###Yeah , so I mean it 's an inward journey . ###Right , right . 
209001:145	###Right , right . ###So , if that is the case how can we possibly lose our identity because we have n't , we 're not , there 's no suggestion if we go on an inward journey , the inward journey must be within our selves , within our individuality , not , not jumping out into some form of spacial context . 
209028:108	###No piece of chalk had moved across the front of me . ###Rather , erm , one was in one position and then a second took up a different position . 
209208:103	###Sure ###So , I do n't know . 
209217:64	###Erm , does this suffice for individuation ? ###No , well , toss that aside . 
209253:56	###Sure , no problem there . ###You certainly do n't want your tools running you , but the , the crucial is that the tool is a completely separate thing from us . 
209291:16	###There ###You 're talking about a group of individual things 
209531:85	###But we 're working on that . ###Looking at Penguin er , it was a very difficult year but the profit you see was erm , is after providing for the losses up to the date we disposed of Smith Mark and also making further provision on , on er , leases when we moved out of the other buildings , centralized the editorial and er , administrative functions into one office and , and but for that you would see that the er , the Penguin profit would have moved ahead from the year before . 
209561:7	###Extraordinary profits , you may be surprised to see are only twelve point nine million after the Elserver sale but that is a function of the write back of good will on the disposal of Elserver which you will see explained in the preliminary statement , thus reducing the er , profit from two hundred and twenty nine million , which was the estimate at the interim , to thirty five million for the year as a whole . ###We did that in the with the erm , urgent issues task force new standard on good will . 
209630:96	###Why have you not done so ? ###Er , there are a couple of factors there . 
209631:17	###Er , there are a couple of factors there . ###One is that we do make acquisitions , we on , on the whole er , prefer er , organic growth because it is normally more profitable and the prices you have to pay for acquisitions er , tend to put significant premiums on the companies you buy which you may er , in the longer run eventually erm , er , turn into shareholder value . 
209631:41	###Er , there are a couple of factors there . ###One is that we do make acquisitions , we on , on the whole er , prefer er , organic growth because it is normally more profitable and the prices you have to pay for acquisitions er , tend to put significant premiums on the companies you buy which you may er , in the longer run eventually erm , er , turn into shareholder value . 
209674:38	###Money from the business . ###Just to clear another point up . 
209695:20	###I think that it is going to have a good effect on improving trading for the better parks and attractions in this country and as you know I think , Alton Towers is the leading er , park of its kind in this country , Chessington which we also own is the second er , leading park , one and a half million visitors a year , Alton Towers approximately two million visitors a year in this country . ###Both offering excellent value for money . 
209709:32	###We might make the odd selective acquisition but not vast amounts of money going on acquisitions there either . ###Erm , on entertainment , we 're spending a lot of money on organic growth and have done over the past two or three years and er , it 's very well spent but again , we 're growing our businesses , erm , er , rather than acquiring them . 
209721:193	###Clearly , if it did we 'd be interested . ###Is your cost er , programme effectively complete er , or are we gonna be seeing more substantial redundancies this year ? 
209726:7	###I think that it is difficult to see under any clear complexion of government that our present holdings er , in newspapers , which are mainly the Financial Times which has a small erm , comparatively small circulation for a national newspaper and less than twenty percent in a television company would , would be affected by , by any government . ###Er , whether they , a different government would legislate erm , against people having more than a twenty percent stake in er , B Sky B for instance remains to be seen . 
209735:63	###It 's more in the second half . ###My colleague Mr who is closer to the ground reminds me that I think there was a small provision in the first half . 
209860:50	###Er , Michael . ###The erm , total figure will end up , it is n't all completely spent yet , but it 'll end up er , something between eight and ten million pounds . 
209880:29	###The erm , entrance price increases generally have been in line or slightly above inflation . ###We normally aim and have achieved very successfully in recent years real price increases above inflation . 
209949:136	###Book sales show a , a nice increase in er , in sales revenue , especially in the U K , which is up seventeen percent overall . ###Penguin U K is gaining sale and market share and in North America the sales are only slightly down on last year , which was a very exceptional year anyway .

210176:89	###Well , one of the reasons it er , bucked the trend was because ###Is this Les Echo ? 
210320:28	###ya ###Wh anybody with a bursting ambition and desire to be on the working party ? 
210399:60	###Erm , she actually traced back calls on the station log and it was done from the first of October nineteen ninety two to the thirtieth of September nineteen ninety three and during that time we had over five thousand three hundred and thirty calls , of which one thousand one hundred and sixty six originated from , so that is erm twenty point three percent of the calls received at police station and were held on came from , which is quite a lot . ###True true 
210413:34	###So hopefully by the erm , I should be in a position by the next Council meeting , to report that we should be in a position to be up and running on the seventeenth of January . ###The problems er that face me accommodation have been overcome with the assistance of the Chairman and the Town Clerk ah and we have been offered additional accommodation here in the Council offices , which is most welcome . 
210425:146	###I 've moved back into and er I 'd just like to say I 'm sure on behalf of all of you and the people of that we see this as a tremendous move and thank you for the work you 've put in . ###Er , I 've been fortunate enough to share in some of that work with you and I know how much work 's been involved . 
210482:18	###An elderly lady , this weekend actually , i it sounds funny but it 's rather serious what she said actually . ###We are now buying ourselves white sticks that we do n't really need to help us cross the road .

210499:30	###requiring travel through the town centre , the town centre that was designed and built for horse-drawn traffic . ###The development of this site in nineteen ninety three is unacceptable and must be not be approved . 
210538:207	###I see no reason for us actually to go through the whole pros and cons . ###We 've made our view quite clear . 
210544:90	###That has been our major worry and I think for us now to go away and just allow it to go ahead , twenty years on , without any improvements , without the link road and without improvements to Hill I think is an abdication of our duties and I really do think that . ###Right , it 's been suggested by Councillor that we write a letter to . 
210574:7	###Thank you very much . ###Right , with that I 'm gonna take you on if you 're all agreed , and I think you 've already agreed , some of you , most of you , that we go on to item nine . 
210649:10	###Any matters arising from that meeting ? ###Yes Chairman . 
210718:63	###I am a little surprised that the Planning Committee decided to go to look at the hockey club but not eighty seven houses in . ###Thank you . 
210750:10	###If it had have been , if we 'd have known we 'd have pulled the tables further , pulled the tables further across that way . ###Right . 
210821:81	###There is an equivalent section that relates to criminal evidence which allows a , a statement to be introduced but only where the needs , where the , I hate that word , the , where justice requires it to be introduced . ###And the purpose of that section is to prevent trials becoming paper trials where the prosecution do not call evidence . 
210869:15	###I heard say suppose I ###It 's hearsay . 
210910:12	###Okay ? ###It is no longer hearsay . 
210916:30	###Alright , now . ###I now want to go to back to the beginning of the statement . 
210947:66	###So , if gives evidence , having become competent because he has pleaded guilty , erm , then we can cross-examine him , but we are in difficulties if we then bring up his previous convictions attack his credibility . ###In the same way as you lose your shield whenever you attack a prosecution witness . 
211005:42	###Okay ? ###Unless what ? 
211070:67	###This may well be for those of you who did in fact agree . ###I do n't think that the erm go into this properly and I do n't , I think will have dealt with it in lectures , but essentially there 's a common law principle that says if a matter is more prejudicial than evidential it should not be read . 
211109:16	###I do n't think it would be right to do so . ###The judge should exclude it . 
211155:10	###Of course , if you were to give evidence , what would the co what would the magistrates do ? ###They 'd warn themselves . 
211421:116	###We 've done quite an extensive survey around Ottery , looking at the times people use these facilities , and the weekends , especially Saturdays , is the favoured time . ###What we 're planning to do in the very early stages , is to have the site staffed on a Saturday , and have people there , so we can actually turn away rubbish . 
211468:25	###So she was writing to him at the time I telephoned . ###He 's getting the letter and has promised that action will be taken , so I , it 's only words at the moment . 
211493:7	###And that 's precepted to use by March of ninety four . ###Okay . 
211551:96	###Well string timbers up and you build it up , and the whole lot comes down . ###Yeah , well all I can say , is that I 've seen the building and I would I would think th that it 's no problem . 
211577:74	###No , I mean , they constituted , they 're insured ###I know that , I mean , er , we what Paul said , is basically that , we could have problems , if it , if it did go wrong . 
211577:110	###No , I mean , they constituted , they 're insured ###I know that , I mean , er , we what Paul said , is basically that , we could have problems , if it , if it did go wrong . 
211610:7	###But surely that is n't the case , I mean that , you know , we ca n't be responsible for the way in which all these groups actually behave and all the rest ###I , I , I agree with you 
211687:15	###If you wanna give them half of that . ###Two fifty . 
211692:35	###work out all the way down . ###I 've added it all up . 
211782:7	###Yeah . ###They do . 
211827:15	###I think just to answer that the , the pitch , because obviously I looked into this , and tried to get a reduction , ###Yes . 
211846:20	###Yeah . ###Yes , I agree with that . 
211872:12	###at the end of , no we wo n't . ###At the end of the night , we 're still gonna have some money , which we 've gotta get spent , or w would hope to get spent by next March , so we 're gonna have you to come in again . 
211952:7	###Anybody second that ? ###All those in favour ? 
211952:15	###Anybody second that ? ###All those in favour ? 
211986:13	###Erm , at the moment , they 're looking to give , possibly a prefer a preferential grant to the one that 's there now for any cost of a hiring from Devon County Council . ###They said what they mean by using it properly , I mean 
212011:18	###Yeah . ###It 's , it 's got quite a lot erm , users who would be without a home , albeit boxing club . 
212022:103	###Now then , that 's one , one is the squad room , Air Training Corps . ###Now the reason we 've got this , is there are quite a few erm , Ottery boys who are members of this corps , and get taken down there by bus every Friday evening , and the Town Clerk erm , went to speak to them . 
212046:7	###Yes , yes . ###the thing I 'm thinking about , I mean terribly keen on , you know , training wh whatever the basis for it is , I mean , we do n't want to start a discussion on that . 
212047:39	###the thing I 'm thinking about , I mean terribly keen on , you know , training wh whatever the basis for it is , I mean , we do n't want to start a discussion on that . ###But must but I do n't know how much further I want to go along that sort of line . 
212060:160	###Yeah . ###I mean we do support , do n't we , things like the talking newspaper across the area , because there 's , and we do support like erm , Mrs ' s holiday for youngsters , although they are not all Ottery kids , but I mean the fact of the matter is , I think we would need each time we look at any of this , that there are Ottery youngsters involved . 
212166:25	###I mean , it 's , I seem to be talking quite a bit here tonight . ###I 'm glad you came . 
212178:12	###What we 've done tonight , is spread that amount of money over a tremendous number of people tonight ###Yes , yes , yes , yes . 
212317:115	###But there you are . ###All things within the town . 
212395:24	###Give them a new target . ###Well . 
212439:32	###I 'm pleased you 've all seen the state of it . ###But I do n't think there 's any action . 
212445:49	###On the solicitor 's advice we held it . ###Erm , in the letter that you s sending by fax tomorrow , you tend to indicate that it is held while the matter 's sorted . 
212460:21	###Well , that 's what you 've got to be careful of . ###Gentlemen , I , I , I do believe , fellow councillors , what we 've done now is asked the solicitor to , to take the matter in hand , and so I do think until we 've got advice from him , it would be for us to actually recommend any other 
212489:7	###yeah . ###Well , I think what we gotta do . 
212495:21	###But we 've now found that and it 's gone to the solicitor 's . ###In the me we had n't actually had a chance go through it properly ourselves . 
212598:18	###This matter was approved and myself , Deputy Chairman , rural area area planning ###They 've done nothing . 
212612:7	###I think they 're let us know what they 've done . ###Yes , er , I thought the council afraid does n't understand 
212766:7	###There we go . ###Application two is a full application for a Mr , Mr in for a detached garage at . 
212787:7	###It does . ###It appears we 've done the same thing with the brick and the flints . 
212838:23	###This application is only the grounds . ###Mm . 
212876:19	###Yeah . ###and I do n't believe that is detailed for us , has enabled us sit here and say , yes , A there 's room for them , and B there 's enough parking , and C there 's enough turning . 
212879:15	###I would support er , most of what Councillor has said . ###What , what worries me as well , is the parking . 
212898:119	###Yes ###backing up , when I er , at , at the appeal , the medical centre made a very long presentation over the proximity , the closeness to their erm , surgery and they argued about the height of buildings , now it got passed as sheltered united , er , which means elderly and quiet occupancy . 
212935:82	###Mm . ###so we were able to consider that . 
212937:7	###Well , of course , we ca n't consider that this time , because it 's outline so , so we ca n't , you know , you must con ###Mm . 
212951:34	###You ca n't have both of it . ###Well except some , some of these reasons were actually still quite clear , despite the state of the plan . 
212972:13	###That it would never get passed , just on highways alone . ###That was the officers ' view at the time . 
212998:11	###No at all ###No at all . 
213123:24	###how do we stand legally ? ###Okay . 
213158:12	###And er , all the neighbours are extremely happy to see a pair of cottages , rather than any new conversion ###What about the traffic , though ? 
213280:7	###Yes ###Yeah , but it 's very , it is very unfortunate , in my view , the way this system , it 's not this council , it 's East Devon that mishandled this . 
213295:7	###It looks to me on the plan , ###though that it looks such a flimsy structure , that you know its gonna be shored up with walls . 
213298:12	###On the application , the walls are in wood , and that 's as much you get with a polycarbonate roof . ###Yeah . 
213342:19	###Tomorrow night . ###Sorry ? 
213454:92	###So protectionism , I mean there 's still protectionism if you 're taxing your exports , it 's a t so protectionism is , is not er , a recent phenomenon , however , the extent of protectionism has risen dramatically in this century , particularly since the Second World War . ###Okay , so why might protectionism erm , affect world trade ? 
213454:101	###So protectionism , I mean there 's still protectionism if you 're taxing your exports , it 's a t so protectionism is , is not er , a recent phenomenon , however , the extent of protectionism has risen dramatically in this century , particularly since the Second World War . ###Okay , so why might protectionism erm , affect world trade ? 
213470:44	###Alright , so supporting agriculture right , means losses elsewhere in the economy , and this is why protectionism is always a bad , is always a bad thing in terms of net welfare . ###Alright , although the farmers are benefiting alright , from protectionism alright , you know , we 're , we as tax payers and consumers , are diverting er , resources into agriculture away from somewhere else . 
213574:28	###Can you think of a reason why that , that might be the case ? ###Why if prices fall , right , should output rise , or might it rise , any ideas ? 
213576:43	###Because er , to produce more output you have to have a bigger stock , and therefore the price goes up , so you produce more , decreasing not quite so much , and keep a greater percentage than you did last year , so that for cows , as the price goes up you 've got to counteract it again , cows this year , and try to sort of , keep my , get my herd bigger and bigger , and profitable . ###Alright , so what 's coming now is this idea of time is very important in agricultural supply response . 
213578:220	###Right , if we want to increase the long run output we may have to reduce short run output . ###Okay yes , that is er , very good , very good example . 
213627:58	###Why do we need a dynamic specification ? ###Well , we ought to recognize that if prices are increased there wo n't be an instantaneous er , change in supply which in inferred from our static models . 
213830:93	###Alright , so there 's plenty of scope for differentiation , product differentiation . ###And also , erm , there 's great scope for economies of scale er , in manufactured goods , therefore consumers can benefit , right from er , exploiting the comparative advantage in particular , in particular countries . 
213830:99	###Alright , so there 's plenty of scope for differentiation , product differentiation . ###And also , erm , there 's great scope for economies of scale er , in manufactured goods , therefore consumers can benefit , right from er , exploiting the comparative advantage in particular , in particular countries . 
213880:12	###Yes ###erm , domestic country , or the country where the protectionism is in place . 
213905:10	###Fortunately I was n't expecting to be lecturing , but er , ###Right 
213982:7	###Sorry ? ###If we do n't live off agricultural trade , what are we going to live on ? 
213996:30	###You know , that problem is n't the most important one . ###Why , why do we want to liberalize world trade ? 
213997:29	###Why , why do we want to liberalize world trade ? ###So we can reduce the prices that we have to pay for everything . 
214013:109	###Clearly farmers in protecting countries benefit , any anybody else that benefits ? ###From protectionism ? 
214072:39	###They said that at , someone from third year last year er , she said that Professor is having an extra lecture you know , telling what 's on the exam those things . ###Well , if he tells you , he 's er , he 's in the min minority . 
214114:79	###Cost of migration . ###Okay , what 's , what do you mean by that ? 
214171:120	###Tribe . ###Tribe , or whatever . 
214218:66	###Whatever , you ca n't apply the urban type of capital back onto the land , so it 's okay to say this would work if capital was completely and perfectly mobile , but it is n't so , you do n't get that and you do n't get balanced growth of that . ###Because er , everything shifts in the wrong direction . 
214286:20	###Always re bear in mind , that whenever you do a short answer question , right , you 've only got fifteen minutes to do it in . ###Right , there , there is n't a great deal that you can get in , in fifteen minutes . 
214287:92	###Right , there , there is n't a great deal that you can get in , in fifteen minutes . ###But what , what you must have , right , is a definition of erm , the er , sort of thing that you 're asked to write about . 
214287:100	###Right , there , there is n't a great deal that you can get in , in fifteen minutes . ###But what , what you must have , right , is a definition of erm , the er , sort of thing that you 're asked to write about . 
214290:15	###Right now , although the determinals in industrial specialization within countries , alright , now although you ca n't really define that , you might be able to say something about industrial specialization . ###You know it 's fairly obvious what it is , but with most of these will , will require , require a definition . 
214291:31	###You know it 's fairly obvious what it is , but with most of these will , will require , require a definition . ###Right , so you must put a definition , a definition in there . 
214295:63	###Right now you may , erm , do n't know anything in particular , but I know that the European Community and the United , United States are always trying to out , erm , beat each other in terms of subsidies on food products , so put , put that in . ###Reciprocal dumping , erm , you know , one very good example would be agricultural trade between European Community and erm , and America . 
214298:10	###Any form of empirical evidence is useful , alright , erm sometimes you know , you 're asked , you know , what is the effective protection , or define , or write brief a brief essay on effective protection , right you 'll , you 'll want to say something there about how it 's measured . ###You know , nobody 's expecting three or four sides , right , you 've got quarter of an hour , not erm , you know , if , if you can write a side a half you , you 'll be doing much better than most people , alright , so you 're just thinking about a side really , depending on how big your handwriting is . 
214306:61	###Question , question one , question two , alright . ###It 's a pretty complicated diagram , I would n't expect you to draw that in fifteen minutes , and explain the , the 
214347:15	###What we are actually going to do today is to look using this data , is to look at structural stability , right , we 're going to ask ourselves are the parameters that we estimate over the entire sample , are they constant over time . ###There 's no point in estimating a model if in reality those coefficients are not fixed , they 're jumping all over the place . 
214436:19	###He is a famous chap Dick . ###If you 've got time it might be worth spending an hour listening to him . 
214523:127	###Clearly the labour is geographically mobile , it 's not occupationally mobile , so the people that move do n't necessarily have the skills required to take up these high wages . ###You obvious , supposed high wages in the urban area . 
214574:13	###If we again discount this income at the time or get it looks like that . ###So this now represents the discounted value of the urban wage overtime . 
214643:7	###Yes , fifty given it exactly the same way . ###It 's much easier to get good marks on a short answer question than it is in theory to but most people do n't because they do n't apply the correct technique so to writing short answers . 
214643:153	###Yes , fifty given it exactly the same way . ###It 's much easier to get good marks on a short answer question than it is in theory to but most people do n't because they do n't apply the correct technique so to writing short answers . 
214643:182	###Yes , fifty given it exactly the same way . ###It 's much easier to get good marks on a short answer question than it is in theory to but most people do n't because they do n't apply the correct technique so to writing short answers . 
214645:77	###We must have in a short answer like there 's a definition , most of the concepts there will be erm defined effective protection , its optimal , optimal tariff , trained creation , or trained diversion , there will be concepts that need definition , economic jargon , so you must have an equal er definition in there and you must have examples of how this concept is used , right say erm er one of those about do n't make reciprocal dumping . ###er and then discuss any problems that there might be , is it a contentious issue ? 
214649:18	###Yeah . ###Rather than a lot about 
214650:9	###Rather than a lot about ###That 's what you must do , if you get , if you write a lot about a couple of things they 'll say erm this chap 's knowledge is pretty specialized on this area , you know what , what these er short answer questions are picking up right is your , is your general knowledge . 
214711:93	###Now we 've got the small sample version which is an F distribution . ###Now what I recommend is that you always use the F version of any of these diagnostic test statistics and we can go on to look at the others erm in a moment . 
214743:77	###Right , in this particular case it is of no serial correlation is our null hypothesis . ###Right so again large test statistics whether they 're Ts Fs or kie squares . 
214752:9	###Right so if you look at erm the Chow test at the bottom of your screens , right the F test , right is an F three in seventeen test . ###Three in the numerator denotes that we are making three restrictions to be restricting our parameters of three parameters in this particular model , constant , coefficient on , log of prices and log of you are restricting those er at a zero when we estimate over the entire , over the ent the entire sample okay and yeah 
214757:7	###as in this case we go down the three column , the three is a in the numerator N one , right , till we reach seventeen , right , and now test to see if it 's three point two right , so if we ###our Chow test here indicates strongly that we have structural change because we 've got a test statistic of twenty two , right , far away , different from three point two our critical value . 
214763:164	###Although it does have lower , lower power than his first test , right , but if you ca n't calculate his first test then it 's the best thing to use . ###Right , okay , erm let 's now move on to er these other diagnostics , right , like test for structural change these diagnostic test statistics that are calculated for right , because essentially what they 're doing is that they 're testing the assumptions on which ordinary leased squares is based . 
214822:34	###We all like to think we can do things and we can do things well . ###It actually helps our morale does n't it and it sort of helps our confidence . 
214822:218	###We all like to think we can do things and we can do things well . ###It actually helps our morale does n't it and it sort of helps our confidence . 
214833:52	###Yeah . ###We need to sort of plan we need to grow people , develop people . 
214859:38	###Line Managers and Supervisors as well are , are responsible for training because as a Line Manager or a Supervisor you 're responsible are n't you for training and developing people . ###That is one of your accountabilities to develop others and training falls into that . 
214865:13	###If they 're not properly trained it 's not their fault , people can only do what they can do ca n't they ? ###If th they do n't know if people are not properly trained they are making mistakes then it does make more work does n't it ? 
214867:39	###Because the mistakes have to be rectified and it puts us under even more pressure because you 've got even less time . ###So training we do need to make the time otherwise it does become a catch twenty two situation . 
214869:7	###But as you said if it is your responsibility you 'll have to do it all yourself , there are lots of resources and lots of other people who can actually help you out who have the knowledge and you can use because you can use it as a development tool ca n't you for some of your members of the section to to give them some training expertise . ###Right so we 'll just look at the sort of er the negative side of not making the time that we get more mistakes . 
215090:35	###Organizational skills . ###Organizational skills . 
215103:10	###It becomes . ###Can you remember the tre I nearly killed myself then , another thing you 'll learn about training is er that all should be put down and around but if it , if we were to go receptionist now you 've got the idea of key tasks anyway . 
215198:235	###If somebody new comes along there it is here 's our training programme for this person new person . ###Yeah , do n't you feel as though you take some care of them . 
215215:13	###The contents relies entirely on ###Yeah depends might go away 
215219:7	###If you could quickly scan down and see what somebody 's done and the levels of competency they 've achieved , it helps you think that why are n't they doing the job , it might not be a trainee , it might be somebody else . ###Another area now this , this is , this is one of my favourite things . 
215238:45	###What happens when Mrs B goes on holiday or goes off sick ? ###Who copes , how many people can do task two ? 
215368:7	###No matter what you do they just cannot seem to learn . ###They got you know , their mind is full up with what they 've got , they 've got no room for any improvement . 
215369:47	###They got you know , their mind is full up with what they 've got , they 've got no room for any improvement . ###We have to accept that in life do n't we ? 
215381:18	###A little exercise for you to finish up with , not finish up this bit . ###Five minutes . 
215437:84	###What I want to spend a few minutes on again this is something we 'll test tomorrow , right so I 'm giving you , training 's all about doing what do you think ? ###What ? 
215448:18	###This will build up obviously as we go through the course . ###The first , the first one that we 're really gonna test you on is gonna be testing is tomorrow morning . 
215504:28	###So there 's your objective , it 's got to be specific and re-focused on an , on an activity and we should be able to measure training , not always easy is it ? ###Something about skills you know like telephone technique you know how can you measure somebody 's telephone technique ? 
215543:12	###Why the fact that they can complete it . ###Perhaps it 's that encompasses that , that is your objective , the second one the trainee will understand how to complete , what does your audience think ? 
215554:52	###You would n't would you ? ###And I would n't be able to attest it . 
215629:23	###Now what d' ya think the answer to that is ? ###And this husky voice from the other side 
215720:35	###Now there 's another thing questions what I 'm saying is that 's something to take away with you , or perhaps you wo n't get the chance er try now er . ###Certainly you should encourage people to answer questions . 
215805:7	###Yeah , but what does it do ? ###What do you do ? 
215892:10	###No , no no that does n't look a fig leaf , does that look like a fig leaf position to you ? ###Yeah 
215964:48	###Chances are you 're not gonna use it or or not use it . ###You write all this screed down and then you never look at it . 
216031:16	###I just , I just honest to God I had n't realized at all the guy was sort of and says er oh it 's probably I said no I 'm sure I was really cheesed . ###It was awful he said go and get it it 'll be in there and I just went er and I could see it all . 
216095:29	###It 's similarly with similar to the situation for training while the activist would like to get straight into a role of play , the reflector wants to stand back think about it , think about how they 're going to , what they 're going to do etcetera before they actually participate or get involved . ###Activists actually enjoy activities within training while they can carry out some research where they can analyze and investigate situations . 
216117:157	###Andy ? ###Yeah . 
216165:90	###you know it does n't mean to say that you 're wrong because you like to have a go or jump in and you 're not wrong if you like to have time to spend , there are no right or wrong styles and also what we ca n't associate the styles with , which people try to do sometimes is they try and identify the introverts and extroverts . ###I mean you ca n't do that there is no correlation between you ca n't say that all the activists are extroverts cos are actually quite about the way they but they do like to have a go and it does n't say all the reflectors cos they 're sitting back and thinking and they 're actually quiet reflectors . 
216196:118	###Maybe he 's a bit cranky about the scale so it may be a conscious decision that goes without . ###he 's feeling aggressive 
216250:30	###Done ? ###Looking good . 
216276:18	###So they sit there and you think there 's nothing being said but the atmosphere is very much full of aggression . ###Frequently is loud , but sometimes absolutely the complete opposite , silence can be actually very aggressive particularly with somebody you do n't normally get that silence from , you know they 're normally warm , pleasant individuals and all of a sudden silent and that 's actively aggressive as well . 
216301:120	###Yeah , I think that 's a good point , cos certainly if , if you 're towards the aggressive , we 've actually got go ###you might shout a bit louder , shout a bit louder and what happens if it does n't work . 
216339:49	###How you gonna deal with people who are , we get this side of the group to be aggressive people passive side , we 'll give the right hand side of the group as I 'm standing look at the passive people . ###How are you gonna deal with passive people on the right and how are you gonna deal with aggressive people . 
216420:23	###All the er , all the units are let , we 've had two , we 've had notice of two terminations coming up , but we have actually got a waiting list for units so I do n't think we 'll have any problem in filling those . ###Interestingly , all , all eighteen units on that site have been full from the day they were created , and that 's been a most successful run . 
216429:101	###Right , members will recall from the last meeting , there was an issue of it at Shrewsbury College , because of the transfer of the screw and ribbon factory to the college , or the College 's claim to the transfer of the screw and ribbon factory to them , because of the er , the cre the vesting of the College as an in independent body under the Higher Education Act . ###I think probably Chairman , it 's the best deal that we could get in the circumstances . 
216510:31	###The , the problem that is arising in this , is that it is now clear that , er , that the Grants Panel are running out of money this year , because of the take up of , of lots more grants . ###And it , they 're likely to need something like a further twenty thousand pounds er , if they do n't have sufficient funds to continue to at the balance of this financial year . 
216518:18	###at all ? ###Yes 
216518:206	###at all ? ###Yes 
216521:60	###True , yes , yes , yes , yes I 'd agree , Ivor , one point four , ###Which at this particular time is , is much more 
216521:134	###True , yes , yes , yes , yes I 'd agree , Ivor , one point four , ###Which at this particular time is , is much more 
216544:7	###The objective to funding from the old objective programme is we 've now learnt that we 've been successful in getting a grant made towards the Centre feasibility study , Shropshire welcomes Japan television advertisement on the Japanese , Japan area , towards the pipeworks promotion and the fly-drive marketing initiative because , er , to get people from North America into the marches and staying here , so it looks as those projects will be almost fifty percent funded from Europe to objective two . ###The Bridgenorse , Bridgenorth I beg your pardon initiative is proceeding er , in terms of an advisory group , and we have as a committee , a Councillor Tony , a regional member , recently take , took the place of er , Councillor on that group , and he is willing to continue . 
216569:40	###No , ###perhaps erm , we should note too , that the recommendation of the contribution of five thousand pounds , everybody happy with that ? 
216611:86	###No , the intention is before next year , by next year . ###Yes , yes , one extra job 
216765:13	###Chairman , I think this classically reinforces the argument for having regional government does it not ? ###And we could actually have that in the West Midlands , should there be such a regional government ever emerges . 
216777:8	###Quite a phenomenal achievement for the party to pool that number of quite diverse opinions together , professional , Country Landowners Association , all the District Councils , have done an excellent job of unity and cooperation , and I think that 's very , very welcome indeed . ###And I can honestly say , along with most people I 'm reluctantly coming round to the concept that the probability is that the county will cease to exist shortly , and there 'll be hopefully not more than two other authorities doing the job we 're currently doing . 
216806:59	###You know , there are a string of the things of this kind of nature to try to make village shops er , more viable to try and ensure their survival . ###Erm , there 's just one item which m might be added , or perhaps our representatives on this body could take it up some time , and that 's the amount of deposit which is needed by the post office from er , new tenants , I do n't know if they 're called tenants , or licensees whatever , to run rural post offices . 
216867:21	###Well , yes ###Of course it does , we look at the guidance notes , and they say things like the police and the health authorities want erm , larger units the size of the present County Council , I 'm sorry to go on . 
216882:175	###I 'll second it ###Two , two , two , two , one , yes 
216937:19	###Erm , some film producer sitting in London , thinks of a rural county , he 'll probably think of Shropshire , and I think this is typical example of how we can dribble away our scarce resources on a couple of thousand here , a couple of thousand there to other bodies , erm , I am , I 'm , I 'm against this proposal , we 'll keep our money for essential items . ###Mm , well , bread on the waters if not on the waters of the Severn , any other comments ? 
217032:119	###It actually should spend more , because it 's community , it 's helping to create the wealth of the county in the future , and that wealth of the county is what will pay for public services in the future . ###So there was , there 's a lot of sections of the community out , out there in terms of the business community , who have actually indicated that the County Council should be spending more in terms of economic development not less , and they criticized the Commission in terms of identifying some of the reductions which they have made erm , as part of this year 's budget alone . 
217061:101	###Can we not reach conclusions today which I sense has some possibility of consensus ? ###It really does come down to , I do n't know , I mean , every year we play it very honestly and very straight , and we push him in a position where next year , if there is a next year , I think the last time that we played it straight we got clobbered , so let 's pay a little bit less , and keep a bit back for when they come round a second time round . 
217114:26	###Do you want to comment on it ? ###It 's , it 's a r it 's an ongoing programme where they have sixty five thousand in , into er , deal with small problems , problems of a capital nature , but the far fixed er , man is pollution prevention , which is basically a legal requirement to stop effluent going into the stream and the like . 
217128:15	###Well does it act ? ###Does it , does it act that question , does it act in the modern way and if it does how much does it act in the modern way . 
217129:11	###Does it , does it act that question , does it act in the modern way and if it does how much does it act in the modern way . ###I mean you must see it yourself . 
217161:10	###but I do actually think that one considers they 're playing a part in the community . ###Now the part they play in the community depending on your political statistical or whatever leisure interest viewpoint may be that you think they have n't got the combination right but that 's obviously a very subjective thing , but I think that I mean the visibility and the social responsibility implements I would have thought are two of the most important for people . 
217196:137	###But I think that 's that is the erm educating managers and my , my own ###Yes 
217226:116	###Mm . ###Yes so that if for example a company called Twin Plugs or something says right we 're going to sponsor a concert , because we 're opening a new factory and we think this is special and we want to do something , we will put in ten thousand pounds . 
217234:143	###But in fact what they should be doing is planning effort into things which underpin the fabric of society and to underpin families ###Mm that 's right 
217235:221	###Mm that 's right ###and to deal with problems of substance abuse , unemployment , illiteracy , rather than things which are fashionable and to my mind highly like opera and the ballet which is n't to say that I do n't love them both , but I think that you have to have a sense of complete reality about the social issues . 
217247:9	###I think it would be to survive and to get the audience its erm its target audience was getting smaller and smaller ###Mm . 
217249:49	###and it had to appeal to a broader group . ###I mean last time I was at an opera was erm I had these tickets now erm I took my sister and a friend of hers . 
217262:73	###Okay as prices are cheaper , but you do have things like Coca Cola getting to those kind of things and everything else which you know where they might not to opera and it 's because it 's more popular and they know what they 're doing . ###talking to huge 
217310:19	###it was n't including sales . ###I mean there was a superb advert made by film director and he made a superb ad advertisement 
217327:25	###showing a bit of up Peter . ###I 'm just making an opportunity here 
217376:100	###insensitivity and cant ###I love that word cant 
217407:214	###Now that seems to me quite extraordinary ###Well if you remember what it is , let me know and I 'll buy the shopping from them and that is an influence for me . 
217509:46	###But anyway nineteen ninety three has been another successful year for the Garrick , which started , so far as the productions are concerned with the pantomime , Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves directed by Jill her debut as a director , hopefully not her last . ###It was also great to see some new faces in the pantomime this year and let 's hope that will be a continuing trend . 
217539:238	###Right , erm I 'll just go to the thing . ###We started off with five thousand six hundred and ninety one pounds last year this year we 've ended up with four thousand seven hundred and eighty eight pounds . 
217549:12	###which will actually reduce that figure ###That 's right . 
217550:54	###That 's right . ###but we obviously have to cut off at a certain time to er get the accounts and audited in time . 
217563:36	###Yeah , but er normally Alan er organizes this with our car park warden , but unfortunately as was stated it was struck with the flu . ###Yes . 
217592:29	###Er the nominations for chairman are and Graham . ###Right . 
217635:31	###He 's the next treasurer is n't he ? ###Yeah . 
217678:10	###So that they 're not having to find money for that as well as their ticket they get it sort of all in one price . ###tea and coffee 
217684:35	###Er I mean that , that 's not an attempt to dissuade or anyone but it , it you know people are very traditional and if the Garrick has always charged reasonably and suddenly there seems to be rate of inflation and this sort of thing , you know , as Linda said , they might think okay , I 'll pay three quid but I 'm damned if I 'm buying any raffle tickets . ###So really it is a case of swings and roundabouts . 
217706:29	###Well concessions ###Yes . 
217713:10	###The last play I worked out that w we had one four hundred and thirty seven of those thirty seven would be er freebies to the homes in , in to bring it down to about four hundred and on the ticket money we took in , I would say about a hundred and twenty of those were erm er concessions . ###How many over the year , roughly ? 
217714:11	###How many over the year , roughly ? ###I would have to guess at the others because I did n't do erm sums on the other ones it was only on the last play but if it 's on the same sort of erm proportions , then I would say somewhere around thirty percent of the audience are concessions . 
217916:56	###I mean he 's in the auction when he should be with them writing the labels . ###Yeah . 
217916:105	###I mean he 's in the auction when he should be with them writing the labels . ###Yeah . 
217916:133	###I mean he 's in the auction when he should be with them writing the labels . ###Yeah . 
217926:22	###That 's no use . ###I know they were still judging after midnight and that 's no good really no good at all on a working week . 
217937:47	###I think it works better . ###Yeah . 
217937:59	###I think it works better . ###Yeah . 
217937:80	###I think it works better . ###Yeah . 
217938:142	###Yeah . ###Yes of course yeah , but the , you know , we , we have to , I have to make a report and I have to recommend so I 'm recommending that we forget about the three-way stuff . 
217938:183	###Yeah . ###Yes of course yeah , but the , you know , we , we have to , I have to make a report and I have to recommend so I 'm recommending that we forget about the three-way stuff . 
217939:15	###Yes of course yeah , but the , you know , we , we have to , I have to make a report and I have to recommend so I 'm recommending that we forget about the three-way stuff . ###Er , we had a breeders ' meeting in October which was I enjoy them very much , I enjoy the the talk because it 's the first chance I get during the year when I can sit down and listen and I do n't have to worry about them generally , in another club , I do n't have to worry about minutes or anything , I just sit and listen and it 's great it , I really enjoy that . 
217946:223	###It 's very difficult to ###nine there 's nothing , you know they 'll get discouraged . 
217947:137	###nine there 's nothing , you know they 'll get discouraged . ###So you John now Jonathan he 's only fifteen , I know he looks in his twenties , but he 's only fifteen and he 's done a lot of homework so it makes him late and it makes him uncomfortable and he 's fidgety because he knows he 's got to disturb us when he goes out , he does n't does n't enjoy disturbing us , so I have to make that clear to you . 
217956:28	###That 's right and we , Brian had the club slides which he very kindly handed over to us when he , he , he felt it became difficult for him to cope with it erm cos his dad 's not well . ###So I always try to do that but I , I , again I find that it 's very erm very tiring and it 's very , gets very can get very involved with it , so I would like us , I 'd like you to think of the idea of a social secretary to help with the raffles and organizing what 's going on at the meetings please . 
217969:114	###Er we started off with seven hundred and seventy five pounds , seventy six , at the beginning of the year er the membership is only thirty seven , we have fewer members but er that 's a very small proportion of our income . ###Four pound for visitors only seem to come and then disappear not many of them seem to join us . 
218002:23	###Eighteen pounds . ###so we decided to join that for this year . 
218002:115	###Eighteen pounds . ###so we decided to join that for this year . 
218022:120	###Well as I say I mean we 're doing very well and all the money and , and you know , ninety percent of the money comes out of the the er the members ' pockets really I mean ev even the sub for the open show , we put out a lot of that even the stuff and things like this , so we do provide an awful lot of money . ###Er we have n't used very much of it this year I mean I think er I mentioned a few weeks ago the , the question of trips out perhaps in the spring to do fish and that , we could consider er we do n't want to just go er accumulating money for the sake of it erm , we want to get some benefit out of the money we 've got . 
218027:35	###We do n't them . ###We do n't with thousand pound in his back pocket ca n't be bad . 
218032:64	###Trouble is ###building society , I do n't know they do it . 
218032:139	###Trouble is ###building society , I do n't know they do it . 
218036:25	###Well it 's a and stuff like that , I mean ###But I mean I 
218060:68	###We 're obviously obviously thinking along these lines ###Is there ? 
218082:22	###Ninth ###that was n't too bad . 
218143:39	###Well he , he appreciated at the previous table show on the sixth of October and that was a case when it was always you know , because Danny only told me on that night that he could come . ###Yeah . 
218156:54	###Thirty pence . ###Yeah well 
218223:7	###The second point of concern is about children 's services . ###We 've still got the Children Act coming through , I know that may appear a bit odd , but that Act was in fact in nineteen eighty nine , but it 's come through in a sense on an incremental basis , and it 's accepted by the Department of Health and er , the S S I , that indeed , and the Audit Commission , that there are elements in the present settlement for the Children Act . 
218226:54	###And finally , as you will know , there is a new Criminal Justice Act which will be coming through , there are new steps that are going to be taken about juvenile offenders . ###My view is , and it 's been all along , that that will put pressure on your budget rather than decrease it , because it will tend to emphasise high cost residential er , solution . 
218233:50	###If I could give you just two very quick examples of what I mean , there is a proposal to reduce boarding out payments . ###Now , in effect , that 's moving directly against the direction that we want to go in , we want to make greater use of domiciliary er , initiatives for young people , you have another paper on your agenda about teen care , which is showing what can be achieved with the most difficult youngsters . 
218237:41	###We 're trying to maintain people in the , their own , their own homes . ###We know that 's largely what they want , but we 're having possibly to move away from that . 
218239:18	###So I think these are issues that you 're going to have to consider very firmly . ###And the final thing before , from me , before Mr starts for you , I wanted to welcome the fact that for the first year , there is a recognition of demographic growth change for social services , and I think that is most important . 
218251:187	###So there 's no element in this in terms of a developing additional service , it 's simply channelling the funding of that service to the local authority , where previously it went to the D S S . ###Erm , paragraph four , I er , refers to the fact that this is very much a joint process . 
218255:49	###Erm , the financial elements I find complex , I 'm sure from discussions with various members , they equally find it complex , but the position is , that in the current year , you have been given access to a specific grant . ###That grant is ring fenced , it can only be spent on community care defined elements , it includes the recognition that as well as buying care for people , you are for the first time , er , assessing people 's needs . 
218257:67	###In the past , if somebody went to the Department of Social Security , they simply had to show that they did n't have the income to fund their place , and they then received Income Support . ###Nobody actually looked at them and said do you need the care that you 're getting , or the care that you 're accessing ? 
218316:87	###Either a self-referral or referred by the G P , or by a consultant , or by the hospital , or one or two other sources . ###We are required to assess them . 
218318:82	###We ca n't turn round and say , sorry we ca n't afford to assess you , there is a requirement that if somebody presents themselves , we have to assess their needs . ###If we have n't got sufficient staff in place to do that , there will be delay . 
218350:57	###Erm , the final point on the shortfall of funding is as I 'm , keep emphasising , forgive me for repeating this , this is going to be year two of a four year transition . ###If we get it wrong in year two , it will be even more wrong in year three , because the distribution is n't going to alter dramatically in our favour , so if there is under-funding in ninety four , ninety five that we manage , it will present itself as a larger problem in ninety five , six , and an even larger problem in ninety s six , seven , so that needs to be borne in mind . 
218389:28	###Well there 's training , is n't there , to give to them ? ###Well , just generally , we have n't restricted recruiting of care staff , in other words , unless we know there 's a decision been made about a residential establishment which there has n't been at present . 
218389:68	###Well there 's training , is n't there , to give to them ? ###Well , just generally , we have n't restricted recruiting of care staff , in other words , unless we know there 's a decision been made about a residential establishment which there has n't been at present . 
218395:70	###New staff in the main , have been connected with care in community , and you 've heard really Mr explain to you already what they 're doing . ###We got specific money , in other words , the government flagged up that in the first year , there were going to be infrastructure costs , and so there was a specific allowance made for that , and we 've been recruiting gradually , not all at once , over a period of time , as the numbers of people coming into the community care system rise , we 've been recruiting new staff there . 
218396:89	###We got specific money , in other words , the government flagged up that in the first year , there were going to be infrastructure costs , and so there was a specific allowance made for that , and we 've been recruiting gradually , not all at once , over a period of time , as the numbers of people coming into the community care system rise , we 've been recruiting new staff there . ###Now , they 're of two sort , there are the administrative staff , the financial staff , in other words , that have to do the physical assessments er , financial assessments which by the way are more complicated now than they were previously , because there 's all sorts of different elements and agreements having to be reached with individuals , or charitable institutions or whatever . 
218396:129	###We got specific money , in other words , the government flagged up that in the first year , there were going to be infrastructure costs , and so there was a specific allowance made for that , and we 've been recruiting gradually , not all at once , over a period of time , as the numbers of people coming into the community care system rise , we 've been recruiting new staff there . ###Now , they 're of two sort , there are the administrative staff , the financial staff , in other words , that have to do the physical assessments er , financial assessments which by the way are more complicated now than they were previously , because there 's all sorts of different elements and agreements having to be reached with individuals , or charitable institutions or whatever . 
218405:11	###Lack of them . ###And that was the reason that the government brought in a new initiative after the Warner Report , and there 's a specific training grant that you now get to ensure that your training staff , your , your residential staff get trained . 
218413:127	###I 'd like to get Mr ###as you know with dint of great effort , got er , the er , scheme off the ground , which has taken a lot of , all of us a lot of hard work , er , and we 're proposing other schemes at Bexford House . 
218429:17	###Er , I 've seen other papers where there is a hint that we might be looking for a contribution , er , out of the general budget , er , of that difference , that two hundred and fifty thousand . ###We 're talking a lot of money here and I wonder whether we 're a little bit erm , over-optimistic that the five hundred thousand is going to be adequate . 
218503:79	###It 's substantially to do with registration of inspection duties arising from the Children Act , the registration and inspection of childminders , erm , workplace creches , and and Mike can go into detail on that if members wish . ###But er , it is an area where we are required to register and inspect , and unfortunately if we 're not happy on one these inspections , we are also required to , to pursue those , and ensure that there is improvement or cessation of the service . 
218518:30	###In one case in the community homes it says staff absence , and I 'm not clear what there is for training purposes , but I would hope that we are checking , or was this simply before Christmas , or what ? ###This Chair , has er , been a particularly difficult year with a , with a higher than average level of er , sickness , er amongst staff . 
218518:63	###In one case in the community homes it says staff absence , and I 'm not clear what there is for training purposes , but I would hope that we are checking , or was this simply before Christmas , or what ? ###This Chair , has er , been a particularly difficult year with a , with a higher than average level of er , sickness , er amongst staff . 
218519:123	###This Chair , has er , been a particularly difficult year with a , with a higher than average level of er , sickness , er amongst staff . ###Erm , the result er , was that we had to bring in relief staff , and other staff have had to work overtime . 
218536:112	###The position , Chair , if I can just quickly through you , say in terms of this budget , we do make a provision for absences , because obviously we do get sickness absence . ###Of course , 
218598:155	###The elderly population is based on the estimated increase in population of the over seventy five year olds , and indeed that is the factor that is now used in S S A in terms of looking er , the need to spend on elderly people . ###Er , it used to be those over eighty , but it 's been reduced to those over seventy five . 
218609:49	###So hence the inclusion of that one . ###A similar picture on European Social Fund which is falling out , erm , mainly relating to schemes for people with learning disability , and we have been very successful on that front in attracting European funding for learning disability , particularly those schemes which have an element of , of training for , for employment associated with them . 
218630:58	###Jean ? ###Well , er , we 're in an impossible situation are n't we ? 
218632:127	###I think everyone 's accepted that fact , er , at the end of the day , someone has got to make some very , very bad decisions . ###Erm , we ca n't just ignore the responsibilities that we 've been given . 
218659:12	###That rather than making a block grant for somebody because we know they do a good job , that we do more directly relate that to services they 're providing to us and output . ###Needless to say voluntary bodies are very nervous about that , because they have difficulty contracting to provide a service when they are totally dependent on unpaid volunteers , and therefore there is reluctance on their part to , to enter into contracts that bind them to provide something where they are uncertain about their ability to do it . 
218671:8	###Ellands ###elderly persons homes , I think , and we 're looking at two sets in that , er , there 's the proposal at twenty two , for a closure of one residential home for the elderly , in the east of the county . 
218674:64	###Er , and then the further closure depending where the line is drawn , the further potential closure of an additional home , which is the one that er , Mr made reference to . ###Erm , now we , we can explain to you in more detail , but the finan I think Mr ' s already said to you that the financial savings er , from such moves are not as productive as they were , so in sense we 're driven by strategy here , we 're driven by the fact that there is a private and there is an independent sector that is there , there is alternative methods of supply . 
218687:69	###Right , can you tell how you 're intending to er , administer the hundred and fifty thousand pounds home care services ? ###How 's that going to be er , implemented ? 
218689:17	###Are you going to , when you do your care packages say we can only award so much , we 'll have to reduce it , arbitrarily ? ###Yes , yes , yes 
218696:9	###It 's a military term ###To fill that gap for us immediately . 
218741:15	###Somebody 's shaking their head . ###C we 've , I mean we 've , we are having discussions , er , with the health authority about the way in which they propose to deal with their good fortune this year . 
218752:129	###And the choice is actually for us to forego the use of those , a much needed use in some instances , in order to get a net income as an alternative to cutting services elsewhere . ###Did you want some , some formal in relation to the consultation ? 
218759:49	###Be advised by Mr . ###The Chair is obviously referring to the fact recently in the courts , there was consideration of the closure of old persons ' homes , and you know that you are under a legal requirement to consult in respect of those otherwise any decision , to close without consultation can held to be invalid , and that has impinged on some authorities who were going down that route , so there is a duty there . 
218761:96	###There is a specific statutory provision scattered about , children 's services particularly , where children have to be consulted . ###Erm , so on that , on major services , it is incumbent upon you to consult , erm , and detailed advice is given by me to the Director in relation to each of the , of the er , proposals as to when and how consultation should take place . 
218762:56	###Erm , so on that , on major services , it is incumbent upon you to consult , erm , and detailed advice is given by me to the Director in relation to each of the , of the er , proposals as to when and how consultation should take place . ###But , in some of the major ones , the children and the elderly , there are quite clearly on the statutes laid down , and case law , laid down saying you must go through a process of consultation . 
218790:12	###So do I ###I think it 's very good policy , there 's many people policy , who are in our homes , who would give anything to have been able to have stayed in their own homes , or maybe stayed with relatives , but erm , they need the help and care in their homes . 
218793:24	###It is n't anything to do with government at all . ###Order , order 
218806:56	###There 's no doubt about that . ###We er , er , had all these homes , they sprung up , and what they 've decided is , that is n't the way to go forward from here on in , what we 're going to do , er , we 're gonna have what 's called care in the community . 
218818:143	###I do n't know whether this will be acceptable to Policy and Resources Committee or the Council at the end of the day , but essentially what is showing there is something that , taken over the three years meets er , a figure equivalent to the annual but it does n't do it uniformly over the three years . ###And that 's something I think members need to bear in mind . 
218821:10	###I 'm not proposing that to you at the moment Chairman , I 'm just pointing it out to members so that there 's no confusion on it . ###And then , on the bottom of page sixteen and through on to seventeen is addressing the point that , also within the guideline , we have been asked , we 've been asked as a Committee , to look at the implications of finding up to a further two hundred and fifty thousand pounds ' worth of reductions . 
218849:9	###Er , we know that there 's an O and M report coming through , we 've got a pretty good idea what 's in it . ###We know that there 's a thing called the Warner Report , which is er , leaning all the way for more er , and yet we will reducing . 
218850:27	###We know that there 's a thing called the Warner Report , which is er , leaning all the way for more er , and yet we will reducing . ###So I have to say to you that whilst I 'm putting these forward , it 's absolutely clear that we would be having adverse comments and criticism er , from the S S I , and that you would be moving into areas that I ca n't recommend to you , but I , I put them forward as obviously illustrations . 
218852:14	###Chair , I , I think we have to reflect that view to the P and R Committee . ###I mean we all know it , and we all know there 's a lot on this list which are most unpalatable , and they 're only there because we 've been set the task of reaching a particular sum of money , and er , if we had the choice we 'd be going in the reverse direction , and , and adding . 
218867:49	###It 's not fair , that 's right ###So you 're just arguing about Shropshire 's allocation , it 's got nothing to do with government policy affairs , about holding Cou local government spending er , within limits , you 're not saying that . 
218933:65	###Is that agreed ? ###Yes . 
218971:132	###There was a strong feeling in some quarters , especially the voluntary sector , but also the District Council , that questions the degree of representation of all the different interests needed to be looked at , hence the proposal that there should be ###Below that level , colleagues , thirdly , and you may be less interested in this , erm , but the , because this is very much at the level of , of officers , at least from the statutory bodies . 
218987:8	###But it does , this is a the er , comment . ###Er , Professor did say final words of aspiration , and I sha n't talk on aspirations , I was interested in it , and although I talked the empirical linguis linguisism . 
219008:173	###Erm , on the grounds that the substance he was dealing with was complicated , and I think , erm , colleague is right to reprove me for some of the language . ###But the plain fact is , and genuinely I mean this , er , er , erm , if it were as simple working across the boundaries between yourselves and the Health Authority , between yourselves and the private sector , with the voluntary sector , and the great army of unpaid helpers if it was that simple , erm , then we would have moved a long way along that line towards implementation of a humane and caring care in the community twenty years ago , when these debates first started . 
219079:7	###I think several , several references have been made to the importance of the agreement with the health authorities , and recognizing that the agreement is a joint process . ###It is a condition to us receiving the special transitional grant , and as we carried out last year , with drafting the agreement , we have a very short period of time in which to put the agreement together . 
219083:37	###The first one is the existing arrangements on nursing home care , really reviewing the process , and members will recognize that the arrangements that were agreed in the first agreement with Health Authority related to gaining permission from the Health Authority before our placing nursing homes . ###That has been re re reviewed through the year , and the process somewhat simplified , and now seems to be working well . 
219125:29	###Chairman , it is there for your information , I 'm not certain we 've got a representative of property funding , but try and deal with any comments as they come up . ###Just mention Chair , that there 
219172:110	###Helpful , ###Yes , yes , er , we go into item seven , er , marked H , I think it 's residential nursing home . 
219183:7	###or whatever . ###And er , they ca n't just close the doors and put a notice in the window . 
219183:222	###or whatever . ###And er , they ca n't just close the doors and put a notice in the window . 
219214:30	###Can we move on then to the Social , Social Care Enterprise Agency , marked K . ###Chairman , can we have your guidance on this , we have a report and we have a short video , by which I do mean a short video , do you wish to see the video , or do you wish to deal directly with the report ? 
219317:165	###Sorry , I 've picked it up , sorry about that . ###That figure has referred to preventative services . 
219328:56	###Erm , without stigmatizing them , it is possible to identify families where any new addition to the family or youngster coming into it , obviously are children who need erm , extra backup in one form or another , before they reach school age . ###These are the ones I am particularly anxious about at the moment , erm , now I 've put down four different headings on this particular way that I think we could help , erm , and hopefully , if there 's two hundred perhaps you 'd tell me whether there 's two hundred thousand is aimed at perhaps some of it , in , in this direction or not , I do n't know ? 
219365:122	###We currently have twenty nine youngsters erm , in places , erm , with a potential to offer forty three places , and erm , we are continuing to develop the scheme quite successfully . ###Chair , I want to say , it , it is a success , and er , that it 's important to show you how diversion can work . 
219380:22	###It 's not always possible for the teen care people to actually erm , have that expertise if you like . ###In other words , they ca n't go out themselves , perhaps rock climbing , they may have a lot of other attributes , but they have n't that particular attribute . 
219403:80	###No ###In fact we 've had an underwhelming response , I think at this present minute , and so could I put out the er , request again to members er , to consider coming to this seminar . 
219427:56	###members to members , and not perhaps for officers to interfere too much other than to give you background information , and it has been falling off , let me just say that . ###Mrs , next 
219434:67	###It 's quite a bit to do on one day , to go and do four . ###That 's the sort of issue Chair , that we shall be able to address on the twenty seventh . 
219513:97	###I also understand from meetings , I 'm meeting a group of social workers as I call them , that are dealing with the people with learning difficulties , erm , these are at present taking place in the Castle Hall . ###This I do know is not , is not at this place successful , not for people concerned with the , the facilities are not really adequate , and I understand that they also would be hoping to take advantage of this community centre . 
219598:157	###We make it . ###Are they ? 
219602:63	###But Chairman , that refers to item three two , not the whole of three ###Yes , but I mean , it , it is erm , 
219616:47	###Yes , there seems to be some database with what we 're ###We ca n't , 
219740:12	###It 's difficult as far as the alternatives are concerned , is that no alternatives , but effectively it 's about four times the cost to administer , because you can dip a hundred sheep off one of the er , packs and it 's a smaller pack . ###So it 's far more expensive and it does n't do anything against fly strike during the summer . 
219740:45	###It 's difficult as far as the alternatives are concerned , is that no alternatives , but effectively it 's about four times the cost to administer , because you can dip a hundred sheep off one of the er , packs and it 's a smaller pack . ###So it 's far more expensive and it does n't do anything against fly strike during the summer . 
219753:43	###This is a , a it 's the same as can be used against weevil fly . ###It , it seems to be very fairly effective , or very effective , but not a hundred percent effective , as the organo-phospho type , and you need to inject . 
219761:10	###Ten days , fourteen days whatever it might be . ###And we found that about twenty two percent of the er , sheep being entered , had been dipped within the period , so in other words they 'd not been withheld , so it 's a concern . 
219761:29	###Ten days , fourteen days whatever it might be . ###And we found that about twenty two percent of the er , sheep being entered , had been dipped within the period , so in other words they 'd not been withheld , so it 's a concern . 
219761:64	###Ten days , fourteen days whatever it might be . ###And we found that about twenty two percent of the er , sheep being entered , had been dipped within the period , so in other words they 'd not been withheld , so it 's a concern . 
219771:12	###Rather than the last meeting , it was just a couple of days after the last meeting , so rather than wait until now , I circulated all the papers I 'd got . ###I think Chairman , it is of particular interest of Shropshire is n't it really ? 
219851:9	###And in the past , the , the nearest we 've got to that is taking them along to a fire station and telling them what sort of people we are , that has been proved in many cases to be counterproductive , because it 's actually an incentive if you wish to set fires from other districts than this . ###So what we 're trying to do is approach this in a professional way , and we 're drawing on the national and the international experience and working together with Social Services to try and determine a sensible policy . 
219854:29	###So we 're at that very early stage that we are working directly with Social Services , and also in another area with education , for the same reason . ###Is it , er , er , having an impact on us , on our standing ? 
219901:7	###Yes ###Oh , your computer played up , yes , yes , George 
219924:32	###The plane crashed completely . ###Erm , I would like to particularly compliment the Fire Service on the magnificent job they were doing there , in , in the most appalling conditions . 
219924:48	###The plane crashed completely . ###Erm , I would like to particularly compliment the Fire Service on the magnificent job they were doing there , in , in the most appalling conditions . 
219929:183	###Because it 's absolutely disgraceful . ###I mean it was a very big operation , there could have been people alive in that plane , but er , as it happened , I , I think tragically they were both dead , but I mean , but people did n't know that . 
219987:241	###We erm , we have some photographs of w which are rather horrendous actually , of R T As . ###Now , I 've discussed with the Chief Fire Officer whether members of this Committee should be allowed to look at them . 
220073:139	###It 's very difficult to analyze that using manual systems . ###Erm , so looking though it , the , the kind of , the only really important points , I think are that , er , to carry out statutory and non-statutory work . 
220074:29	###Erm , so looking though it , the , the kind of , the only really important points , I think are that , er , to carry out statutory and non-statutory work . ###Most of non-statutory work is giving advice to people like control , and others , which may not be purely statutory in the sense that is , but the major difference is there 's a time when it 's imposed on when we have to do it . 
220115:37	###Oh indeed , I mean a great many of them we have no responsibility at all for , we merely give advice when requested . ###The Health and Safety at Work Act , that 's one line with nothing decided , that covers a vast array of tenants and individuals and regulations . 
220120:46	###Well , registration of children 's homes . ###We give advice on suitable tenders , it 's not up to us to make sure that they 're enforced . 
220140:89	###Councillor ? ###I 'll , I was just going to say , Chairman , I , I too am very concerned really about the number of premises where it is advisory to the District Councils , or advisory to . 
220165:48	###And ca n't you keep it , keep the Fire Officer when the home 's licence er , if they do n't carry out statutory duties as required ? ###We , we , we , I suppose it 'd be like two levels , that in the majority of cases we could say we recommend that you do not issue a licence . 
220167:101	###Social Services are really a help , we could choose to ignore that , I have to say that I 'm not aware of that happening , and I think it 's very unlikely . ###Because it would be a very dangerous thing for someone to do . 
220173:13	###Is this , all these wonderful protection of animals , dogs and horses and so on , and pet shops and so on , do , does the Chief Fire Officer think in his local knowledge , that most of these have been inspected by his officers , or does he get the feeling there , that sometimes the district councils are not asking for these inspections ? ###It varies a great deal depending on the district council . 
220195:45	###Hotels which were in the first days of making order , and factories which came from the old Factories Act . ###And the cost , or the potential cost of designating particular , like hospitals and similar premises is so prohibitive that the government has chosen never to implement the designating orders for them . 
220211:86	###They have now been varied slightly but they make very little difference . ###A question that 's already been asked of me , on appendix C , up at employee at the largest single figure there is a hundred and thirty seven thousand eight hundred . 
220355:31	###In spite of a lack of er , sort of er , carol sheets for , for some of us , it really was , as you say , a very enjoyable evening , and I was particularly erm , keen on the , the introduction of Saint Nicolas , and it certainly got smaller children , I think it was er , fantastic , and I certainly have n't enjoyed so er , I 'll be back ###We diddled them out of er , Christmas presents which , which surprised me . 
220361:160	###Chairman , she did it er , erm , very nicely , from the local ###That 's right , that 's right . 
220400:18	###Will they listen to him , I hope . ###You 're next authority . 
220400:51	###Will they listen to him , I hope . ###You 're next authority . 
220419:60	###I hope you 've all read it . ###Yes 
220422:59	###Pardon ? ###Pardon ? 
220521:87	###Can I make an observation Mr Chairman , will you take observations as well ? ###Yes , I 'll take observat why , wait a minute . 
220522:33	###Yes , I 'll take observat why , wait a minute . ###Yes , erm , on paragraph three erm , the , the last sentence erm , where it says without direct access to its own balances , the authority may therefore have to make revised precept in ninety four , ninety five erm , I understand what 's being said there , but any organization needs to actually work within er , a clearly defined budget . 
220585:86	###The problem is as Mr has said , if that is expected to be replicated across future years , this would represent a ten percent reduction in the statutory service , er , which is only partly under control of this Committee , with mixed responsibilities with the Registrar General . ###Seventy percent of the expenditure is on staff who you do not employ and cannot dismiss , a large part of the income , or all the income is through the fees that are set na nationally by the government . 
220585:126	###The problem is as Mr has said , if that is expected to be replicated across future years , this would represent a ten percent reduction in the statutory service , er , which is only partly under control of this Committee , with mixed responsibilities with the Registrar General . ###Seventy percent of the expenditure is on staff who you do not employ and cannot dismiss , a large part of the income , or all the income is through the fees that are set na nationally by the government . 
220607:52	###A couple of comments on that Chair , the first one , on the reduction in carry forwards , my understanding is that , in fact it 's quite amusing in some ways , because this , this is something I was accused of as Chair of Resources Management during my year . ###Er , what in fact this Committee is doing , is saying that at one of the sections that makes up part of it , you happen to have carry forwards spare from last year , therefore use them because we ca n't identify anything else in budget savings for this , next year . 
220608:92	###Er , what in fact this Committee is doing , is saying that at one of the sections that makes up part of it , you happen to have carry forwards spare from last year , therefore use them because we ca n't identify anything else in budget savings for this , next year . ###Erm , that is n't necessarily the same as saying by the way your section will have to repeat that saving in future years . 
220629:63	###Things like false alarm calls and so on , have been through the courts and we 've been stopped from doing that . ###We charge the highest rate in the country for issuing fire certificates which is one of the few things which we 're actually allowed to charge , and we charge more than virtually any other authority in this country .

220667:10	###So we put a , as a rider on , that it had already passed the rider it says there , but we found it unacceptable at P A G . ###for we 're offering them 
220701:10	###survived this far . ###Right last Friday we went through the four stages of selling . 
220712:195	###For the second part finding out what their needs are . ###That really is I think er the part that I erm are most useful in those . 
220739:44	###It will ###try and close . 
220876:181	###So if I was to say we 've we 've picked our area , what potential instructions do we have do you think , let 's say we 've got a good , quite now , what potential instruction do we have with that particular area , that arena rather ? ###T V . 
220920:69	###Very few people at all would ever ever ever ever say that and we look at the , when we look at the , the erm format you 'll find called it a sadist because chains on him from because on him so that we . ###However , if you feel the buyer 's going to present a business problem we show them the buyer 's guide and a business card so you can give them the buyer 's guide , explain what it 's for and then give them your business card and then that buyer 's guide to look for business card . 
220938:49	###Oh yeah we 've ###carry on . 
220950:7	###Yeah . ###but hopefully it wo n't be the so what you 're saying was you you 'd recommend it to us , yeah plan this is the way we do our business , by recommendations okay . 
221001:48	###The final session would be to introduce er the C C Q . ###That 's basically , that is step one can you follow ? 
221014:80	###Now acknowledgement could be , can be . ###That 's a good question the temptation to fill the void is quite intense . 
221018:50	###ten . ###Specially fifth , a fifth of a second and they start to feel uncomfortable . 
221039:112	###Bit long winded C C Q then put your back up . ###to say okay and then quite often you say my God that 's that whopper . 
221042:7	###People buy in three different modes , visual and audible or a connective touchy , feel mode , if he wants to be touchy feeling you give it to him . ###He 'll be touchy feeling and he wants to complete application form , give it to him okay if he 's an original he 'll want to see conceptual presentations , he 'll want to see illustrations , he 'll want to see erm , sales aids , if he 's in audible mode he will far more readily to what you tell him as opposed to , let me show you something , okay and there 's a specific technique 
221051:122	###So er right loads of you have been away , I 'm going to hand ###And you can use this when we move into the role play 
221074:33	###In the following two appointments our client 's wife was unable to attend , however , it 's important that all decision makers should be present where possible . ###Step one the open , this looks at the introduction and the purpose of the appointment . 
221095:112	###What that means in your particular groups you will nominate amongst yourselves who will be the fourth role play . ###So each of the groups four role plays amongst yourselves who will do er the extra role play . 
221095:142	###What that means in your particular groups you will nominate amongst yourselves who will be the fourth role play . ###So each of the groups four role plays amongst yourselves who will do er the extra role play . 
221100:104	###Right here feedback to your respective manager as regards to your sales figures so please stick to that format for today and tomorrow everyone clear on what we have for today , yeah ? . ###So we 're looking at five minutes preparation , fifteen minutes role play , fifteen minutes play back , followed by twenty minutes feedback . 
221101:27	###So we 're looking at five minutes preparation , fifteen minutes role play , fifteen minutes play back , followed by twenty minutes feedback . ###Each cycle should take fifty five minutes so we do three sets of role play , well we look at them , look for the cycle to start at quarter past ten first cycle must start at quarter past ten , there four that should be for one o' clock so we commence the third and final role play , come back here and break for lunch and have an hour for lunch final role play at two o' clock . 
221254:11	###It was preparation that did it ###was n't the preparation , but yours was the best , best one of Friday 
221286:42	###Right ###Means you 're gonna live in a field . 
221334:39	###Right which is your tape ? ###Have you just left that running ? 
221438:7	###Is that your business card ? ###picked up . 
221443:23	###Got a second tomorrow , so that 's seven the whole bit the whole week is all about that until we get to the presentation presentations , what does he mean by presentations ? ###I do n't know . 
221498:46	###Hard task master . ###Apparently there was a woman A B M at our branch until recently and apparently she was very good too . 
221621:30	###Alright then . ###But , but you ca can see what I 'm trying to get at . 
221671:33	###Why I had too much . ###Oh no , just keep calm , that 's all . 
221694:66	###You 've got to join . ###Oh yes you come in , it 's , it 's not a membership , you just go along and pay your fees and . 
221730:101	###Okay how we 're going , how have we attempted to deliver the goods to the population at large ? ###As you can see , so far six hundred organizations have registered with us and what we 've done is put them in a rather , rather flash booklet and the idea is that youngsters , their parents , teachers , youth leaders , scout leaders , anybody , gets hold of one of these booklets and in it , it tells them how to go sailing . 
221743:105	###Cos that 's the important thing I think . ###So often we at the National Authority seen to be selling something which may or may not be you and the clubs er and the Class Associations round the country thinks important . 
221782:10	###Sponsorship should of course be the icing on the cake , there should be enough in , in competition in regattas and themselves but people are interested enough to go and to support and that sponsorship actually allows you to do things that you would n't have been able to do otherwise . ###The danger of course is that sponsorship for itself , in itself becomes more important than the actual regattas . 
221811:7	###Our President has covered one or two major issues that concern us now and which will continue to concern us over the next few years . ###I can only emphasise the point that Her Royal Highness has already made on the requirements for us to have a much larger membership to allow us to speak with strong voice in the many debates we find ourselves involved on behalf of our sport whether it be windsurfers , dinghies , offshore sailing craft , motor cruisers , powerboat racing , anything that virtually goes on the water we look after . 
221813:36	###This must be the major object of the Association during my chairmanship is to increase our individual membership which we need so much to re to our representation at a high level . ###Her Royal Highness has also highlighted the R Y A year of youth sailing which she launched at the Earls Court Boat Show . 
221814:31	###Her Royal Highness has also highlighted the R Y A year of youth sailing which she launched at the Earls Court Boat Show . ###The youngsters are our sea call of the future and we must grasp the initiative with both hands . 
221818:7	###Our sport is for all this is not a slick statement of jargon but a fact , thanks to our boats sailors of all ages and all eligibilities can participate . ###Many people never race , just enjoy themselves pottering . 
221819:115	###Many people never race , just enjoy themselves pottering . ###We must look after not all of the sport , the high flyers , the starters , the beginners and those who just go out for enjoyment and potter . 
221860:16	###If there was a resolution on the agenda today to increase the subscription , and I hasten to add there is n't , but if there was then that increase by convention would take effect on the first of January nineteen ninety four but the full value of the increase would not reach our income and expenditure account until the year nineteen ninety five to ninety six and this means that we are not well placed to respond to short-term financial problems . ###However , the major problem , and you Ma ' am have already touched upon this as well as the Chairman and I am sorry to be repetitive but we do serve all yachtsmen , two and a half to three million of them whilst being financially supported by only sixty five thousand of them . 
221862:17	###The only satisfactory long-term solution must be to secure a hugely increased membership of the Association . ###The R Y A does n't need an enormous subscription income and so if we could increase personal membership to say four hundred and eighty thousand , which happens to be the aggregate membership of our member clubs , this could be at a very much lower individual subscription and this in turn would facilitate selling membership to the nearly two million yachts persons who are not members of clubs . 
221866:43	###Coming back to reality Ma ' am and the balance sheet . ###The R Y A is financially strong , following from the good results of last year , the reserves passed one million pounds for the first time and those will enable us to continue with our work for yachting while we deal with the problems that I have touched upon . 
221882:68	###As you realize six hundred clubs , the chances of my getting round all of them , ha ###five hundred . 
221957:8	###Right my item ten of course is Any Other Business . ###Is there any other business ? 
221957:20	###Right my item ten of course is Any Other Business . ###Is there any other business ? 
221989:64	###All these people that tear about on the water on a Sunday do n't know what they 're doing and are in desperate need of someone to manage them . ###I have , however , pointed out that there are things like nautical charts , voyage systems , harbour regulations etcetera etcetera which is a form of management albeit self management . 
221997:98	###Now if that is really saying to the water users that it 's down to you , there are genuine concerns of conservation and I think they are , there is a real problem in some areas . ###The important thing is for people to listen to the genuine concerns , sort out the , the real issues from the power politics and then hopefully go forward in , in a , in a manner of conciliation . 
221999:51	###Perhaps in closing erm I would just er repeat with your permission Ma ' am er a piece from your nineteen ninety er presidential address and it says , as yachtsmen we must care for the environment , it is fair to say that most do but images are created by the bad news . ###People who have grown up with the sport when the pressures were not too great perhaps do not always think of others . 
222072:116	###Right , so exactly what are you wearing ? ###Well if you take this I 'll explain . 
222103:19	###There are a few knots that we need to learn when we 're sailing . ###This particular one is called a rail turn and two half hitches it needs to be tight so that it does n't come undone when we 're out there . 
222128:71	###This other cleat is for adjusting the out-haul , we 'll come on to that in a moment . ###To attach the sail to the boom we have two clips , one simply holds the sail down to the boom , whilst the other one , the out-haul is used to bury the tension on the foot of the sail . 
222175:89	###Sailing along at forty five degrees to the wind the sail is in tightly and it needs constant adjustment on the tiller to stay on that right course because the wind is never totally steady . ###Keep a look out for where you are going and watch the luff of the sail . 
222192:71	###What we need to look at though is how we change course if that means moving the position of the sail across the boat . ###Here we 're sailing downwind and we want to turn left effectively , so that means moving the sail across the boat without changing the course of the boat too much . 
222196:47	###Again , change hands , push the tiller to where you were sitting , watch for the boom , as it swings across , straighten up and sit down on the new side . ###In stronger winds the manoeuvre becomes a bit more lively and here it 's a good idea to twig the mainsheet to help the boom come across . 
222206:80	###Daggerboard position , get the right compromise between drive and drag course wave good , the shortest or fastest distance between two points . ###Sail trim is n't simply a question of pulling everything in and forgetting about it as the sail works at its maximum at any one angle to the wind . 
222245:35	###As the boat picks up speed , so you can settle gently into the boat to gain control . ###That 's it , you 're away into deep water and sailing happily . 
222259:67	###Then as before , step out to the shallow water , lift out the daggerboard , raise the rudder completely and lift the boat ashore . ###Now we 've covered the basic techniques of sailing , the best way of putting them into practice is by sailing round the triangular course and so I 've laid out these three marks . 
222275:18	###Should Suzanne have let the sail out like that ? ###No , by letting the sheet go she lost power . 
222316:8	###Now the accent is on patience . ###Just think of the resistance to the sail dragging through the water . 
222345:7	###Well it 's always better to reef ashore if you can but if you do get caught out you can reef afloat just the same . ###I remember the time I was out there struggling in a strong wind , the boat was definitely overpowered . 
222394:28	###Well sailing is what you want it to be . ###For some of us it 's pitting our strength against the elements , for others it 's pitting our wits against other people by going racing and yet other people seek adventure by exploring new sailing areas and the beauty of a small sail boat like the Topper is that you can do all of these . 
222397:36	###That means looking up the tide tables to see the times of high and low water and the tidal stream list to find the maximum rates . ###In tide free waters like the Mediterranean we do n't have the same problem but we still need to consult a chart to find out a suitable location for sailing . 
222465:27	###Yes perhaps you 're right Fred . ###Well we do n't have a definite answer erm Gill but we think it may have experienced a shock of some sort during that season and of course when this happens to fruit trees they can go into bi-annual cropping and then they come back again , it may be that this horse chestnut 's experienced something very similar . 
222549:7	###I 'm wondering if , if it 's too acid for a good crop of potatoes without liming . ###Yes it certainly is , I , as you say the streets round Sally Oak are lined with erm gardens with rhododendrons in are n't they ? 
222567:40	###erm what do you think Fred , dormice ? ###I think , oh I think the holes are a bit big are n't they for a dormouse ? 
222601:70	###And very swiftly from that I 'm going to I 'm going to move to your part of the world Fred , I 'm going to go to Preston in Lancashire . ###Erm Mrs Lynne who 's got a well established peach tree which is in an old greenhouse , I should think that 's the best place for it in Lancashire in , in the shelter of a greenhouse . 
222601:86	###And very swiftly from that I 'm going to I 'm going to move to your part of the world Fred , I 'm going to go to Preston in Lancashire . ###Erm Mrs Lynne who 's got a well established peach tree which is in an old greenhouse , I should think that 's the best place for it in Lancashire in , in the shelter of a greenhouse . 
222635:22	###What you think , what you do n't want is things that spread very widely . ###Erm Walter what about you for two shrub roses ? 
222641:10	###And you can use it in pot pourri as well ca n't you Stefan ? ###You can indeed Daphne , so there you are Rosemary do plant some shrub roses and even if you have n't got room for all of our suggestions I hope you 'll find room for two or three of them . 
222648:38	###Well the flowering house plants , we hope you 're going to be given for Christmas , things like cyclamen and indoor azaleas and also your indoor bowls of course will last much longer if you give them the coolest , lightest position you can . ###Warm central heating is bad news for indoor plants . 
222716:91	###and then you do a division of the one into the other and you get a figure that is smaller in the tabloids and larger in broadsheets like The Times and The Financial Times and in periodicals like the Communist and the New Statesman . ###Over the last twenty years or so , one of the things that 's slipped has been those kind of things and I believe and Peter may disagree with me , but a lot of the have been because of the commercial fact that the thing that is now driving the newspapers more than anything else is , is the advertising and advertising revenues and that drives the style of newspapers and stories that are written . 
222742:228	###Oh ###I think I am right in saying . 
222869:14	###How does the Sun do it ? ###Close to tears and her voice quaking with emotion 
222870:7	###Close to tears and her voice quaking with emotion ###Excuse me I have to say Princess Diana yesterday stunned the world announcing that she is to quit public life . 
222883:147	###Thank you Chairman . ###Now on the . 
222884:16	###Now on the . ###Chairman , thank , thank you very much indeed erm Chairman , I will in fact and er perhaps if I read that in the first instance I have n't circulated it erm if I read that the first instance it will set the of what I have to say . 
222908:119	###Erm I do n't think that as a committee that we should be getting into the detail necessary of what 's going wrong and I think er Harold made that quite well . ###Now the implication of that is that the tide flaps and the sluices er will operate it slightly less frequently in ten years . 
223040:10	###Thank you Chairman . ###I 've forgotten my new year 's resolution which is to use christian names . 
223055:107	###That 's point one erm point two on the planning application fees I realize that a number of planning applications are down somewhere else erm it says that planning application fees are going to be increased by fifteen percent and there by thirteen percent . ###Is that 
223083:17	###Who 's going to do it ? ###I 'll try first yes if I may . 
223083:55	###Who 's going to do it ? ###I 'll try first yes if I may . 
223083:76	###Who 's going to do it ? ###I 'll try first yes if I may . 
223086:120	###The problem however is there 's , there is no standard fee per application and er I think that that 's not at all unreasonable . ###The fee there is according to the size and scale of development . 
223113:7	###Can we very good . ###that one uses today has a connotation of 
223150:64	###Er we had a very good example of that in application sub the other day with where I 'm sure it was very helpful to have that input and there is considerable respect paid for the patch view in planning in my experience and I think that 's very healthy . ###I can only hope that when the system has changed , that the man in Guildford will listen to the patch . 
223161:44	###Can I just congratulate er the County Planning Officer on operating in an oasis o of , of if I can put it that way . ###Erm good one thank you report to the Highways Committee complaints I think he 's er perhaps remarkably lucky in operating this way and er i it 's er a great credit to the department in terms of 
223164:175	###Well , you 've heard what the members say and er let us hope that you continue in this very sensitive area and handle these er matters with er care and sensitivity . ###Can we move on can we move on to er general item A . 
223164:193	###Well , you 've heard what the members say and er let us hope that you continue in this very sensitive area and handle these er matters with er care and sensitivity . ###Can we move on can we move on to er general item A . 
223224:41	###So it 's nothing to do with by their own choice so I understand . ###It should be something this committee erm tends to 
223253:84	###There er erm other er matter that er erm I er wanted to mention erm if only to get the word sustainability on to the tape that is being recorded on the ###seems that one of th the key areas that we are looking at and er will incorporate in the structure plan is sustainability . 
223263:114	###Chairman I , yes I , I mean that I ###or attend 
223263:150	###Chairman I , yes I , I mean that I ###or attend 
223276:19	###Right so we note this report . ###Thank you . 
223276:84	###Right so we note this report . ###Thank you . 
223276:101	###Right so we note this report . ###Thank you . 
223288:9	###all to do with that one first ###Right , right , right . 
223303:46	###I , I , I take all the planning and what the officer is saying , but I mean do n't you think it makes more sense from our point of view than we realize . ###Ch Chairman I , I , I , I would agree with Mr that we might er successfully change the order , but we ca n't er and should n't make it a condition of issuing that statement of conformity that Aida have done those things . 
223334:77	###I mean yes er as I said earlier on it 's just a question for for just a bit more obviously in the readings report th there is there is concern naturally with the by-passes in paragraph two five I mean I have n't had a chance to sort of looking up yet , and I 'd by grateful for County Executive 's advice on that and I thought we as a County Council had agreed a line erm for a by-pass through the West Sussex portion at least . ###So 
223405:185	###I 've just read the enquiry and the public dealing with these issues and the D O E has rejected rentable housing as a solution to affordable housing . ###I think I 'm right in saying that . 
223410:10	###He is over in Lewes unfortunately , but he did offer so to do , er which I think would you know put you in a more informed position to pursue the matter with this committee . ###I shall certainly do what I can to advance the matter , but I hesitate to say what about the paper , because I do n't think it is an easy thing to cover in a paper . 
223419:7	###So I think you know it is a subject that we should , probably should go on to , to discuss it in more detail , but I 'm really concerned because I think the policies government authorities were even accepting . ###I 'm not gonna ask for the problems of the homeless people that we 've got in this country . 
223426:150	###So I understand it will encourage others and there are some very wealthy landowners for whom this may not be a great strain on their resources . ###Erm sorry , thank you Chairman . 
223440:21	###Er ###time yes . 
223461:29	###Six . ###Six and moving it to the afternoon yes , it 's er a nice question . 
223465:7	###Now part two . ###Can we approve that , is there any problem at all ? 
223474:168	###So we accept that Thank you very much and I 'm grateful to you , I 'm sorry I 've gone but it was that general question rightly raised by ###Erm , coming onto the other issues I wish to raise . 
223488:12	###Mrs next and then Mr . ###Mr Chairman , erm , I 'll keep my comments slightly . 
223508:33	###Erm , to some extent I , I , I what was saying . ###I 'm sorry to see that although we 've got a large increase in budget , which is of course always very welcome , that we have n't perhaps addressed improving the quality er as much as we might have done , although we 've got a lot more home help hours that may be classed as an improvement , but er there are many other areas where we could perhaps encourage improvement in community care er with a bit of thought . 
223513:15	###Have we got sufficient er leeway there ? ###Under the erm of page three where we have that I assume can be solely used for residential and nursing home care , wo n't be used for anything else take it back . 
223594:47	###And I suppose he that 's an area where one is worried about quantity and quality because it 's in a way you can always provide more quantity I imagine at a lesser cost by going into a conurbation than you can by going into rural areas . ###I think it 's very important that we do n't neglect er people who live in rural areas and that we do in fact ensure that they get the same sort of provision erm that they do elsewhere . 
223595:63	###I think it 's very important that we do n't neglect er people who live in rural areas and that we do in fact ensure that they get the same sort of provision erm that they do elsewhere . ###So you know just picking up Mr ' s point , I h we must n't confuse , I mean I agree that quantity is one of the measures of quality but it 's not the only one . 
223596:116	###So you know just picking up Mr ' s point , I h we must n't confuse , I mean I agree that quantity is one of the measures of quality but it 's not the only one . ###You , you can put more resources into things and not necessarily provide something better so I think that one has to try and do the two together . 
223609:33	###There are one or two things that do bother me . ###I am very pleased for instance that the unit is to be opened at and I would like to know if there are any other places in mind for disabled problems . 
223690:20	###in fact that would be catered for by other provisions because erm under the directive on choice , any individual has a right to er say that they would like to go to a particular home . ###We w er we would , we would only need to pay for them at the rate where they lived . 
223695:176	###The erm safety on the transport yes I mean I am very happy to say that we will ask the , the staff to look at that and perhaps I can just clarify the meaning of that paragraph ah in four point eight when it says a m a new member of staff it means a new member of staff will be responsible for health and safety not just one person on his own . ###Erm the er users and carers . 
223730:59	###District councils still have discretion to make grants in excess of twenty thousand pounds and er as Mr there can be th there are a limited number of those in the course of the year . ###We have no indication yet that any district council is thinking of reducing the amounts it pays merely because the mandatory limit has lowered from fifty to twenty . 
223734:25	###The erm Mrs referred to the buildings for the mental health . ###Erm I think we probably envisage those as no bigger than six at the outside people in any one house , domestic scale housing is what is envisaged there . 
223743:38	###We felt better be safe than sorry . ###Erm and also to prevent the handicapped people and perhaps for the very elderly it can be a little bit of an adventure . 
223758:69	###It could have gone either way in a sense . ###I 'm glad it 's th gone this way and not the other way . 
223772:56	###to us come from hospital discharge . ###Certainly the hospital discharge and certainly it is the case that th normally they come through the ward sister . 
223816:31	###She 's confined to bed with her second attack of flu in , since er since December , so that 's why she 's not here today . ###My apologies for not saying so at the beginning . 
223823:218	###that there was but the figures are actually not as er as er disappointing as er Mr may feel . ###We do acknowledge that the fatalities by the end of er by the end of December last year fatalities had increased in the county but that does , but that 's not really the figure that goes , go on because the numbers involved are actually quite small . 
223825:124	###Overall during last year , this is to the end of , of November actually because fin figures are n't available for the end of the year , the reduction was four point nine percent , which compares with four point three percent in the previous year , so not only are they still going down , they 're actually going down slightly more than they were in the previous year and that must be encouraging . ###And the next point on that is that the amount of road safety in the base budget figures , the amount from various different areas whether it 's education , training , publicity , accident investigation or traffic calming , that amount of money is untouched so the same amount will be spent in the coming year a as was spent last year . 
223882:37	###Not too many of you though I think ###Absolutely right . 
223987:63	###Right , thank you for that . ###are we lending the police the money ? 
224036:115	###No one seems to be querying the junction itself . ###What I would like to do . 
224039:74	###So I , I will go back to the developer and see if they will be prepared to fund traffic calming work . ###Of course , that is n't in the agreement that is already signed , so whether I shall be successful or not , of course we do n't know , but I will do that as a first resort . 
224051:12	###I would like to add please erm , and to seek any planning permission which may be necessary , to that recommendation . ###Just in case it 's , it is necessary at some time to , to put in a formal application for the road as well as the site . 
224061:7	###And they want the associated traffic management proposals included as part of the scheme . ###Now just a brief comment on that . 
224096:82	###They hear the access road . ###They would prefer to call it the . 
224183:21	###And erm on page thirty six , on two , is it a good idea because has a dreadful bend and I 'm really in favour of this . ###And on page thirty nine could we please make sure that the telephone box does not move closer to people 's homes . 
224249:42	###And that 's of , that 's of course aside from the grief and suffering that happens . ###In this case er many of the casualties are actually school children here . 
224255:52	###We 'd be better off to save the money . ###That 's all I want to say . 
224282:146	###Now , the cost of this scheme , if I can find it , is three hundred thousand pounds . ###That gives an idea of what the cost of traffic calming is these days , it 's extremely expensive . 
224299:148	###And erm I think Road is the key element of this traffic because not only is it a question of the estate but it 's the main through road from the up to Gatwick Airport and this is why er I understand that the calming proposal in road has yet to receive the M O T authority to use it because scheme . ###But I hope that as soon as possible we can with the various approvals and that the money will be found because I would suggest , without the speed reducing measures , this scheme will be a complete waste of money . 
224310:55	###Thank you Mr . ###I 've got Mr followed by Mr . 
224332:15	###We will continue to progress it . ###I would er agree actually with what I think Mr was a saying on balance , that 's it 's best to go with the bit that you 've got rather than hold that up to , to er to come back to Road later . 
224359:61	###Obviously , as erm I am in fact the local member referred to in er in the reports and erm it 's quite true that erm , it 's rare with some of these erm parking proposals that you get so much positive response from the residents but this has been very evident . ###The only , a the residents have , are of course , once again this goes back to this , the problems that we 're facing with the er local government reorganization debate , are at a loss to do er erm to find that the on-street parking provision is the county 's responsibility , off-street parking provision is the district 's responsibility and actions by , by the district are in fact causing problems for us with this . 
224482:105	###I would n't disagree with Mr in what he said about the more cuts we have the better it looks and so it stands to reason it 's a question of cost . ###But I think that he would probably agree , and I know he 's made comments at various times on this subject , about er the grass that is left behind and it is always a problem I think throughout the county erm where grass is cut and then spread around . 
224624:7	###It does n't look like it ###strange is n't it ? 
224642:9	###I 'll give you a selection of songs from it ###Erm , is it a new film ? 
224651:7	###Mhm ###As you probably know it 's presently showing at the cinema , and is a story of an Irish tenor Joseph Locke 
224872:22	###I think , well you see , this is the other thing , yes ###that 's right 
224979:154	###a wrap through R and R B 's not a hit ###No 
225011:81	###Mhm ###mm , you seemed to of , I mean you were a bit disappointed there were less , not so many visually impaired people were there , but they , they were sort of casting the net with council 
225035:36	###Oh right ###Mm 
225059:9	###that point later ###Mhm 
225179:9	###I started to look around and I put my hand up and it was lying at the back of my collar ###Mhm 
225180:4	###Mhm ###so it must come off very easily 
225201:18	###Aha , I see ###mm 
225273:28	###The only thing I can see there is the different venues will obviously will have different , differences to cope with that ###Of course , of course , yeah 
225277:41	###Mhm ###Mm , yes 
225285:11	###That 's right ###Yeah 
225345:33	###Oh no ###and said this is what you do , they would of heaved us straight out the door 
225388:21	###Where 's your audiences ? ###Yes , yeah 
225432:16	###That 's good ###We 're gonna start to send something 
225432:45	###That 's good ###We 're gonna start to send something 
225557:52	###where were you ###and I thought he 's not , he 
225562:7	###Is that in though ? ###Now that we know 
225695:41	###and the shop mobilities well you know ###Mhm 
225732:38	###We 've got groups of volunteers who take people to theatre as well as art ###Ah , ha 
225778:66	###Mm ###Yes 
225780:98	###out so you just , so maybe just , maybe , I 've taken a slight hard line to say no , people have got to make a wee bit effort too , but maybe in fact ###Maybe they do need the encouragement 
225782:29	###to go back , because to do this to get to this stage and find we 're not getting our audiences then , if that 's the answer we 'll just have to find the solution . ###Mm 
225830:45	###Oh I see , right ###and his response when , you 're doing the audio description as well , you know if the Society for the Blind wants to organize , I mean 
225920:53	###co-ordinator how we cope ###Well , well we see that 's , that 's why and , and I did seem to go about , I do n't 
225922:14	###Iris 's job , but I really wanted to raise that this time , we really have to have someone very , very quickly to protest , call it what you like ###Yeah 
225995:5	###That 's right ###all my staff were crying which did n't help 
226094:12	###I 'm sorry if I 'm a bit switched off I do n't what you 've been doing ! ###Qui qui er I actually do feel quite drained , fairly 
226485:12	###and if something happens that we feel is important and so one of your form tutors has something that they 're committed to and you wanna bring that in that 's fine . ###Mm . 
226544:40	###they 've done their mocks . ###I Milly and I will sort you out on that . 
226551:75	###Oh sorry . ###You 're gonna get a smack round the ear in a minute you really are ! 
226553:12	###Just bear with me a moment we can stay the same as we on subject specifics at the moment , we do n't have to change that , I 'm just trying to think in the light of national curriculum and what 's happening ###No . 
226557:68	###Cos we had a ###same . 
226566:7	###Weeks twenty and twenty one we do the summative documents for the I A P Sandra ? ###Twenty , twenty one ? 
226570:24	###Where 's your curriculum statements ? ###But I 've said the 
226607:66	###There 's no problem ! ###I I know ! 
226612:7	###I just sat there , got them all out one at a time and did the whole damn lot ! ###But some people it took three weeks to do I do n't know how the hell it did that , and I did n't even know 
226612:33	###I just sat there , got them all out one at a time and did the whole damn lot ! ###But some people it took three weeks to do I do n't know how the hell it did that , and I did n't even know 
226619:104	###Oh aye that 's new is n't it ? ###Right , I think what we 've 
226621:7	###You 've got a frown Sandra , on the notice board above the fridge it says this is to be included in next years record of achievement which I presume will have to go into yours as well after my year ###It 's on , it 's on Dave 's . 
226622:26	###It 's on , it 's on Dave 's . ###there has to be something said about attendance . 
226633:15	###It 's a big , ruddy big long sheet ! ###Well yeah , but that 's just it what am I supposed to put on ? 
226835:163	###Good idea ! ###the teacher acts as a conscience I I explained to them I 'm not expecting them to make the child do the work , but to be their conscience so they can say look you 've got three assessments coming in that week if you leave it till Friday night you 're up the creak without a paddle ! 
226844:60	###So are you talking , you 're saying to me that 's a full term 's work ? ###I 'm looking to be pushing because I , I I might ask them to get speakers in etcetera . 
226859:36	###able to take , I 've never done an industry day ###Right . 
226902:246	###Fourthly that each child on that action plan would have outlined where they would hope to go and following that have found out what the requirements are , the possible pathway through and if they are n't sure , I was gon , what I was gonna ask was , if I could have a careers teacher in to talk to form about possible pathway through , i in the general terms so they 've got these four outcomes there . ###Right . 
226909:103	###so at their half term , February half term I would like to think they 've got those four things on , we 've got ###Yeah . 
226920:12	###Er , and I would like to pick up a unit after every half term but around that , you know , somewhere along get them into something really tangible ###Has has has Anne written a unit on the family ? 
226964:37	###Yeah . ###you 've got . 
226984:22	###er , to gratify in inverted ###Mm . 
226990:31	###Mm . ###Mhm . 
227035:31	###Mm . ###the booklet choices and then the discussion can get going but the careers officer for half an hour . 
227035:108	###Mm . ###the booklet choices and then the discussion can get going but the careers officer for half an hour . 
227035:274	###Mm . ###the booklet choices and then the discussion can get going but the careers officer for half an hour . 
227039:31	###the way round him with him buying ###Well 
227059:15	###and we actually we actually had done the options ###Aye . 
227060:7	###Aye . ###and then it all had to be scrapped and by the middle 
227081:68	###so if you 're putting it in the second half of the second term ###If I come running along here same old bug bear cos I 'm science , I still have no confirmation from anybody yet what about these SATS that the kids do ? 
227084:247	###And technology do SATS this year . ###you 're doing , well there 's four , there 's half the , nearly half the curriculum the kids are doing 
227088:39	###No choice . ###it says so ! 
227152:17	###choice . ###Mm 
227166:7	###That , that is one part of the tutorial programme , the ninth year that you ca n't change ###Mm mm . 
227184:7	###Right . ###as Sandra says we 've done it twice this year . 
227208:59	###And she likes that garden and she does n't mind working for something on that . ###I think that , you know George would n't mind er , and Maria would n't mind , maybe it 's Martin trying to find for for our Martin . 
227342:7	###No . ###No ! 
227403:35	###English department did it last term . ###Yeah yeah . 
227421:79	###Anyway , to get back to what I said ###Hold your breath ! 
227421:102	###Anyway , to get back to what I said ###Hold your breath ! 
227435:9	###It may well be that we send what we consider to be the fuller report there . ###Mm . 
227435:63	###It may well be that we send what we consider to be the fuller report there . ###Mm . 
227436:29	###Mm . ###All we have to do is report to the parents once a year it does n't say that everything has to be on the report sheet at the same time it may well be some information goes at one particular time and some at another . 
227459:103	###just at the start of G C S E exams . ###Mm . 
227496:9	###Milvia 's finished . ###Year eight . 
227706:23	###Right . ###That that we did 
227874:79	###Right , but perhaps what we should do now is in-bill that get your policy group member to agree it , even line your video up and so they are committed and you put it on paper so all the form tutors see that ###and the head or whoever it is is committed at that time to be taking the rest of the year so they can profile . 
227955:25	###which will cu that , and they will all go home that the format has been basically agreed . ###But we will in a spirit of recording achievement have a form tutor sheet if you like . 
227992:22	###they need to , or ca n't remember third one it does n't matter . ###Mhm . 
227996:24	###there is then a choice ###Mm . 
228140:7	###Because I do n't think that , I mean , given last year 's year seven they cannot cope with that ! ###the pace , no . 
228201:44	###Mm . ###and it 's u , there for manning it 
228261:39	###Mm . ###for homework though 
228286:121	###Well it 's jus just a little booklet really ###Mm mm . 
228321:10	###Yeah . ###And saying , right we 'll do them 
228329:9	###important . ###No . 
228391:7	###will they do it ? ###Yeah but will this proposal 
228392:152	###Yeah but will this proposal ###They have to . 
228393:10	###They have to . ###of getting i the some sort of a working a relationship a at a more detailed where in between , we 're between the staff the teaching staff and the tutor , the form tutors help the teaching staff , especially and say in your department where you you 're gonna have to give them more homework . 
228401:10	###right I want to see the homework , those that have n't got it etcetera . ###Yeah , but will it 
228424:14	###Because if I 've , if it 's handed into me , period one and I 've got them period four I 'm not gonna mark it I 'm never gonna get round to marking it ! ###And I 'm gonna hand the books back out 
228453:199	###and he said he 'd , he 'd let me know before Christmas if he can get me back on a Wednesday , but I 'm still taken on a Wednesday but my friend takes me in the car on a Wednesday but er I like to go in the ambulance you see really so er ###Yeah 
228461:159	###He gave , they gave us all a lovely mug each , beautiful ###Oh that was very kind 
228463:70	###Yeah , yeah was kind , it was kind of them , yes and we went all round the shops and er I thoroughly enjoyed it and in the new Co-Op as well you know , I thoroughly enjoyed it but he took me in the car so that we did n't have to hang about you see ###Yeah . 
228471:127	###Got a lot ###Mm , what did erm the dentist and hospitals used to be like before the New Town was built ? 
228473:72	###Well we only had Epping hospital dear , that 's all we had , there was only Epping and er they were er you know done what they could very good and we had a dentist , oh dentist you had to go er , oh right to Old Harlow , up er ###It 's a long way 
228498:25	###Mm ###so we brought her up , brought her up , she lived with me until she got married you see dear . 
228500:79	###Yeah , did a lot of people have to go in homes in those days , or is it just like today ? ###Mm 
228501:41	###Mm ###and the warden was there in her dressing gown trying to get her up and she could n't get her up this morning , so she had to get help , one of the workmen came along and helped from the top terrible to say though it is , yeah , never mind , they get over it 
228605:50	###Yes , that 's right , yes ###erm and that the number of sockets changed 
228637:7	###Oh yes , yes ###sold an awful lot of them 
228752:128	###come on ###Do you think that there 's a fashion in light fittings , I mean you 've noticed the change 
228768:50	###Yes ###very soon after we got here , but er the Corporation never put any wall light in houses 
228803:164	###Yes ###can you remember the , the colours that they were in ? 
228824:24	###Sugar Dougy , come here ###did they , or did they just like , did they just look at the colour and the shape of it , and the style of it ? 
228824:51	###Sugar Dougy , come here ###did they , or did they just like , did they just look at the colour and the shape of it , and the style of it ? 
228925:159	###Yeah forty six ###I thought that was bad enough having to stay another year 
228951:66	###ten per cent of building workers and er about five per cent of British hired mechanic staff . ###It was a mixed development ? 
228952:9	###It was a mixed development ? ###It was a mixed development with very much the emphasis on Corporation staff at that time er and of course they had to house the , got house 
229022:9	###of me getting a house . ###Could I ask you to go back and ask you to describe what the Nissan hut was like , what kind of a accommodation did you have in it ? 
229023:11	###Could I ask you to go back and ask you to describe what the Nissan hut was like , what kind of a accommodation did you have in it ? ###So you had to pick it up and carry it outside ? 
229076:109	###Well it does here , I do n't know er , I would n't say in some of the parts of Harlow I would get that feeling , but then I am really a country person at heart and I do n't like towns anyway , so I 'm not really the best person to ask , no . ###Could we go back and perhaps you tell me , erm what it felt like , for example cooking a meal or doing the washing in a Nissan hut and the difference of when you came in to to Chipping Field 
229076:158	###Well it does here , I do n't know er , I would n't say in some of the parts of Harlow I would get that feeling , but then I am really a country person at heart and I do n't like towns anyway , so I 'm not really the best person to ask , no . ###Could we go back and perhaps you tell me , erm what it felt like , for example cooking a meal or doing the washing in a Nissan hut and the difference of when you came in to to Chipping Field 
229125:169	###do things , ca n't you ? ###Mm 
229144:9	###No , no , that would n't worry me , I just , I said when we got rid of our other sideboard let 's do without one and then I looked round and thought well what the dickens am I going to do with all this stuff that we 've got and I just found that we could n't do without it . ###Mm , so 
229144:83	###No , no , that would n't worry me , I just , I said when we got rid of our other sideboard let 's do without one and then I looked round and thought well what the dickens am I going to do with all this stuff that we 've got and I just found that we could n't do without it . ###Mm , so 
229150:32	###He was and because he was getting on in years and er did n't get out as much as usual , my husband said we 'd get a television for him and we had a black and white television ###Would you remember what year that was ? 
229183:33	###It 's very nice ###Mm lovely 
229219:23	###I do n't need it very often , erm I 'm not a bad asthmat , it 's an allergy to animals ###Right . 
229219:47	###I do n't need it very often , erm I 'm not a bad asthmat , it 's an allergy to animals ###Right . 
229325:29	###At the start , aye . ###And then what happened ? 
229326:9	###And then what happened ? ###And then it just became a drug that I had to take for every day use . 
229336:82	###I want to get off drugs ? ###Well the point that I wanted to get off drugs was , my family not wanting any more to do with me , erm , they 'd shut the door on me . 
229340:94	###No , not just one day , as I said , I 'd been trying for a few ###Yeah . 
229343:84	###What what what do you think of those two experiences ? ###Yes ? 
229344:41	###Yes ? ###I admire them for being able to sit there in front of everybody and say they actually , what they 've been through because it must have been sheer hell er , trying to come off and withdrawal symptoms , I mean , I do n't know much about it cos I 've never taken well I smoke 
229373:16	###And I 'm not going to pick on you so you can feel free to answer the question . ###Button one for yes , and button two for no . 
229382:7	###Maybe ###Aha . 
229401:7	###Aha . ###that is run in the secondary schools in the first year where the children are talked to by the police and they see videos and they are a act 
229458:24	###legal now , if some of the people here could see the damage that cannabis does , it 's the first step towards hard drugs ! ###And I do n't know anybody that addicts , I deal with a lot of addicts , and a lot of families and it all started on cannabis so , you should nah talk about legalizing any drug ! 
229466:18	###Up there . ###Yes ? 
229482:25	###The papers have taken it up , and as such , there 's an awful lot of hype about it , and I think makes it more attractive . ###Yes ? 
229483:29	###Yes ? ###Well I just wonder you , there has got to be some kind of relationship between the fact that most people who take drugs live in really run down deprived areas . 
229489:56	###No ! ###You do n't think that ? 
229489:72	###No ! ###You do n't think that ? 
229633:20	###And so , how 's that affe , I mean , what do you think about that ? ###Because at the end of the day are we not responsible for ourselves ? 
229677:59	###What are all the asthma sufferers , and arthritis sufferers , and various people going to do ? ###Yes ? 
229791:7	###They can be specifically blocked by several toxins , for example tetrodotoxin , commonly written T T X , which comes from a Japanese Puffer Fish . ###It 's actually a er erm Japanese delicacy . 
229827:12	###So we can express then the overall form of the action potential in terms of the differential activity , first of sodium channels and then of potassium ac channels . ###And of course the the rationale for its label of delayed rectifier is now apparent , it shows some delay before it 's open before it opens . 
230044:7	###Well , of course , there 's a sense in which he could easily have prayed for them , but at that moment , in that particular place , that was not God 's purpose . ###And this is sometimes where we get a little bit , you know , hung up , a a and and when we tend to make a little bit , we make mistakes a lot . 
230162:41	###There should be the the aca station if you like , there should be the documentation , and it certainly seems in the New Testament that that is speaking with other tongues , it 's not the only thing of course . ###You see , it 's not just speaking in other tongues , there is gonna become the evidence of it as well as we grow in him . 
230164:153	###Notice also , that there is no evidence or suggestion that they had to wait for th for this baptism , for this infilling of the Holy Spirit . ###It is God 's free gift to all . 
230171:9	###And so it 's not a case of our waiting it 's rather a case of our receiving . ###You see if I was to say to you , right well I am gonna go out and purchase something , I 'm gonna get something and give it to you as a gift 
230173:100	###then you have got to wait until I do that . ###I might go out and buy it straight away , I might wait weeks , months before I acquire the particular thing to give to you as a gift , you 've gotta wait on on me giving it to you . 
230177:48	###Any time lag , any any period of waiting is because you have n't come and received it . ###And so it is with God 's gift of the Holy Spirit . 
230228:12	###It is a gift after all . ###Holiness , sanctification , living of Godly life , living a pure life they 're not the criteria , they 're not , they 're not , God requires that of us , but they are not requirements for receiving the Holy Spirit . 
230229:12	###Holiness , sanctification , living of Godly life , living a pure life they 're not the criteria , they 're not , they 're not , God requires that of us , but they are not requirements for receiving the Holy Spirit . ###We do n't have to get to a certain stage of holiness . 
230336:15	###And when he comes home he calls to gather his friends and his neighbours saying to them , rejoice with me for I have found my sheep which was lost ! ###I tell you the same way , there will be more joy in heaven over one sinner who repents , than over ninety nine righteous persons who need no repentance . 
230374:28	###And these religious leaders did n't like it . ###And there are a lot of religious folk today who do n't like it who get peeved , and who think it should n't be . 
230381:53	###Now there are times when Jesus actually sat down with his disciples afterwards and explained to them what the parable was about and there was a reason for that , it was because , simply , the folk would not have understood it . ###Jesus was speaking to them in a , in a concealed language , it was only for his disciples , and whilst all the people heard it , they did n't understand it , the disciples did n't understand it , and Jesus afterwards explained to his followers what he was saying . 
230524:18	###Each of us has turned to his own way . ###Rescuing that sheep was not an easy task . 
230664:7	###So it 's X cubed . ###What about this one ? 
230810:18	###So , so ###Ooh . 
231036:12	###Okay . ###Now subtract 
231139:16	###But you could write your equation that way . ###Er if someone says that 's not good enough , I want it in terms of Y equals 
231144:39	###So if , if I say draw erm Y equals the square root of X , and you think I have n't got a clue what that looks like . ###You can square both sides . 
231156:18	###Y squared equals X . ###Yeah . 
231168:13	###Oh , that 's too many . ###No actually , 
231170:10	###Oh you 'll have to ###Oh I 'm sorry , I 'll go back to three . 
231170:35	###Oh you 'll have to ###Oh I 'm sorry , I 'll go back to three . 
231259:43	###It does n't need to brake or does it just ? ###Mm . 
231259:50	###It does n't need to brake or does it just ? ###Mm . 
231328:39	###Yeah , because I mean it had them in our exam , ###Right . 
231329:34	###Right . ###in our mock , we had like those four pictures , and you had to say which was 
231400:11	###Sorry , , make it ten seconds . ###Plus one second . 
231560:61	###No , times that by a thousand over one . ###Times that by a thousand . 
231659:9	###South . ###South . 
231815:42	###Yeah . ###I suppose 
232369:14	###Put me down . ###Tom , put me down . 
232394:6	###Tony something 's arose suddenly and er ###And fallen . 
232542:20	###Er well Tony 's going to deliver it and pick it up on the Monday . ###Oh that 's all right . 
232544:17	###And I said he 'd have to pay extra for the minibus hire . ###T to shift the gear , cos he wants a couple 
232773:15	###Apart from , did you get your room booking form back ? ###Yeah , I 've had it confirmed by room bookings . 
232777:51	###We could dance round them , there 'd be enough space , you know . ###Well offer the , offer the forty people reduced tickets for the barn dance . 
232805:56	###I mean just because it 's next ###does n't mean it should get priority . 
232839:80	###It was an hou ###Cos 
232873:46	###and you were there for half past five . ###We left here at half past five . 
232874:16	###We left here at half past five . ###No , you said you were there for half past five , because you had to get there before half past five in order to book it . 
232874:54	###We left here at half past five . ###No , you said you were there for half past five , because you had to get there before half past five in order to book it . 
232875:21	###No , you said you were there for half past five , because you had to get there before half past five in order to book it . ###We had , we had to get there before six , when they shut , we had to go at half past five , . 
232951:27	###That is ###I mean 
233157:24	###Can I please ? ###Yes , . 
233238:14	###So ? ###Erm , 
233277:34	###Erm , last year , we were given it for free , erm ###Right , I remember , yeah . 
233370:4	###erm ###they already get special dispensation . 
233430:64	###mm ###Okay , so what , what are you er , hitting on about there Adrian ? 
233476:67	###I think erm the tide is changing to a certain degree er on that point , but agricultural fundamentalism as it 's called erm , tt is quite an important er aspect is political erm is political motivation for a support or for protectionism okay . ###Erm right so because trade in er trade in agricultural goods has fallen , one one of the reason for that is because there 's been a lot protectionism on er agricultural goods the other side of that coin is that protectionism in manufactured goods has has fallen okay . 
233493:243	###So domestic policies will always have an international dimension to them alright , there are a large number of beneficiaries and losers erm to this policy er to protectionism alright . ###Now just to give you some numbers erm on er who gains and who loses right erm right for the world as a whole right , erm the study conducted by right nineteen eighty nine I looked at the cost of some benefits from agricultural support alright , in nineteen eighty six to nineteen eighty seven in just one year one crop year alright . 
233532:85	###so are you all going home fairly sharpish ? ###Oh yeah tomorrow night 
233536:10	###right , well in that case ###erm we 'll put a notice up or something erm around the exam period and let you know when we we will go out and we 'll try sneak a few beers in after your exams but before the start of the second semester so erm 
233575:11	###What we now want in T minus one was , cos that was the actual price what we do n't know what was the expectation of prices in T minus one . ###Well we can use the same decision rule and just change the subscripts by one , so you 've got gamma into P T minus two right , plus one minus gamma the expectation of T minus three , prices T minus two okay , and we could substitute right , the right hand side here , right , into the expec , into that expectation up there . 
233599:107	###Okay . ###So you too would assume quoick transformation we 've got a geometric progression in here that goes off to infinity alright which is equivalent to that , that little thing alright , we 've got three parameters here this one , that one and that one , alright , so we converted what is an infinite stream into a finite stream using this er , quoick transformation . 
233607:80	###Now the reason why we 've gone through all these horrible equations right , and looked at the adaptive expectations model and the partial adjustment model is because both of these two things are incorporated into single res erm a single supply response model that was developed by Nerlove Nur Nerlove in nineteen fifty eight old model but very very popular , right . ###This Nerlove supply response model that incorporates both adaptive expectations and the partial adjustment hypothesis alright , has been applied so that five hundred , right , different commodities throughout the world right . 
233703:58	###Yeah , yeah . ###Perhaps there 's no need to 
233728:52	###Printing has its own separate procedure . ###I think one of the problems is not taking out rate card , if you leave out , if you actually say this procedure does not cover full estimates and costs or costing based on rate cards . 
233732:34	###Er , we 're gonna need . ###Contact cover the procedure . 
233738:20	###Erm , you can read the suggestion there , two point three , two point four . ###My only concern is two point four . 
233741:54	###Do we have a list of authorised researchers , that is people who are authorised to give costed clearances . ###Yes , each division has erm , . 
233751:54	###No . ###' Cos it , for example , in support when it came to the 
233751:64	###No . ###' Cos it , for example , in support when it came to the 
233753:10	###I do n't know how other people are doing the guidelines but by definition the divisional guidelines must n't say , must define who the authorised people are , or those . ###Whether they do it by name or by status level or whatever else , really does n't matter . 
233760:75	###So , we agree two point four . ###Erm , we have n't let anyone disagree with that either . 
233848:33	###I would prefer that we accepted that Stella 's original notes defines the responsibility for forms literally for all the time . ###So do I . 
233927:125	###Five point ten . ###Five point ten . 
233928:15	###Five point ten . ###This was the thing that came up previously about er , dispatch of a report not being recorded anywhere , because of that was a compliment slip which a photocopy was n't kept and so we erm , therefore have to have a note made on the client contact form to say it 's gone . 
233931:13	###That was n't the original , that was never briefed . ###No . 
233933:31	###But if we have to do that . ###a major new 
233998:30	###Right . ###So , what if it says Simon , because I was n't paying attention . 
234090:176	###Erm can someone make it clear to me where we ended up with Q P5 , I am not sure whether we are changing the application or deleting Yes the exception both doing both your doing both yes . ###Is this being appraised with the exception or continuous service with the application , and we are deleting that point 4 does n't apply to access . 
234124:57	###Erm in order to simplify the approvals from Support Division , field approval is recorded on the field review form , data preparation and D P approval is recorded on data preparation schedule the name of the person giving approval , the name of the person , the names of D P 's approvals are recorded on the research approval form . ###So obviously you just write down that Rita did it on the 10th . 
234140:36	###Someone 's got to check the filters are right ###The does that on a Catty Questionnaire 
234143:64	###Mmm , it 's that element of double checking that ###But , I mean that D P team do a lot of work on the Catty questionnaires which does n't really seem to be er sort of fully acknowledged at the moment . 
234150:15	###We got D P 9.16 , 28.32 we 've still got four to do . ###Are any of those other one simple , what you would consider simple ones to understand ? 
234210:52	###Q P16 we are going to move on from then , unless there are any other comments on Q P16 , Rita is going to attempt to redraft and draw together material from previous procedures , and that means that adjustments of previous procedures you will be able to sign , and finalise them . ###Sorry , are you saying that erm we are going to delay doing anything about Q P5 . 
234260:120	###Yeah , yeah . ###Good . 
234266:48	###Bottom pile in choices if you can send it back . ###Are there any spares to erm oh yeah thank you , 
234291:68	###Well that depends on whether you are actually doing it during an audit or doing it for other reasons , what they are looking for is that your system is getting better and that you have done the right things . ###Well thank you . 
234318:19	###You 've done that . ###laughing 
234380:7	###Thank you , Stella . ###We just raised an instance of the next point of the minute . 
234494:45	###That Jenny has designed . ###Jenny T , do n't know , ' cos it was down to Jenny D to 
234517:8	###May I ask then formally those who wish to pass , now to the vote on the amendment ###I 'm that 
234548:107	###Isle of ###Isle of oh 
234606:52	###but Jim makes the point he said that if if if when you sign a declaration you say ###Er yeah exclude your short story , otherwise it could mean on you know it could be taken out and sold somewhere and then in interest you would sell your own for selling your own word you know that could be a possibility . 
234643:97	###No , that came back after all that time erm , no this this was the call called The Birthday it was about a split in the future where she erm ###Oh yes 
234654:34	###Oh , you did do it and I did n't . ###Very important . 
234804:99	###Fred Thomson has been reading Home Sweet Home by Roy Ramsay . ###Yes it 's struggle in accent 
234841:31	###He said well you 're very lucky he said by my estimation that 's worth four thousand pounds ###I was , I was thinking cos I 've got an old copper kettle 
234940:27	###and while we do consider each one , cannot offer individual reports or criticisms of every script that arrives . ###Many of the stories selected for short story are from published collections established authors some are commissioned specifically for the slot . 
234966:45	###but I really thought ###particularly the length of time that was away I was really sure that had got on to incidentally it 's worth saying that the B B C re they do they use professional readers who make a report on every piece they receive and they file them . 
234967:28	###particularly the length of time that was away I was really sure that had got on to incidentally it 's worth saying that the B B C re they do they use professional readers who make a report on every piece they receive and they file them . ###So if ever you read work apiece , and re-submit it , you must change the title because if if you send it in , they look up to see if they 've seen that title before , if it was rejected before it will be rejected automatically . 
235053:17	###Well when you said something like that , it 's not just one person who 's gonna have a look is there ? ###Is it ? 
235163:80	###He 'd won a bursary to a local grammar school when he was eleven and then gone on to an apprenticeship with an engineering firm which employed a quarter of the town 's local inhabitants . ###That has sadly gone now , another victim of the recession . 
235163:168	###He 'd won a bursary to a local grammar school when he was eleven and then gone on to an apprenticeship with an engineering firm which employed a quarter of the town 's local inhabitants . ###That has sadly gone now , another victim of the recession . 
235273:32	###It 's so difficult to add up the the hours , but I mean it 's a number of days of course it 's not working solidly you know , maybe only for an up an hour or an hour . ###Well once I 've got you know once I 've got the shape of the story in my mind I can it down in an hour or so every time you know it 's in long hand , then it takes me hours to type it but er you know the actual once I 've got the idea I I find it necessary to get it all down you know in long hand as quickly as possible . 
235298:40	###So far though the viewers had not been at all suitable . ###Some had children that are at an age where there might be a tendency towards vandalism , one of whom had been speedily dealt with by her when he attempted to slide down the oak bannister , kicking her as he went down . 
235458:10	###Do you con will you continue that story that I listened to a week before cos I was n't here last week ###Yes , I I have n't I I did half er sort of half finished it . 
235560:9	###The first one , turning over the page , relates to er , grant maintained schools , erm , the fact that erm , the calculation of the indirect maintenance grant is based on last year 's percentages . ###Erm , so , instead of paying for primary schools , eleven point nine per cent , which is the the actual er amount of er indirect support that is provided within the erm , Education Department , and seven that 's in relation to primary schools , and seven point eight per cent schools .

235562:82	###We have to pay the , er , ninety two , three percentages , which were fifteen point two per cent and nine point eight per cent , so there 's an additional element there , and also we have to deal with erm , the additional cash that goes to grant maintained schools , who went grant maintained prior to the first of April nineteen ninety-two . ###They are protected at the cash additions that they had er , or originally and they are somewhat higher than the erm , actual , erm , indirect per percentages would be . 
235608:23	###I think we got to know around mid-February . ###So , if if the same pattern is followed , it would be middle of February , before we we we find out what the arrangements will be . 
235617:12	###Chairman , I think the Chair of Education 's comments were bias . ###It has nothing to do with the individual grant maintained schools . 
235631:131	###As I say , the er , it is , it is two million less , than what the government has assessed we should be receiving in interest payments . ###Just commenting on the er , grant maintained schools . 
235712:72	###Nevertheless , it is erm , set once again , in the er context of the overall County Council budget proposal for next year being three hundred and eighty one million pound . ###That was an overall estimate that erm , members on this side , apposed very vigorously when it was first put forward in policy , and that any budget er , proposals put to committees that er , based on that false premise , erm , would also er be criticised and erm , opposed by this side . 
235790:17	###Thank you , yeah . ###I just referred Councillor Wild to paragraph eleven on page A three , because , it it does say reasonably clearly , I think , that the Policy Committee resolved to review the overall level of spending in January nineteen ninety-four in the light of the Revenue Support Grant Settlement . 
235791:192	###I just referred Councillor Wild to paragraph eleven on page A three , because , it it does say reasonably clearly , I think , that the Policy Committee resolved to review the overall level of spending in January nineteen ninety-four in the light of the Revenue Support Grant Settlement . ###We had , we had to conservative speakers so far , erm , and Councillor Brock seem to me , in a sense to be summing up that phrase about knowing the price of everything and the value of nothing , because there was the the the es essential arithmetical calculation about percentages , and savings . 
235876:263	###I I do n't mind , but I 'm opposing , as like the rest of us the budget in ###I think you , Mr Chairman , it would be totally improper if we did not raise the issue within the within the budget if we did not raise the issue of election members and the expenses of election members . 
235891:30	###I realise this information , it 's very depressing information . ###Now , of course , we we know that that you know , that that that that er , that even then , part of that settlement has has gone because they 've cut off on the of the Western by-pass , I mean , you 've still got er , er 
235904:136	###Well , if he lived in the north- east , er part of this county , that great ar area where there is very little in terms of infrastructure perhaps er er it 's a pity we ca n't have a few more hysterics and we would perhaps get further down the road . ###Thank you , Chairman 
235965:24	###Th the will be other new schemes that were , not yet come forward , because the local media have not , erm , addressed a particular area , but as soon as it does in March or April , then the town conservatives would have done that next year . ###And the , and the list goes on . 
235994:11	###Not for the conservative party or the liberal party or the labour party . ###It is called benefit and and the well being of those kids about there , that we 're educating them at our own school , that they can have jobs and work , and if this is going , my fear is , okay we can live within this , s as you say , it may that it 's just bad settlement for one year . 
236003:7	###Can I come back ###Er , Mrs Pinchbetter said . 
236045:102	###Erm , the local government act nineteen ninety-two permits the auditor to actually advise the council to er matters which we believe that you should consider in full , er er , County erm , Council meeting , and I 'm pleased to confirm that for this year there is nothing of that nature , that er , we would put to you , to refer to . ###Lincolnshire has a lot of history of being a well managed authority , a proved exercising sound controls on its financial and management affairs , and I 'm pleased to say that I 'm again in a position to confirm that that is our view , for the conduct of the Council 's business in the period on which we are reporting . 
236067:110	###I think it 's fair to say , that we do not all matters , and I hope that nobody 's here that would appreciate that the audit role is an independent role . ###We have considerable rights , of inspection , search , discussion , and the right to documents . 
236082:125	###Is he saying , I understand sir , that you , you approve of cross border tampering from other local authorities or not ? ###Erm , may I take the opportunity to say that cross border is a bit of a misnomer , erm , it 's , the correct term is really doing work for other bodies . 
236095:7	###Er , but the question that I 'd like to a a ask is , erm , reducing , er it 's about capital , because er , where the capital is being in use , and and like yesterday reducing capital is always an easy option . ###Requesting when there was fifty million programmes , and that it 's it 's it 's an option that governments always take . 
236098:101	###Lincolnshire 's capital , lively financed from revenue , of course grants , and property sales etc. are sold , that money can be transferred into services , and money can be borrowed . ###So it is easy option to borrow and spend that money on services . 
236111:11	###I do not wish to discuss ###Well , I , seriously , Mr Chairman , conservative group for the County Council of Westminster is a lot better than it is . 
236141:71	###I think it 's also reasonable to point out , that at the moment , the County Council does enter into finance lease arrangements to meet the business needs , of for example Translink and Computer Services . ###It 's been accepted that these are credit arrangements under the local government Planning and Land Act , so therefore , it is not unreasonable to argue that borrowing will not represent a new departure for the County Council in terms of being able to control capital spending . 
236146:9	###If that 's the case , then we could argue , an and will do , that now is a good time to borrow on a fixed term basis over a long period . ###I think to sum up , I would be wanting to say , that this County Council takes a view that it is about the provision of services . 
236149:18	###given priority . ###When you realise that we have had one of the most difficult spending erm , decisions taken by 
236149:133	###given priority . ###When you realise that we have had one of the most difficult spending erm , decisions taken by 
236160:7	###er , five hundred million budget , or your own household budget , er , in basic terms , is is fairly simple . ###And anyone who has controlled a a household budget , will well understand that in the present sort of climate , that is the real world outside this County Council . 
236168:13	###You use your Access Cards . ###We look at things that we would like to do , and set our priorities . 
236234:42	###That 's five or six per cent on the debt . ###So you 're gonna pay more for that . 
236237:57	###You 're lucky you got one . ###It says on it , you can pay two hundred pounds , or over three years , or you can pay ten pounds . 
236311:39	###Selling off the family silver . ###The times that has come out of your mouths . 
236320:12	###You make commitments for next year , as as if , money had gonna be no object . ###You your criticising the the government is not giving you as much grant as you would like . 
236326:40	###and as Councillor said . ###Here we are , in a matter of what eight to nine months of inheriting , a well financed , a well run , an effective , efficient organisation with a reasonable amount of na balances . 
236359:46	###I think one was out at Caister . ###So that where we 're at at this point in time . 
236388:9	###Thank you . ###Er , that is carried . 
236394:7	###We 're moving on to the next paper . ###The next er , paper . 
236409:29	###Erm , yes , Mr Chairman . ###Erm , certainly it 's a most interesting paper and er , certainly I think in the County we 're doing very much er , think ever possible . 
236520:30	###Any other contributions ? ###If I could just pick up the point you made Councillor , I think that at the A C C discussions , there was a great deal of cognition and understanding of the need to consult with staff side , in the run up to the beginning of formal consultations . 
236522:149	###And I think that a comprehensive consultation exercise has got to bear in mind that the key question , and that 's affordability . ###That we recognise that local authorities are in a a difficult position . 
236558:122	###Erm , we 're meeting er on a fairly regular basis with them , to see if we can seek some solution . ###And you 'll see in the report that we do point out , that some of the training that we do , things like woodwork training , and brickwork training , are relatively expensive to deliver , compared with other training of occupations . 
236563:34	###It 's in part a government , and partly E C funding programme , and er the rules on that have been changed which will make many more people eligible for assistance with er , er insulation on their houses . ###Trained people are on the way , and many of the people that we train go onto work college , other commercial agencies . 
236572:26	###There 's some valuable work gone on there , and you can , and if and if we 're going to deny these people , the opportunity of of achieving anything like their potential , I mean , it seems such a shame , when we , you know , when we are succeeding in the rest of the programme . ###And I would like to ask you , er er and the rest of the committee of who , whatever we can do , and that the officers should advise us what we can do , to to to make a further submission . 
236589:38	###And so what we did , we ran this particular course , erm , for which we we received a fee , but it came back as expenses area , was n't under the same arrangement as the rest of it . ###And and we pla , got people placed in various work places which was sympathetic to their particular disabilities . 
236685:74	###There are in this second page national comparisons between June ninety-two and June , ninety-three between local authorities . ###It is of limited usefulness , and it 's perhaps a requirement on local government that they could very well drop . 
236717:56	###We do want to provide information that is useful to you in in in the overall management of the employees resource and accounting . ###Erm , always has a 
236745:29	###I think , sir it will be very very difficult to identify , erm , quite where the reductions are . ###As you know the authorities or control very very closely , as to the additional members of staff that come on . 
236781:53	###Thank you . ###Well , I 'd just like to comment on the , as here we 're talking about the Environment Officer . 
236810:48	###It 's under the Exe Execs Department Employee Resources . ###Yes . 
236834:59	###You 've been very indulgent , Chair . ###Councillor 
236858:53	###If I 'm , please , if I 'd known I 'm sorry , sir ###Yes , it is in the authorities interests that as many of it 's travelling employees as possible use the car contract hire scheme , because it saves the authority money , and yes , officers around this large county have the cheapest possible rates . 
236858:87	###If I 'm , please , if I 'd known I 'm sorry , sir ###Yes , it is in the authorities interests that as many of it 's travelling employees as possible use the car contract hire scheme , because it saves the authority money , and yes , officers around this large county have the cheapest possible rates . 
236860:47	###To see that there is a take up of the car contract hire scheme , it constantly has to be held , or kept unde , the scheme has to be kept under review , to make sure that it is attractive and it is what er , the employees want to see , and would prefer rather than an alternate means of transport . ###So we 're , do encourage it , we hope that it will grow and resume counties interest if it does grow . 
236935:21	###Oay , so there could be ###So there could be a number of chartered engineer vacancies come up , during those four to eight years , but during the next four years , hopefully , we will be able to recruit one female chartered engineer . 
236942:38	###You are right , and indeed , all of our advice , all the particular professional that Michael union gives to all of the the er , County Council matters , is that recruitment is on merit . ###It is unlawful , accept in two areas , to er discriminate in the way that you suggested , but essentially our our appointment process is on merit . 
236963:13	###I worked in a construction industry and er , and it was a male orientated dominated er industry , and I think what Councillor is probably just taking small parts in isolation , Highways and Planning which has at least one chartered engineer and additional female . ###You 've then got to go below that and say , this was achieved through actual and it is the advertising making the public aware that we are prepared to employ females providing they 're good enough . 
236969:14	###will er the the younger people will be encouraged to start to accept this and it is a change in our thinking , that it , I find it difficult as well . ###But I 'm certain , by doing it this way , we will encourage females to put in for these these posts . 
237001:12	###Yeah , thank you , Chairman . ###I know the erm , remarks made about getting extra people to register and to have their green card , I 'm probably one of a few councillors with a green card . 
237030:87	###Yes , Chair , if I may , it 'll be relatively quick . ###We brought a a report to you , er , last time , in relation to Trade Union Recognition in the er B sector , giving up most of our erm , employees have now gone to the independent colleges . 
237042:38	###Staff Commission Report . ###Thank you , Chair . 
237104:97	###I think it 's wise for the local government superannuation scheme . ###The proposals Department of the Environment are actually for sixty- six weeks , but including existing statutory requirements , which can be as much as thirty weeks for the long serving employee . 
237212:78	###That 's the of con of considerable concern , and it will mean possibly that faith er farm workers who rely on overtime to increase it 's wages will will suffer as a result . ###So I do hope er that we that we do not support this , er , we 've got to remember , it 's not , Europe , is not the end all and be all of the world , there is a there is a Far East out there , there 's the Japans of the world , the Koreans . 
237236:13	###Very recently , not so long ago , I saw on programme on India , in in one of the sweat-shops , you saw young children , boys and girls about twelve years old , on their hands and knees making matches , and a man walking down the centre with a stick . ###That was , that 's the reality of cheap imports from the Third World . 
237320:54	###He worked in the private sector of industry in the w d in the wool industry for many years when wool was the staple industry of . ###Later he came to work at the house which was his first entry into Local Government . 
237362:248	###My first meeting with was e a I doubt whether he actually remembers er but it was actually on an Inter City , I do n't know whether he does remember , on an Inter City back from London erm three or four years ago when h he also tried to get me to join the Labour Party if I remember rightly . ###One thing that can be said about is that he he 's never drab . 
237387:13	###I would like to thank Councillor , Councillor , Councillor er Councillor for the kind things that have been said about me in proposing my nomination as Lord Mayor . ###I did n't recognise myself , to be honest , er I anticipated all sorts of revelations to b have been made but er they did n't appear . 
237390:64	###I am a Treasurer who likes to keep hold of the money , I like to receive it , I do n't like to give it out . ###It reminds me of the words of Robbie Burns , oh would the Gods the gift to gi us , to see ourselves as others see us . 
237397:12	###No-one could have tended and him night and day in his illness as she did . ###, you are with us today and I assure you that all members of of Council join me in conveying our love , affection and good wishes to you . 
237405:53	###Well done ###I 'm always willing to stand down if somebody can claim to be a little older . 
237409:75	###To them I 'll say you 'll find things are strange for a time but , with the help of your colleagues , you 'll soon find your feet but , for yourselves , avoid falling into the bad habits of others . ###And resolve to take an active part in the in this chamber , but in particular in committee and sub-committees where the real work takes place . 
237421:58	###For the people of this city like to meet and greet the Lord Mayor and the Lady Mayoress , we will strive to meet as many people in all walks of life as possible . ###During the past year , a difficult year , we have seen the beginnings of change taking place .

237816:7	###The opposite is so limp that I 'm becoming paranoid , I 'm developing a twitch , Councillor . ###I wonder what it could be ? 
237949:41	###It was the Tories that hijacked Percent for Art and brought the issue of disability about . ###hear hear 
237970:7	###Conferences solemnly debate the environment but the environment is not just about the North Pole or the ozone layer . ###It 's about what 's happening in our everyday lives , down the street , round the corner , including , and especially including civic art and architecture which , above all , could relate to the real lives of the community . 
237973:29	###Percentage for Art and the people behind it believe it 's time th the time has come for art to go on the offensive . ###Art is green . 
238440:5	###Lord Mayor it is clear that this country cannot sustain the present numbers of applicants seeking asylum . ###We simply cannot allow immigration control to become optional . 
238553:76	###That is , refusing to pay their community charge . ###A massive twelve point four million pounds is now owed by the non-payer to the law abiding citizens of Bradford . 
238553:81	###That is , refusing to pay their community charge . ###A massive twelve point four million pounds is now owed by the non-payer to the law abiding citizens of Bradford . 
238561:72	###And is Councillor k does Councillor intend to pay his debts this year ? ###Lord Mayor , I 'll tell you a small story . 
238563:51	###At one of our constituency surgeries , a retired widow came in to see us concerning the seventeen pounds extra which she would have to pay extra er to cover the other non-payments . ###She announced her intention to deduct this er this amount from the total and to send the balance . 
238575:52	###National minimum wage , of which has said , the employment consequences would be little short of disastrous and the society backs estimates that up to eight hundred thousand jobs could be destroyed by the minimum wage and of the A E U described the minimum wage as nonsense and said he was flatly opposed to it 's introduction in the private sector . ###The result , the result of such claims will be a rush to restore differentials and a general inflation in Local Authorities , with no increase in value of services for the community and I ask that the Labour Party should distance itself from this very mis-guided proposal for national wage proposals , minimum national wage proposals . 
238590:28	###It was not money that the joint bodies did not require or need . ###It was money that the five leaders withdrew and the results have been cuts that threaten the closure of household waste sites in and in . 
238598:103	###It is interesting , is n't it , that er I knew the road to Damascus was long , but I did n't realise it were that long cos on the second of July the Tories moved an amendment at P and R criticising us for spending money on the Lord Mayor 's car , but I 'm glad to see that you 've come back to the fold . ###I think what is interesting , though , is that if you look at the two amendments which are on the audit paper , one deals with speculation er proposed by the Tories . 
238607:23	###I submit , my Lord Mayor , that any decline in the Council 's finances , is due primarily to the Tories originally looking for electoral success . ###The electorate rejected them and they put that before the quality services and the social responsibility that we have as Councillors , not just to ourselves and our wards , but to the whole district and the community as Councillor continually reminds us . 
238793:7	###We 're actually talking here about family unit and human rights . ###We 're actually re t talking about reducing the access to justice because if w if these proposals go through , your access to justice will depend on the size of your wallet and it is actually a restriction on liberty . 
238796:10	###This proposal sets a dangerous anti- democratic precedent . ###Now , if we take a look at Council , this Authority that we all know and love so dearly . 
238817:17	###I look forward to that day . ###Councillor 
238825:64	###Quite simply what the Government intend to achieve through the proposed legislation is the introduction of new measures designed to s to halt the systematic abuse of immigration procedures by people who falsely claim asylum in Britain . ###The effect of these new measures will be to allow a substantial acceleration and simplification , which everybody 's been calling for , of decision making in asylum and immigration cases . 
238856:5	###Lord Mayor , it is clear that this country cannot sustain the present numbers of applicants seeking asylum . ###We simply cannot allow immigration control to become optional . 
238886:24	###It costs us more to collect it than we actually get in . ###The second thing we need to do is to lobby for the repeal of the unwinding of the safety net . 
239035:82	###We do appreciate that it is reasonable to impose restrictions on dogs in such areas as children 's playgrounds , flower beds etcetera and we do support the extension of the byelaws relating to dogs fouling footways and grass verges and also the byelaws relating to the removal of canine faeces . ###However , we feel that such measures as those being mooted would only lead to further problems . 
239062:7	###Will the petitioners please come forward ? ###Welcome to the meeting . 
239138:71	###One resident I spoke to , whose house is immediately on the zebra crossing , reports that every day he dreads hearing the squealing of bl brakes and looking out of his window . ###Another local resident has had a child who 's broken he broken his arm on the crossing when a car hit into him . 
239186:60	###God help us when they fail . ###In the cuts in the training budget this year have led to over two hundred trainee places disappearing . 
239213:61	###Seconded Lord Mayor ###My Lord Mayor , the Local Management of Schools scheme er was reviewed first in the light of consultation which went on during its first full year of operation . 
239271:23	###You do in fact remember as c Councillor has said , that when Labour took over and schools were given the chance to change their minds and withdraw at least to change y to change the decision and withdraw from immediate L M S , then half of the schools chose to delay it 's introduction . ###Surely by that time it had become clear that if the Government plans for Local Management were ill-conceived , that the plans for Local Management were ill-conceived and had not been properly thought out . 
239286:26	###Councillor , Councillor ###Thank you Lord Mayor 
239392:7	###But , if as I believe is the case , the scheme fails to attract anybody , then what are the Government 's alternatives ? ###They can either admit they 've made a mistake , or they can make it compulsory . 
239669:34	###The prime responsibility for bringing up children rests with parents . ###This means providing help and support in the home , the provision of day centres and family centres , and all this we do . 
239669:99	###The prime responsibility for bringing up children rests with parents . ###This means providing help and support in the home , the provision of day centres and family centres , and all this we do . 
239671:10	###On the other hand the needs and welfare of the child must be paramount and if a child is deemed to be in danger , or at any particular risk , the child must be removed . ###In the new Act parents can appeal against the child 's removal after seventy two hours . 
239673:52	###Previously they had to wait twenty eight days before doing so . ###Children who do come in to care are placed with other families where possible and again is fortunate in having an experienced network of foster parents and link carers and we ca n't thank them enough . 
239677:42	###I welcome the Labour Party 's proposals to refurbish some of these homes . ###I just hope it 's done quickly . 
239677:57	###I welcome the Labour Party 's proposals to refurbish some of these homes . ###I just hope it 's done quickly . 
239694:197	###Councillor ###Thank you Lord Mayor . 
239710:17	###But what about resources ? ###The first resource I wanna talk about is not the resources , the Local Authority resources , the resources of the family . 
239722:83	###The middle child is severely disabled and necessary d adaptations would cost him three thousand seven hundred , that 's what he 's gotta find , and he cannot afford it , he ca n't afford to borrow that . ###That 's one of the Acts that works against children in need . 
239761:95	###We 've got a lot more to look forward to . ###We 've tried to frame our motion as carefully as we could t so we could actually get support from everybody . 
239766:110	###What the Children Act does at least recognise in the Conservative Government passing the Childrens Act is the importance of Local Government . ###These are very important services and they are placed , just like care in the community will be , when it eventually is put into practice . 
239778:79	###Chairman , I I move that the report of the social services committee regarding the future of the county council 's old persons homes be noted . ###I hope Chairman that er David will listen to the arguments on this because like other members of his group he throws out closure of elderly persons homes , y' know we 've gotta do it , we 've gotta do it something about which he knows absolutely nothing and about which he 's completely wrong .

239799:67	###Well the figures show that assessments of the over provision are incorrect but even had they been correct if circumstances were an over provision comes about not because of an increase in our provision of services , but because of expansion in the private sector . ###Are we supposed simply to abdicate our responsibility and for every new place that 's started in the private sector , we close down a place in our er organisation . 
239811:52	###Of course they ca n't . ###People may put themselves into residential care if they wish they will pay the whole of the bill . 
239821:72	###That we will seek to refurbish the homes which will cost least to refurbish , first . ###That way we will achieve more in the period and for the money that is available . 
239823:7	###That will leave us , presumably at the end of this process with some of the worst homes , which we will then have to decide what to do about . ###So although the Labour group will be moving a reference back of this matter as an amendment . 
239847:19	###You are carrying that number forward . ###Now if you have a rolling programme and you wanna say we refurbish four at a time , roughly I would say fifty beds in these two hundred , give or take some money because they vary . 
239850:91	###Now you count on that but the next vote then comes in and they 're still not available beds are not available in it , and the next four and the next four so you 'll have , for years you 'll have those out of operation would you like to call it that way and out of production . ###Now to weight that and the next one is respite an short stay beds as you mentioned . 
239863:18	###Thank you Mr Chairman . ###For Mr information the vacancies are the difference between the number of beds we maintain and the number of residence we have . 
239863:72	###Thank you Mr Chairman . ###For Mr information the vacancies are the difference between the number of beds we maintain and the number of residence we have . 
239873:7	###Leaving the rest of community care aside , the admissions to our part three E P H s were thirteen in July , twelve in August and in the first twenty eight days of September , just four . ###That 's less than one placement for every ten homes over the quarter , an average of less than ten in total per month . 
239876:51	###Late last year I was accused of scaremongering , dismissive speakers rubbished the remarks of the district auditor , not interested in what he was saying . ###The only thing I could be safely accused of was understating the problem . 
239881:119	###It contains a rolling review precisely so that it should remain a valid basis for whatever tomorrow may bring . ###In truth the rolling review has become a running review circumstances are changing with no respect for the committee cycle . 
239882:28	###In truth the rolling review has become a running review circumstances are changing with no respect for the committee cycle . ###Indeed some of us think we now know what bankers in the republic felt like , if you stand up to make a speech the matter has moved on before you sit down again but I must tell you of the next major problem . 
239884:149	###Flowing from that that which social service must face urgently and that is this . ###From the low admission rate , the nine hundred thousand in our revenue budget which was shown this year as savings , seven hundred thousand of which was met by fudging community care money in June is now short by three hundred thousand so at the end of this year there will be an overspend or rather a loss of income of three hundred thousand which will show up as a deficit on social services budget for this year . 
239891:32	###You 're on time . ###Are controlled and driven by events not by any one party or any parties . 
239897:13	###and gratefully aid that work . ###Mr please . 
239898:38	###Mr please . ###Chairman , I must confess to being erm , to being somewhat pessimistic about this whole er this this whole problem of of the need to refurbish and the need to tackle numbers in our elderly persons homes . 
239905:40	###Why on earth on the twenty fifth of August at the social services committee meeting did Labour put an amendment which accepted that there was a vacancy problem I quote from the Labourer , from from Labour amendment that er we do n't agree to closures , fair enough , that 's your position . ###But that that we ask for an exploration of the feasibility of widening the use of homes into nursing care , very sheltered accommodation , apartment style accommodation etcetera . 
239946:34	###unnamed that is not true and I do agree with Mr that when we make a decision to close some homes that they should be named to avoid the terrible indecision which exists at the moment . ###I 'm sorry Mr has referred to closures in their teens cos this again throws residents and staff into total confusion we 're too early in the programme of community care to know how many homes are going to close . 
239953:39	###Why ca n't you have a flying warden service if you stay in your own home like in warden assisted accommodation . ###I 'd love to see a service where somebody could come and knock on your door in the morning and say are you alright and call again in the evening , just as if you were in warden assisted accommodation . 
239961:93	###The Conservatives have now the Conservatives have now decided that home closure is the thing and you 'd expect them to produce figures to say we 've got to have thirteen or whatever number closed . ###What the , I believe committees have never had and least of all Mr papers produced on behalf of Mr have never had a serious rigorous objective assessment of the vacancy situation of the future which first of all starts from issue a rolling programme of refurbishments that we have n't really seen sight of the of the implications of that on the number of vacancies . 
239963:57	###This has never had it so this as far as I 'm concerned really , the only thing that is needs to be made clear , is that we must accept of principle that 's all we need to reason . ###Mr . 
239963:66	###This has never had it so this as far as I 'm concerned really , the only thing that is needs to be made clear , is that we must accept of principle that 's all we need to reason . ###Mr . 
239964:73	###Mr . ###Er , Professor is right erm there may always be a possibility that at some time er you have to you have to recognise that there may be excess capacity in the system and I I do n't believe that the Labour party is not prepared to recognise that there may well be excess capacity in the system at some time . 
239971:7	###Now I would urge this council that it really is too early in the process for you to start making up your minds about what you 're gonna in future . ###You simply do not have enough data . 
239971:67	###Now I would urge this council that it really is too early in the process for you to start making up your minds about what you 're gonna in future . ###You simply do not have enough data . 
239975:262	###Near time ###close , I can assure you Chairman recognise the time , I can assure you Chairman that our social workers when doing assessments will not , because I 've had this from them , at grass roots level in a branch local party meeting , that our social workers will not indicate to those people who they 've assessed that there are vacancies in those homes . 
239989:47	###Now if we are going to say that this rolling programme , we we do n't mean this rolling programme because it it 's all going back to committees again to be to be looked at then we are putting our at a disadvantage they will disband and the cost to us for refurbishment will increase . ###It 's essential that in the terms of the er report from the social service committee that we work , we work to the framework within that report . 
240016:109	###Chair , sorry right , I I 've I I 've do n't very often . ###It 's gone , it 's gone I do n't very often agree with Professor erm I very often do n't agree with David either but I 've got to admit that I agree with both of them today , we 've got to make haste slowly on this one . 
240020:98	###If the government gets its way and starts slapping seventeen and a half percent , twenty percent V A T on fuel , we might need some more residential places you do n't know . ###If the figures that we 've been given the recent figures , cos w I 've been working on figures for August up to August but now we 've got even better figures . 
240034:35	###What are we basing them on ? ###I want to see , I 'm I mean I saw Mr and erm Mr nodding when Martin said he wanted to give these figures to the Chief Exec and ask him to er get it sorted out . 
240046:10	###They were not supplied ###And orders from you , yep . 
240046:21	###They were not supplied ###And orders from you , yep . 
240062:74	###So Chair , I will second these resolut , the the amendment . ###Mr 
240083:62	###I 'm aware as everybody else is , that we could do the sort of sweepstake that we carry out on th , what time the meeting 's gonna close and everybody can just put down how ###many times the the airport money had been spent . 
240084:12	###many times the the airport money had been spent . ###But the real fact is if this council regards elderly persons homes as the priority it pretends then it has to be the first priority for that money . 
240099:13	###than we 're presented with in the reports , he does it all the time Chairman . ###As for Mr we 're out of recession are we ? well if that 's an excuse for saying let 's close homes well , I think that 's a a terrible shame , all he , the certainty that he wants to offer to our elderly people is the certainty that their home will close and they 'll be thrown out of it . 
240101:14	###People really do have to understand the trauma we are talking about with moving people out of homes , the trauma that moving them out for refurbishment is bad enough . ###But telling them that they will not move back is even worse . 
240163:50	###He 's repeated his concern to us regularly for eight years eight years . ###I 've no difficulty in seeing why he 's concerned er because I 've seen the figures and examine the situation in in great detail . 
240200:20	###Mr . ###Mr Chairman , I I welcome this opportunity er of of saying just a very brief word about fire service because as a new member I think one of the services that this county has er er is top in is the fire service . 
240206:15	###It is very important this is done , we can join the raffle for the East Midlands airport and I 'll tell you this I will help you pick out the winning ticket er but we cannot use the East Midlands airport money for revenue to run the stations . ###To often we have heard of buildings that have been put under capital expenditure and then the revenue has not been available for their use . 
240217:98	###Now both of these costs were fine , if this is your priority it 's alright . ###I hope you 'll pick out what 's got to come from the East Midlands National airport , can I remind you that a list of that has already been made and passed by this council when there was not a Conservative majority and that had on it about seventy traffic calming schemes bottlenecks 'll be done all over this county which in themselves save accidents and save lives . 
240252:73	###Thank you very much . ###Would those in favour of the amendment I 'm very sorry but er it 's not an automatic right , sorry , I 'd like to have called him but er we 've summed up , what do we do now ? 
240293:7	###Now you say well why do a U-turn I see no reason why because they done a few U-turns on the child benefit they done a U-turn , they picked it up and then blocked it . ###Charging pensioners and children for medical prescriptions picked that one up and dropped it like a hot potato and charging for hospital treatment and why so why not do a U-turn on on this one ? 
240302:205	###The serious item of news situ at the moment one day . ###Mr . 
240319:32	###The second fact issued before us and it 's one that I referred to er when we did it , debated this last time is that if members do take seriously the whole question of ###Near time 
240334:7	###Now the system at the moment seems to be er suggested by the government that V A T should go up and those that really need the money will be if not wholly , mainly compensated , they will of course get another rise if the cost of living goes up because their pensions will go up . ###This is not er protecting that , no old age pensioner should pay these taxes they should pay the taxes unless they 're in need and be adequately taken care of . 
240339:17	###I do n't know why we 're different except that someone wants to makes some trouble . ###If we come into line with Europe , le Europe will soon be putting pressure on us by having a common policy and the policy to save fossil er burning of fossil fuels is international . 
240339:48	###I do n't know why we 're different except that someone wants to makes some trouble . ###If we come into line with Europe , le Europe will soon be putting pressure on us by having a common policy and the policy to save fossil er burning of fossil fuels is international . 
240342:258	###If you remember you did say that . ###Er it 's perf altered a little now because it 's not very popular but that 's what you 've said . 
240347:79	###There is a sense of er deja vu about all of this is n't there . ###One seems to have heard it all and I 'm sure you 've heard before that I 've , I 've to say . 
240348:15	###One seems to have heard it all and I 'm sure you 've heard before that I 've , I 've to say . ###Er , I wondered about this erm this Tory high flyer , about whom er , my friend over there speaks with such admiration and envy , he must have a tremendous influence because I wonder , had he been the mover behind the fact that this V A T on fuel is is there in every other country in Europe including Ireland where it 's about eleven percent . 
240368:168	###But I mean these , these surveys have indicated that the general public is quite prepared to give that little bit extra through direct t , through direct taxation , well listen , you you guys ca n't speak much after all there 's only thirty one of you and there 's thirty seven of us here let 's face it . ###Not idiosyncratic . 
240368:185	###But I mean these , these surveys have indicated that the general public is quite prepared to give that little bit extra through direct t , through direct taxation , well listen , you you guys ca n't speak much after all there 's only thirty one of you and there 's thirty seven of us here let 's face it . ###Not idiosyncratic . 
240391:75	###You were condemned of people then you could n't care a damn about it cos you could n't do anything about it because your methods of running a country was a waste of time . ###Er , so as far as I 'm concerned and I 'm sure as far as you 're concerned , we are battling this together . 
240450:12	###I am delighted to announce that we will soon manufacturing ovens at our Hygena factory in Stockton extending the range of products manufactured in-house follows on naturally as M F I 's position as the leading ah retailer of built-in kitchen appliances . ###These new appliances will replace products imported from Europe and will retailed in our stores from Spring nineteen ninety five . 
240478:67	###yes that 's ###and I was wondering if you could tell us a bit more about these Homework how they fit the M F I the plan of shopping 
240483:9	###So what bits are more up market more down market ###what would you say about that 
240567:17	###Apologies , er Virginia and Jess . ###And so here this rural craft er thing which I wrote for which you asked me which is arriving from the last minutes , is I 'll read it out to you . 
240568:35	###And so here this rural craft er thing which I wrote for which you asked me which is arriving from the last minutes , is I 'll read it out to you . ###All work on display must be British of origin . 
240570:16	###We appreciate that raw materials may be foreign but it must not exceed thirty five percent of the finished product . ###This rule is being rigorously enforced this year . 
240571:17	###This rule is being rigorously enforced this year . ###Work outside these limits must be removed . 
240582:86	###Yes well when you were n't here last time , ###Mm . 
240590:19	###I do n't know it 's just ###I think we sent the copy to Jess and Jess I think has the copy . 
240611:60	###was going to bring them today . ###Because she only rang up very shortly before the meeting saying that she could n't come . 
240613:13	###It 's er er somebody on business is visiting and they the wife has come and she has to entertain the wife . ###Er something she did n't expect and that 's why she could n't come . 
240637:20	###Did very well there , getting on for five hundred pounds . ###But everything is harder you know , everything is harder . 
240781:145	###So I think it 's a good thing to offer it . ###And people might actually decide to buy crackers . 
240806:49	###So they 're getting this whole pack which I hope will pay . ###Now do you know , could you do me a favour and tell Wendy about that gust because she 's just just sending them off . 
240842:24	###Ah let 's ask Wendy . ###Yellow Pages , we pay two hundred and ninety three , three hundred pounds . 
240852:33	###But it does n't matter does it whether we make Christmas crackers or wedding crackers . ###We do n't mind as long as we make I mean I prefer this because it is to order , we do n't make them to stock . 
240902:15	###That 's the one that 's the one danger that I see , that instead of being led by the turnover of the product , we 're being led by the funding we can obtain which I think is a is a weakness in the system . ###It is not really because I was just Noel and I just had a chat this morning . 
240903:9	###It is not really because I was just Noel and I just had a chat this morning . ###I think you have to appreciate here that what we are doing is mainly therapy . 
240904:12	###I think you have to appreciate here that what we are doing is mainly therapy . ###And we must make it pay as much as we can . 
240907:15	###I mean the product might might work for you and me and it might not it will work the same for them , even if we try our hardest . ###And but as we were saying earlier on , the work in itself is a therapy and that will need funding and we are a charity . 
240965:13	###So therefore that you need what you need is a clear understanding ###Yeah . 
240982:10	###Is she going to follow it up ? ###Yes well she 's definitely I mean she 's ordered . 
240993:53	###We have n't got the money at the moment we have ###Well that that that 's the that this is the real crunch . 
240996:7	###The criteria is I think , will somebody give us the funding to do this ? ###Now I mean I would hate to use the money we 've got . 
240999:17	###Well then I should let that be your criteria then erm ###Yes because at the end of the day 
241023:59	###Because all our funding is in a way allocated is n't it . ###Erm I mean in another year er hopefully it comes out of the profit margin . 
241025:94	###I mean eventually eventually , sooner or later and it might be later if somebody else will still it has to come out of the profit margin . ###But it 's a chicken and the egg . 
241058:16	###I do n't know we could look into that . ###Should we would you like Ian , Zain and I and does anybody else want to be involved . 
241075:9	###But if but if Emmy gets the funding nothing to worry about . ###No that 's true . 
241078:34	###But I had had quite er if you want funding erm there 's only so many people out there , you better make a success of what you 're doing . ###Er if you want to go back to the same people . 
241109:20	###Sorry ? ###It 's costly too . 
241117:68	###And you ca n't expand that more . ###You know there is a limit to how far you get . 
241181:150	###And it does cost you . ###You know you can easily spend three hundred pounds er doing that . 
241185:26	###I mean at the end of the year , we need to have sold a Because these people , they need to come for funding purposes . ###I ca n't I ca n't lay off . 
241186:45	###I ca n't I ca n't lay off . ###Because that 's the whole object , they have to come . 
241187:59	###Because that 's the whole object , they have to come . ###They 're churning out crackers and they 're churning them out and they have to be sold . 
241188:9	###They 're churning out crackers and they 're churning them out and they have to be sold . ###And at the end of the year , today in a year , we will sit here and we have to have sold it . 
241192:44	###Erm then It is though let me just say quickly It is a recognized fact for weddings that you do sell through the magazines . ###The brides as I say , nothing is too much trouble for them . 
241192:61	###Erm then It is though let me just say quickly It is a recognized fact for weddings that you do sell through the magazines . ###The brides as I say , nothing is too much trouble for them . 
241219:18	###Mm yeah . ###This is why and one of the the real problems with this is it 's not that I 'm criticising , it 's just that if in fact you 've got somebody who was appointed as a treasurer , you can in fact get more information out of it , instead of having to guess what we got from where and how it came in . 
241225:15	###It does n't change the bottom line . ###It does n't change it it does n't matter so much , the only thing is it 'll be interest how many people came . 
241229:13	###let 's put it that way . ###Yes . 
241258:7	###I 've lost my ###Are we still at the erm trading accounts for the Christmas Fair or have we move on ? 
241291:40	###Now Wendy is struggling hard with the book-keeping . ###And with the er stock control . 
241291:75	###Now Wendy is struggling hard with the book-keeping . ###And with the er stock control . 
241305:103	###But it 's mainly to erm present it to this committee , the trial balance sheet , She does n't quite know how to do that and altogether she feels she just wants she says , how she 's doing it now , at least she wants to check out with somebody , is she doing it how they would do it . ###So she 's going for a day there . 
241318:45	###And she 's paid for eleven hours . ###And she 's working very hard I mean , wh yesterday she was here at six o' clock , so I was long home and Wendy rang from here and she was still here . 
241320:23	###So please will you consider for three months out of our funds which has to be the to pay her that amount of money or else we cannot cope . ###Because I ca n't take it off her , I do n't know how to do it . 
241321:12	###Because I ca n't take it off her , I do n't know how to do it . ###Nobody is there who can She has to do it . 
241323:41	###But she also has to learn it . ###And it 's asking too much at the moment . 
241331:80	###Oh yes . ###Oh yes . 
241343:10	###So you 're saying after three months the work will get ###Easier hopefully . 
241344:20	###Easier hopefully . ###We will have to see . 
241345:7	###We will have to see . ###See at the moment she has to learn about TAS you know . 
241347:10	###She had to learn about accountancy , ###Mm . 
241356:48	###Mm . ###And I think she 'll still do lots of time on top . 
241367:18	###Yeah . ###Or or the rest I mean in general 
241369:11	###You know er it has to come really out of the Christmas Fair or Sir ' s donations , something unallocated . ###We have the money . 
241399:88	###Wendy will do the computer bit and they 'll do the counting bit . ###That kind of thing . 
241401:7	###And erm somebody like Mike of Chris is perfectly capable of get their bits of paper to check to tick off things like that but Wendy will have to check it and put it you know they could do some of the legwork but not yet . ###No . 
241413:32	###You see this is what we have n't got at the moment . ###Erm we need erm this er trial balance sheet , I recommend every second committee making which makes it every three months . 
241413:123	###You see this is what we have n't got at the moment . ###Erm we need erm this er trial balance sheet , I recommend every second committee making which makes it every three months . 
241439:14	###Can I just quickly erm I know what you mean I know what you mean . ###sometimes it 'll look worse than it is . 
241511:27	###It 's I would like to spend some money , can I mention that now then ? ###I 'm trying to I 'm trying to tie this this erm 
241547:66	###No . ###Right . 
241600:19	###You add it up and there 's ten pounds missing . ###And everybody says , Well I gave you a hundred , I gave him five , you 
241609:7	###Right erm . ###Ian Ian Ian 's going to be best at it . 
241615:36	###Well no we 're not saying any such thing , we 're saying that this format is not very helpful and that Wendy is learning , is going to learn format that is better . ###And who is deciding on the format ? 
241617:9	###There is a set formula to do it and she has to learn it . ###She do n't know how to do it . 
241653:103	###Let me but let me just say one thing . ###I really want you to know what a fantastic job Celia 's done . 
241698:44	###if funding here 'll run to it . ###Because when Margaret gets going we 'll have the good on in the office which super but it would be rather nice to have another one . 
241706:81	###And we 've written back that we might get money from but can we use it for I E buying chairs and other things or for the general welfare . ###And they 've said yes we can keep the money . 
241722:127	###They are these plastic blinds and they need cuttin cutting at the side . ###They 're just venetian 
241755:22	###If you open the front door ###The front door key , close it and then and then resets it . 
241756:10	###The front door key , close it and then and then resets it . ###And I take it it would have to be infrared . 
241761:64	###Erm we have a burglar alarm . ###Well it 's fine as long as you actually tell people . 
241789:7	###Will just switch it off . ###Gets in and switches it off . 
241802:11	###Because you could soon run into five or six hundred quid . ###I know I know . 
241802:26	###Because you could soon run into five or six hundred quid . ###I know I know . 
241814:13	###get costings ###Do you a do you know exactly what it 's going to cost you ? 
241830:18	###Maybe we have yes . ###But we need to check 
241857:59	###And that really it 's all the chairs are good office chairs in there , the tables are bad . ###Right . 
241860:10	###Erm we need tables , I mean chaps like like Mike and Roger with their big legs they just ca n't under them . ###They just ca n't get their knees in . 
241860:28	###Erm we need tables , I mean chaps like like Mike and Roger with their big legs they just ca n't under them . ###They just ca n't get their knees in . 
241861:7	###They just ca n't get their knees in . ###And we have to do that , we must get tables . 
241877:52	###And there was a track , electric track and all that . ###I think er it 's it 's Desmond , why I say no to that , the we Tom and I have measured it out and Celia . 
241883:36	###Now we need an optimistic accountant , can somebody look out for an optimistic accountant ###There is n't such a thing . 
241889:34	###No ###So wh are you saying that all this stuff you want for the admin course , you 're gonna raise money separately or do you want to 
241900:8	###Yeah . ###The other thing is , you know Noel came , they had some money , what do you want , actually I could ask them because he also said things . 
241903:94	###A long one . ###The point is 
241905:21	###that this will happen , people will come to us occasionally and say , do you need money for what specific and I think , as a committee we must have a future , a list for the future of things we might want and also of ideas we have . ###Like now luckily I had these two ideas running in my head anyhow . 
241905:45	###that this will happen , people will come to us occasionally and say , do you need money for what specific and I think , as a committee we must have a future , a list for the future of things we might want and also of ideas we have . ###Like now luckily I had these two ideas running in my head anyhow .

241922:10	###Yeah . ###set aside an amount of money or identified that we would need to spend an amount of money and perhaps we need to do that sooner . 
241938:38	###The lady who I was trying to get hold of who 's actually got the contract that er we want amended , for some reason I . ###I did try , I was gonna try before I came here but I was . 
241946:35	###Before Christmas . ###No no er the money had been sanctioned long long time November , it was October . 
241971:10	###I just hope Virginia does n't get Ah yes , I 'm going to Germany . ###You could have one committee meeting without me then . 
241985:33	###You ca n't come on a Wednesday . ###Which day can you come ? 
241994:78	###You know . ###It 's probably going to get harder . 
242005:10	###Switch this off shall I . ###It 's still going round . 
242468:10	###And I think if you look at lessons such as the Cambridge situation , you can have distances of separation between a new village and surrounding settlements and it 's as little as six hundred metres , depending on localized matters . ###And my view is that within the A sixty four corridor , north east , there is sufficient range of sites to be found that it should not be erm set to one side on this criterion . 
242502:14	###Can we move on to minerals considerations ? ###Erm and we come back to the County 's wording which is , avoid conflict between mineral and non- mineral development . 
242528:23	###However they do go into the balance . ###It 's quite clear from the British Coal letter that there is extreme concern about by the operator of the coalfield about the effect of any new settlement along either the A nineteen south or the A sixty four south corridor . 
242541:23	###The other one , vaguely at the back of my mind it was raised this morning cos I recall Mr made a comment on it , and that is erm looking at the growth implications beyond two thousand and six . ###Are there any sectors where that may be acceptable or unacceptable ? 
242589:31	###Which brings me really to the factors which I give the most weight to . ###Most im Very importantly , it is the area where I think there 's agreement almost around the table that it is it will be the area which will best meet the Greater York needs , rather than needs of Leeds or elsewhere in Greater York . 
242649:55	###You sir , I would contend have found at every turn uncertainty amongst the local authorities and a and a lack of unanimity amongst the Greater York authorities as to whether there should be a settlement and where where it should go . ###Which I which we would suggest is indicative of the fact that there is no overriding demand , which is what obviously for the purposes of P P G three , you are looking for . 
242655:15	###Erm a new factory going into the area for example will have a choice between one of Selby 's erm ca n't think of a suitable adjective , large requirement for industrial land , or it will go into the new settlement . ###In our view the the simple fact that Selby are prepared to take it , erm should n't carry that much weight . 
242666:71	###And it 's certainly not available in sufficient detail for for all of the sectors to make a fair comparison and I think Mr has made this point in in when you 've questioned him a number of times today that the information is just not available or to hand to make to make that comparison . ###Erm I I look forward to hearing Mr ' s views on on this particular matter given that he was the or or the department was was responsible for for in a sense prolonging the discussion to consider the breakdown of locations and as to whether he feels that there is sufficient technical information available on all of the sectors should a recommendation come forward for a particular sector from from the panel . 
242775:72	###Sorry . ###, D O E. Er I 'm sure that members of the panel appreciate why I 've remained silent during the discussion of item two D , but does anyone in the room who does n't fully understand , it 's simply that the Secretary of State of exercises role in relation to a new settlement . 
242813:19	###Mm . ###if nothing for the fact that the message that is coming home loud and clear is this request for clarification , the advent of certainty , one way or another . 
242844:29	###First there 's the idea it is a place where people live . ###Er it is not an industrial estate in the open countryside . 
242849:44	###Or that perhaps two or three dwellings together necessarily constitutes a settlement . ###But I think that is very much a question of personal perception . 
242897:9	###But p up to ten miles , that takes you outside the limit and if if you have a new settlement for up to fourteen hundred clients , that patiently takes you outside the Greater York Area as defined by your study . ###Yes indeed it does erm 
242934:9	###If as I suspect from what Mr has said that that the there is some reluctance to start revamping the Greater York in quotes figures . ###Yes ? 
242935:7	###Yes ? ###Then we have to revamp . 
242956:136	###We 'll have an adjourn we 'll adjourn until half past ten , so you 've all got chance to read this . ###Can we can we now recommence please . 
242961:14	###So with that we proceed into er looking at H two . ###Can I say that we ourselves have also been drafting a set of criteria , er taking on board the various points that were made on Friday morning . 
242961:103	###So with that we proceed into er looking at H two . ###Can I say that we ourselves have also been drafting a set of criteria , er taking on board the various points that were made on Friday morning . 
242966:14	###And certainly in terms of the sec the sector approach , the one which erm Mr has produced is als almost coterminous with the with the way in which we wanted to look at it . ###Now can I ask first of all , are you , as we have a paper in front of us , are you happy to continue the discussion of the basis of the sector by sector approach , and in particular the sectors which have been identified by Mr ? 
242967:13	###Now can I ask first of all , are you , as we have a paper in front of us , are you happy to continue the discussion of the basis of the sector by sector approach , and in particular the sectors which have been identified by Mr ? ###Cos that I must say that was the way in which we would have wished to have proceeded with the discussion . 
243024:14	###Yes , yes yeah ###I think 
243037:130	###There is one criterion which erm I 'm not clear about whether Mr has included or not . ###And then question of beyond two thousand and six . 
243081:13	###Yeah . ###Well if you turn back to the various sectors . 
243081:41	###Yeah . ###Well if you turn back to the various sectors . 
243084:9	###But can I just refer you back to the words of P B G three where it says quite clearly in paragraph thirty three . ###The proposal is a clear expression of local preference , supported by local planning authorities . 
243131:51	###Mr , I turn to you for guidance on that one . ###Again sir . 
243153:85	###But Mr , sorry to come in . ###As I read five . 
243169:10	###The one three six three goes out through the Sutton on Forest on Forest does it ? ###Sutton on Forest , yeah . 
243169:95	###The one three six three goes out through the Sutton on Forest on Forest does it ? ###Sutton on Forest , yeah . 
243239:25	###And really I 'm looking to here . ###What does it mean ? 
243250:36	###Mm . ###Yeah . 
243255:13	###Mr . ###I shall do my best to answer the questions , chairman . 
243276:17	###Now as for the difference between county and district , Mr ' s point is a very very valid one . ###They 're the authority charged with producing a strategic plan for the area . 
243277:32	###They 're the authority charged with producing a strategic plan for the area . ###In that obviously they have to take on board the views of their constituent districts . 
243280:38	###So in theory it 's possible for the county solution at the end of the day to be not completely in line with what its constituent districts think . ###Aha . 
243282:45	###The Secretary of State , I 'm sure would would obviously have to take on board what was embodied in the final structure plan . ###But I think in deciding his actions before the actual approval of the plan , he would ne need to take on board any difference of opinion between the county and district on an issue of this kind . 
243474:10	###Mr ###Sir . 
243520:70	###Being in a location where people wish to live . ###Because that 's really erm a part of what I mean by this criterion . 
243601:30	###Erm I would n't want to erm to go through this this exercise scoring two ticks , two crosses er on on on each of the sectors . ###A because the work has n't been done What I 'm trying to do is er to say give a balanced approach which seems to me to reflect the County Council 's view that er you really ca n't do it on the basis of a a a quick subjective assessment , it really needs to be the result of a l of a detailed body of work . 
243601:91	###Erm I would n't want to erm to go through this this exercise scoring two ticks , two crosses er on on on each of the sectors . ###A because the work has n't been done What I 'm trying to do is er to say give a balanced approach which seems to me to reflect the County Council 's view that er you really ca n't do it on the basis of a a a quick subjective assessment , it really needs to be the result of a l of a detailed body of work .

243610:134	###Erm er to pick up on what Mr said , I think it 's important to differentiate between the local employment requirements of the new settlement and the strategic employment question . ###Mr implies that a location to the South of York er would actually be better in strategic employment terms . 
243706:10	###Around Tadcaster . ###Yes I I erm I I I certainly do er and 
243707:112	###Yes I I erm I I I certainly do er and ###I I have to 
243740:29	###They also I suspect , not having seen it . ###C just to be accurate on the status of the the the document . 
243768:40	###Erm it 's also the infrastructure that will be required by such a settlement . ###Much of the erm sector which is east of the A sixty four is very isolated from existing roads and the only access into that area is over the A sixty four or from the A sixty four . 
243797:102	###Our landscape has concluded that there could be no no prospect of any damage to form the O A O M D i if there is development in this this sector . ###We are talking about s several miles ma ' am and I can I ca n't just conceive of i of how that could could occur . 
243798:83	###We are talking about s several miles ma ' am and I can I ca n't just conceive of i of how that could could occur . ###And ma ' am on a further point which I think is very significant when you 're dealing with proposals in the A sixty four south of York , is you have to take into account not only the impact of the new settlement itself , but the impact of associated infrastructure . 
243888:83	###This er a question that Mr raised last Thursday of Friday and which I thought I 'd clarified Leeds position on . ###We we draw a clear distinction between provision in Craven , Harrogate , Hambledon where constraint was suggested spread over fifteen years on dispersed housing sites . 
243888:102	###This er a question that Mr raised last Thursday of Friday and which I thought I 'd clarified Leeds position on . ###We we draw a clear distinction between provision in Craven , Harrogate , Hambledon where constraint was suggested spread over fifteen years on dispersed housing sites . 
243908:22	###There are people who commute to Leeds from very distant positions , but they are penny numbers . ###And the greater the distance , the greater the the travel time , the fewer people make that journey . 
243956:71	###Erm the City Council does act as agent for the highway authority within the City of York and actually maintains a a tra transportation model er in conjunction with the County Council with the County Surveyor . ###Clearly you understand from my comments last week , we consider any of the any of the options be to be bad in terms of their traffic impact on the City . 
243965:24	###Having examined the various sectors er we 've come to the view that there are three sectors which are least worst in that effect , erm which is the north east sector , south east and the south west . ###In terms of the impact they have on the traffic system in the city . 
243966:108	###In terms of the impact they have on the traffic system in the city . ###The difference between them is I have to admit at this level , relatively marginal in terms of er which is the worst and which is the best between the three . 
243972:139	###So that 's our assessment in terms of the the highway impact . ###Can I just comment on the on the other two criteria while I 'm speaking sir to help you ? 
244047:24	###The t turning to the other sectors , it 's quite correct there is capacity there is there is scope for example along the A fifty nine corridor , for new stations . ###But there is no scope along the A sixty four south . 
244085:7	###And it is it seems to me quite within the realms of possibility that erm highway erm criteria will change and the need for upgrading of the roads would be reviewed and perhaps a different system erm of er judging them er would produce a different set of or a different improvement regime . ###Thank you I I have no other points Unless a has anybody got wants to pursue the communications issue after when when we reconvene at five thirty , otherwise I 'm quite happy . 
244093:12	###Thank you . ###The item or the issue for discussion this afternoon is Is there a need for an A fifty nine , A sixty one , Harrogate relief road ? 
244093:34	###Thank you . ###The item or the issue for discussion this afternoon is Is there a need for an A fifty nine , A sixty one , Harrogate relief road ? 
244269:18	###Can I ask Mr , leaving aside the question of where it is , do you accept that there is a need for an improvement of the A fifty nine ? ###Yes . 
244345:17	###I have n't presented those in my in my statements ###Sorry read those . 
244356:133	###If that satisfied Mr . ###It 's simply the reason it was done that way was to reflect a County Council decision which had been taken fairly recent times on the route of an outer as opposed to an inner . 
244405:149	###It seems to me that the indication you have given on the key diagram to alteration number three for Harrogate Knaresborough is exactly the same as for example the indication given for York and for Harrogate Knaresborough southern on the approved key diagram . ###What 's the change you 're offering ? 
244455:7	###When you say the County Council is committed to the northern or the outer relief road route , do you mean committed or do you mean that that is their preferred option . ###That is their preferred option which I am instructed er to to pursue . 
244458:19	###There is and the County Council has indicated that if circumstances change , er then it can look at this again . ###So in terms of commitment er County Councils can always look at the the route , it can always change its mind . 
244663:26	###Because on the evidence before us it seems to me it 's hard to understand why they went that way . ###I 've stolen Mr ' s thunder I think . 
244688:35	###I think if the road was drawn very closely in to the greenbelt edge then that could have an effect on development pressures and it could lead to pressures for erm some er amendment the greenbelt boundary in in the future erm of plan making processes . ###What are the Borough Council 's views about relative preference to inner and outer ? 
244694:40	###Is that a good thing ? ###In itself in providing a greater degree of traffic relief Yes it I mean it is a good thing , it is a plus point . 
244785:7	###Right . ###The second point is about the public consultation exercise . 
244800:17	###clearly said that in the ###Right . 
244800:28	###clearly said that in the ###Right . 
244802:28	###in the information so we had to we had to assume one for the purpose of public consultation but we said that the final decision on standards would be taken er in another time . ###Yeah . 
244897:21	###Yeah . ###rather than I think differentiate the sort of primary . 
244919:96	###there and perhaps coming on to the Residents ' Association point that made in their proof , that our forecasts actually show that on balance , er er there would be an increase in flow in fact on the on that route as it approaches the A sixty one . ###That what you get in terms of the the effect is that some traffic er will go out to use er the western relief road , to head north or south , and will no longer use the road to get into Harrogate . 
244920:77	###That what you get in terms of the the effect is that some traffic er will go out to use er the western relief road , to head north or south , and will no longer use the road to get into Harrogate . ###Er particular there is er a commercial business area at Harlow c court er located on the the western fringe er which clearly at the moment , a lot of our traffic will have to use Road to get into Harrogate and to access to the A sixty one . 
244964:96	###Er and you actually acknowledged my comments about the hairpin bends and the crossroads . ###And is is not a fact that in fact the Killinghall bypass and the Ripon bypass , in fact does nothing to in fact i er alleviate those particular problems over about a seven mile stretch . 
245028:167	###Yeah certainly sir . ###The er the first point as i understand is is with regard to use of the the A six five eight , A fifty nine , A one as opposed to the er using a western relief road , that being er a more appropriate route . 
245092:22	###I have tried to e ascertain which particular diagram in this report Mr was quote quoting from . ###I think I I 've found the report er the particular map . 
245131:18	###Now you know , having said that I accept that if we did a peak hour model and an off peak model we would have shown different effects . ###it 's a more broad brush appro approach . 
245150:50	###The present road and I do n't want to get into the detail of it but relate it to environmental costs against the so called benefits , would in fact cut right through there with a viaduct and it would actually start of on something like a twenty seven foot emba er a twenty seven foot high embankment and with a fifty four deep cutting . ###And what I would like to ask in in this environmental age that we live in , for a benefit to the people on the A sixty one , for a vehicle every four point eight seconds instead of every three point five seconds , using your own figures , how can you justify and quantify the cost of the environmental damage that will be done to what is regarded as the finest visual attractive side of Harrogate . 
245175:69	###I take it that you 're not disputing then that the change in the traffic flows that I 've indicated would actually what would be achieved ? ###Well I do n't dispute , I 've no information myself . 
245175:147	###I take it that you 're not disputing then that the change in the traffic flows that I 've indicated would actually what would be achieved ? ###Well I do n't dispute , I 've no information myself . 
245185:58	###And if I may Mr chairman , something that 's happened in the last few days , that 's er evident that er the been the first satellite survey in this country ever which is now beginning to show to the nation , just in fact the damage that roads have been doing and that there 's in fact now some suggestion from government that they may be rethinking some elements of these roads , because the environmental impact has not really been taken into account as effectively before . ###No I 'm saying precisely the opposite , David , Harrogate Borough Council . 
245271:32	###I accept that . ###it 's very clear , that 's right at the bottom end of what they think should be recorded and until this recent manual p was published , it changes that low were not recorded . 
245319:9	###For maybe just a momentary at this moment Mr chairman at this time of day , it 's rather like the carpet salesman saying to the lady , which one do you want , red , blue or green , not whether you want one or not . ###And I 'm actually paraphrasing the chief executive of of North Yorkshire County Council there , Mr when on the two tier government . 
245332:12	###I think we 've got there unless Mr wants to make a response . ###Erm yes I will I will chairman just very briefly . 
245333:51	###Erm yes I will I will chairman just very briefly . ###Erm it has to be said that er new roads do o open up opportunities for development . 
245334:10	###Erm it has to be said that er new roads do o open up opportunities for development . ###We erm we 've been discussing all last week the amount of housing that has to be accommodated in Harrogate District and in North Yorkshire as as a whole . 
245335:29	###We erm we 've been discussing all last week the amount of housing that has to be accommodated in Harrogate District and in North Yorkshire as as a whole . ###We will have to find erm sites for that new housing . 
245341:89	###Er there are two examples along the western route corridor of sites which I do refer to in in the statement , Hildebrand Barracks at , an army camp which er is expected to be vacated in the near future , and Queen Ethelbergers which has been vacant now for for almost two years . ###Erm finding new uses for those built areas is very difficult because of the constraints of access . 
245382:16	###Thank you very much . ###Er the other rule with well method of procedure , most of you know about it , but if you want to attract my attention during the course of the discussion simply put your name board up on end and we can see who wants to speak . 
245382:160	###Thank you very much . ###Er the other rule with well method of procedure , most of you know about it , but if you want to attract my attention during the course of the discussion simply put your name board up on end and we can see who wants to speak . 
245438:7	###I think I would submit that there is n't really a strategic gap . ###There may have been one or two planning applications which have been a little bit difficult to deal with but that 's life surely . 
245448:51	###Now it may well be that er the Federation of Hambleton disagree about what the importance of of that landscape assessment is precisely . ###But nevertheless it 's been done and the debate can be held under the auspices of the District Plan . 
245449:25	###But nevertheless it 's been done and the debate can be held under the auspices of the District Plan . ###We are n't prevented from having the debate and indeed in having that debate Hambleton will have to prove they 've made drawn the right boundaries . 
245456:30	###And in fact the intention would be in effect that this will in fact like greenbelt and I would point to the Harrogate District er Harrogate Rural Area Study and er that 's been submitted by Harrogate Council as an example of er showing that that is the precise intention of this sort of policy . ###Because even in the absence of strategic guidance in the past it has n't stopped local authorities actually bringing forward policies in their local plans . 
245457:10	###Because even in the absence of strategic guidance in the past it has n't stopped local authorities actually bringing forward policies in their local plans . ###The difference is , of course , that those policies have got to be tested if each individual case appropriateness and er I I do feel that if we have a blanket policy then we wo n't be able to test it . 
245462:48	###But there 's no , it seems to me there 's no fundamental change in Government policy and if you are only bringing forward er a change in policy er to this alteration on the basis that er there was some extra P P G guidance we would n't just be dealing with countryside policy here we would be dealing with a policy about telecommunications , wind farms , a whole raft of things er which which we ought to be really dealing with . ###It may be at the end of end of all this that you you are nevertheless convinced that there ought to be a policy . 
245466:79	###But it does seem to be again if we 're going back to Government guidance who are justifying extra policies to be brought forward to this alteration , it is a serious omission this alteration that there is no policy which deals with rural affordable housing . ###Surely that has been one of the major changes of Government policy over the last few years . 
245531:9	###Explicitly Government policy to the opposite . ###So it seemed to me , sir , that we need a very very special justification for this all embracing E two policy which brings me to the other thing to say about it as a general principle . 
245592:33	###Well the plain fact of the matter was Chairman there were there were none to quote to him and erm we see the the structure plan Policy E two er as fulfilling a bridging role between national policy and the more specific guidance which would necessarily be contained in local plans . ###The county at first stage did try of course to produce some exceptions and and I think all the districts found ones they liked and ones they did n't like and I think quite reasonably the county said well er possibly the role of E two is simply to produce this broad policy goal and er this will er and as Richmondshire see it it 'll be er for us to refine it as we see fit at district level . 
245610:11	###It does n't seem to me from what I read of page thirty one of that inspector 's report that he was in any different position by the absence of the Policy E two than he would be if he 'd got it . ###Yes I it 's a it 's I 've contemplated because at the end of the day any appeal decision was er one in favour of the council 's position . 
245612:89	###Erm and I have to er pick up the point made opposite that the protection has been pretty good over the last few years without the policy . ###That it is simply being this is why we feel that the role of the structure policies is to provide that er into local plan policies . 
245628:102	###We 've erm we 've had quotes from from from Government policies from P P G seven 's been mentioned twice quoting paragraph two point one protection er that the countryside should be safeguarded for its own sake and I know that there is a tendency to quote Government policy to back your own case . ###But erm it it it would seem to me that erm that the the basis of Government policy in writing to the countryside is para one ten of P P G seven , that talks about a balance essentially . 
245672:117	###That 's that 's that 's not that 's not part of part of our er our proposal . ###The proposal really is what er do you have a policy which is not in line with P P G guidance . 
245672:151	###That 's that 's that 's not that 's not part of part of our er our proposal . ###The proposal really is what er do you have a policy which is not in line with P P G guidance . 
245695:121	###Sorry ? ###Michael Feist Countryside Commission York and Humberside Regional Office . 
245764:168	###We 've now moved on in part of question your question five B and erm in my response to that I 'm suggesting , and I hope it 's not just semantics , picking up the point made just before we broke for coffee , is that there 's all sorts of things called the countryside , and this policy is is directed at the open countryside . ###Now I 've heard about you know the question of definition of where the edge of the open countryside is and that 's a valid point but if we if we have in mind the open countryside , it seems to me that P P G seven does clearly differentiate between the countryside , the countryside , rural areas and the open countryside where it refers to development being strictly controlled . 
245765:7	###Now I 've heard about you know the question of definition of where the edge of the open countryside is and that 's a valid point but if we if we have in mind the open countryside , it seems to me that P P G seven does clearly differentiate between the countryside , the countryside , rural areas and the open countryside where it refers to development being strictly controlled . ###Now this phrase strictly controlled erm I I I wanted to ask it myself because I you know trying to push it through to what it actually means I think the county council if you like has taken it at what may be face value and said well strictly controlled must mean something . 
245774:19	###Thank you Chairman . ###Ken Williamson North Yorkshire County Council . 
245855:8	###Such allocation would be contrary to county structure plan Policy E two . ###Now what we could say is well there would be trust . 
245878:108	###Roy Donson House Builders ' Federation . ###I think mo a lot of the points I wanted to make were were covered by Professor Lock but I would just draw the panel 's attention to erm the policy that was rejected . 
245881:31	###I would suggest to you that given that and also the wording in the justification under the old Policy E three , that in fact you could hardly get a tissue paper between this policy that is now before you and the previous policy . ###They are in fact almost one and the same and they use er one and the same justification . 
245890:50	###Erm it seems it seems to me that wha what 's crucial here is the er the spirit behind the policy or or rather the the way in which it 's going to be interpreted . ###And I 'd I 'd like to turn to the point that erm Professor Lock raised in in terms of the potential clash of interest if if you like between the restraint of of the policy and the er the development proposals as regards Sel Selby district . 
245908:59	###I think my impression was that er Professor Lock was suggesting that because of Policy E two local planning authorities would have some difficulty in in making allocations to meet the structure plan requirement . ###Now I do n't think that 's the case . 
245916:18	###You know we 've had intense pressure for development in the countryside , certainly in Harrogate district . ###Erm quite recently , for example , we 've had applications for motorway service areas , that 's just one example . 
245917:16	###Erm quite recently , for example , we 've had applications for motorway service areas , that 's just one example . ###And that sort of application has to be considered in the context of countryside protection policies . 
245931:39	###Within the greenbelt policy there are there is a list of exceptions , a private strategic level . ###I think it is appropriate if you are to have an E two policy it is appropriate to apply restrictions to to identify the exceptions in that . 
245938:7	###The policy does not say that , the policy put a strict limitation on all forms of development . ###As I said earlier I do not think that this is an area where the district councils should be given a completely free rein to interpret the matter within their own local plans . 
245938:109	###The policy does not say that , the policy put a strict limitation on all forms of development . ###As I said earlier I do not think that this is an area where the district councils should be given a completely free rein to interpret the matter within their own local plans . 
245938:211	###The policy does not say that , the policy put a strict limitation on all forms of development . ###As I said earlier I do not think that this is an area where the district councils should be given a completely free rein to interpret the matter within their own local plans . 
246023:37	###Erm and certainly when it comes to local needs housing that is in that is explicitly to be an exception and and erm I I see no particular problem with that . ###And either section fifty four A applies or it does n't . 
246025:31	###I mean it if it applies then the local development plan has to be followed unless material considerations indicate otherwise and among the material considerations explicitly by Government policy is the existence of a local needs housing requirement . ###And so I see no particular problem about the E two in relation to local needs housing policy . 
246080:191	###Mr Earle . ###Thank you Chairman . 
246081:33	###Thank you Chairman . ###Erm the the particular case of Richmondshire having been referred to I I felt I ought to point that er we 're quite content with the concept of Policy E two as giving the strategic weight to the question of protecting the open countryside and the balance , the very difficult balance , decisions that we and other authorities are going to have to come to in preparing our local plan . 
246335:9	###I had the sales force who called in and done a demonstration in a person 's home . ###All right . 
246355:7	###All right . ###It 's all done okay . 
246402:18	###No no you give that product away free . ###Okay but we do n't your the responsibility of the sales consultant here is not to approach the estate agent or the golf to sell that , somebody else does that . 
246571:10	###Yeah that 's right . ###No I do n't think that worry would be there . 
246583:18	###Mhm . ###We did we 've just completed we 've done three or four others . 
246597:13	###Mhm . ###But it would be no good to them and say well you know right in the middle of nowhere , cow er sheep or cow country , there are a number of courses we would n't touch because we would n't be able to get enough sus er you know even with five erm major businesses . 
246600:9	###Right . ###Can I approach my own golf clubs or is that going to be done through you ? 
246617:7	###And you 're saying that one golf course I could be there for two or three weeks ? ###Two to three weeks . 
246659:12	###All right we can give you the we can give you the platform . ###Yes . 
246710:23	###I mean if there are two or three days off during that or one day off you take for instance , as long as it 's fifteen working days . ###Erm and that is to do er one or the other or both . 
246732:4	###Obviously these cards ###Mhm . 
246768:10	###All right until their number comes up as it were . ###Er in the meantime we we leave them erm er a list or a a sheet like or something similar to this , I have n't got one for at the moment , erm asking them to list out all those business with which they have some er may be some link up . 
247011:9	###You 're looking for high fliers and even car firms can go bust the second year . ###track record 
247058:36	###And in fact you will have seen on those cards over there a BUPA hospital . ###Mhm . 
247061:44	###Yes . ###All right . 
247079:14	###Okay . ###I mean 
247093:7	###Basically what I am doing is I want them to reply . ###I have only written the truth in my letter to them . 
247207:10	###I just need you to sign there 's a copy here for your info just need you to sign to say that you understand that . ###Want your pen back now do n't you ? 
247247:14	###Thanks very much . ###Okay good bye . 
247305:34	###Yes yes . ###Oh smashing okay . 
247305:43	###Yes yes . ###Oh smashing okay . 
247348:10	###Erm I I think does but er I do n't think it er became quite the successful initiative that er that they hoped it would be . ###I mean I do think there are limitations with er 
247377:112	###Because here you have an opportunity to go launch yourself onto a self employed erm platform and cannot provide a better platform for that and I would say that would n't I he 's thinking . ###Mm . 
247440:28	###samples and things like that . ###That 's right . 
247451:18	###Yeah . ###erm and certainly it would not have much retention . 
247530:11	###Yes . ###Er but I 'm pretty certain 
247542:9	###Erm we decide which company or which environment which environment you feel you might feel most comfortable within . ###And the third one is when . 
247577:7	###Do n't turn up and do n't call . ###Oh yeah . 
247597:27	###And I do n't seeing any problem at all in you being able to come over well on the phone which is the important thing for us . ###Looking at the environments where do you think you would feel most comfortable ? 
247599:34	###Now I that 's a luxury I have to say that most recruiting people do not get . ###Cert certainly the the opportunity does appear to be er huge in the the practices the medical practices . 
247604:31	###I mean the new areas of course for us er and I still count the medical practices as a new area although it 's been for four years ###Sure sure . 
247632:15	###So once you 've done it you ca n't sell any more even though there are two or three people in the wings saying can I go into it . ###yeah yeah . 
247709:26	###Now that target figure is identified the day you arrive at the erm at the surgery . ###On the documentation that you receive direct from head office . 
247739:73	###And the work downwards . ###If you work if you work on a quarter page at three ninety and cos remember you 're telling all this on the phone . 
247746:58	###If if you really need it to get the deal . ###To push a sale . 
247749:20	###But if you are persistent ###Or a four thousand per that 's the sort of thing . 
247757:19	###Yeah . ###Yeah . 
247764:52	###Could well be . ###Cos you never know . 
247765:142	###Cos you never know . ###One of the things I I I found it very difficult to start with I must admit is that to to prejudge that people would or would not go in . 
247765:178	###Cos you never know . ###One of the things I I I found it very difficult to start with I must admit is that to to prejudge that people would or would not go in . 
247765:233	###Cos you never know . ###One of the things I I I found it very difficult to start with I must admit is that to to prejudge that people would or would not go in . 
247773:8	###Yeah . ###more than a hundred miles . 
247787:9	###Yes right good . ###Now we will pay all those commissions on the basis of you achieving er first of all the sale but also a minimum amount of paper work . 
247787:61	###Yes right good . ###Now we will pay all those commissions on the basis of you achieving er first of all the sale but also a minimum amount of paper work . 
247788:9	###Now we will pay all those commissions on the basis of you achieving er first of all the sale but also a minimum amount of paper work . ###And I have to say that this is the minimum I 've ever seen for a sales person to have to do . 
247790:72	###But it has to be absolutely right . ###Er that which makes it as critical as as a lot of er paper work . 
247813:23	###And you have a little chart to help you do that . ###But if you have n't got one you make it up yourself . 
247814:26	###But if you have n't got one you make it up yourself . ###But the other thing that you have to er be erm very clear about is er on on the monetary side is if there are two signatories to the cheque , right ? both of them need to have signed it . 
247848:14	###But in the main we will lift whatever they want if they 've got something like that in existence if not we 'll do it for them . ###And it 's at no extra cost that 's all built into the price . 
247852:61	###Yeah . ###And that 's because we 've got the the balance of the first year 's payment . 
247852:91	###Yeah . ###And that 's because we 've got the the balance of the first year 's payment . 
247936:10	###And providing all that document done let 's face it it is simple providing you make sure that people er the advertiser knows what you 're what you 're looking for before you go round there then there should n't should n't be too much problem . ###No that 's okay admin does n't hold any terrors for me . 
247937:36	###No that 's okay admin does n't hold any terrors for me . ###Well you have to do it . 
247942:11	###You ca n't change you ca n't change anything on there because the guy 's signed it . ###So once you 've done that in front that 's that out the way , the copy out of the way . 
247952:13	###Okay well I know I know you said that you were looking at one or two other things and quite honestly I would expect you to be . ###Erm 
247969:133	###Anybody over forty I say it is a legitimate time to talk to people about self employment . ###Now erm in the main the most the people who go and talk , if they talk genuinely to their their other half or I always say partner instead of , nowadays that 's politically correct I think , erm then they so they 're they 're a lot of the times they 're talked out of it . 
247988:12	###You 're on the move every three every three weeks you get to know another group of people . ###Mm . 
247988:24	###You 're on the move every three every three weeks you get to know another group of people . ###Mm . 
247990:13	###You do n't have to do n't have to procure my own leads . ###No . 
248037:29	###Right ? ###Okay so that 's in effect the tenth is n't it . 
248069:14	###at some time . ###Now we pay we pick up the tab at the Grand Hotel for those three days in-house . 
248071:56	###Now if we have to send you out fur you know er with a trainer or top person who where you need to stay away we will pay . ###We will always pay your travel costs whichever you know whichever er er second of the training course you 're on . 
248074:48	###Right . ###All right ? 
248110:60	###Ask ask any ###When er when we were on the subject of er the the labour turnover er in the insurance industry , what is the turnover in ? 
248201:32	###Yeah er and er I 'll be quite frank with you erm until I start talking to you in your background would n't come anywhere near what we want . ###And I 'm surprised erm there there is no what I would quote traditional sales er experience . 
248210:53	###So erm excuse me . ###Turn this off a minute . 
248235:24	###You er when it comes to erm er whatever you are selling in tradi what I call traditional and retail sales , so that retail sales sometimes have a price tag up there . ###Yes . 
248302:15	###Yep . ###So it 's very important to get er over that . 
248344:31	###Sure . ###Er but I 've got the potential to make a lot more money as a self employed person . 
248347:56	###Erm your marital status is divorced . ###Mhm yes . 
248360:22	###I 've got to make that money for my kids . ###Yeah . 
248380:14	###Yes that 's right . ###So that does n't present too much of a problem . 
248454:10	###We 're very much a business suite company yeah . ###Yes . 
248476:15	###the contract . ###Yes . 
248487:10	###So there 's no there 's no way round that . ###All right . 
248508:28	###All right fine . ###Yeah . 
248508:52	###All right fine . ###Yeah . 
248543:55	###Yeah . ###Mhm . 
248579:10	###Well yeah I mean ###Well 
248629:24	###Right . ###and if we can get that out of the way . 
248644:13	###and they will then they will say , Not going to do this . ###Mhm . 
248675:12	###Right . ###But that 's provided for you and it is erm it you know certainly the assignments I did on the medical practice they were it was very valuable . 
248685:16	###And there are other bits and pieces like notices for for their board and their their surgery advising patients about the booklets . ###Okay . 
248766:30	###If you 're a discounting person then you 're not going to be very popular with the guy ###That 's right . 
248783:8	###Mhm mm . ###Now I 'm gonna point this out . 
248785:12	###I must point this out and this would be pointed out whichever company you go into . ###All assignments up to a hundred miles away from home you will be paid thirty percent . 
248785:48	###I must point this out and this would be pointed out whichever company you go into . ###All assignments up to a hundred miles away from home you will be paid thirty percent . 
248812:16	###But you 'll notice that the booklets are not dominated by advertising . ###No that 's right I was just roughly trying to work out 
248901:64	###And the training course will show you what to do there and you take samples away and the training manual as well . ###Right okay . 
248919:21	###However we do need a full er BUPA hospital order . ###Okay . 
248951:9	###Right . ###The only erm exception and that 's not even in your price structure , is that if somebody says , Look is there any chance I can have colour , that 's the only place they can have it on the back copy back cover sorry . 
248958:9	###That 's right okay . ###Okay ? 
248988:43	###Erm so there to that end ###Whichever right . 
249017:23	###Yes certainly . ###beginning . 
249033:9	###Because you think that because you ###Oh I mean I I after we after er we may never see look at each other again so my my job is to is to say right I can forward your name to and say look you know er I will make one or two points this guy er needs to be concentrated on , not as an exception , but you know because we 've taken fliers with people before you 've been very successful . 
249084:9	###Erm but er unless I I may repeat one or two of the things I 'd have said on the phone I 'm bound to do that , er the three things that are gonna be decided here today really is you if you and I erm you 've got inside information of course , er if you and I agree that er is the is the platform for you to earn some good money . ###Er secondly which environment er you feel comfortable with . 
249090:65	###It 's not quite that way . ###Er where did as a matter of interest where did John I did I interview John or did I 
249139:23	###Well that 's it . ###Get friendly with the client . 
249141:9	###Now you have okay so you have to give erm er you 're in an employed status at the moment ###Mhm yeah . 
249150:28	###Okay well you 'll probably know erm that of course we can start people immediately if they were ###Mhm . 
249227:10	###Right no qualifying in in in er I will tell you what the erm er sort of policy on that or opinion on that is that if you have got er a closure on the phone . ###Mhm . 
249314:7	###Yes they 're not really meant to be sent out ###Yeah . 
249416:12	###Yeah . ###Which we know you ca n't . 
249475:23	###Right so so no mail in connection with the assignment is sent to your home it 's always sent to the er . ###And when you arrive at the er estate agent there there is an envelope with all different sort of information in t in there . 
249571:109	###But if you do the whole thing and I 'm ###Yeah . 
249584:15	###I do n't think you can be that lucky ###Mm . 
249594:29	###Right . ###It really warms it up . 
249596:28	###Now one of the things that it must be very tempting to do is say , Yippee I 've got my list and go dashing in and phone everybody in sight ###Mhm . 
249661:20	###So some them could be pre-educated anyway . ###Oh right . 
249664:7	###Yes . ###There 
249738:10	###Mhm . ###Each er assignment has a unique number . 
249742:49	###Mhm . ###is ticked down there and I 'm not aware of what companies have special arrangements on estates . 
249742:76	###Mhm . ###is ticked down there and I 'm not aware of what companies have special arrangements on estates . 
249744:15	###But I was on medical and BUPA hospitals had special arrangements where they did n't have to have a cheque and where did n't have to have a banker 's order . ###Right . 
249750:10	###Bonuses are paid at proof stage . ###Every two months a list of ass er the numbers er of assignments that have been proofed comes round to the sales execs and that 's when they can claim their bonuses . 
249757:7	###However a lot of people do leave them there . ###It 's it 's you do n't forfeit them , it 's safe , but they accumula er they they have a cumulative effect and you pay tax or what 
249780:34	###Within the first of contact . ###all those to go for . 
249811:9	###I 'm halfway there . ###You 're there . 
249811:24	###I 'm halfway there . ###You 're there . 
249823:11	###That 's all right . ###See how delicate I 'm going to be . 
249864:14	###this piece of paper . ###It 's a bit big for where it should be . 
249874:52	###I would like you if you can read all there is there John er John 's had the same documentation but it might be slightly different . ###And that is okay er da de da de da got to be changed but we it 's because you 're going on wallets . 
249884:14	###Thursday Friday Now just check put the new piece of paper yes Publications Okay I 'm just er bringing this up to date so Monday Tuesday Wednesday evenings in fact you need er sorry Sunday Monday and Tuesday okay . ###I think that 's more or less it . 
249909:20	###with somebody ###Mhm . 
249912:39	###Right okay . ###All right ? 
249949:77	###the time I 'm not seeing him . ###Yeah sure . 
249959:49	###They 're all ###It 's not fair . 
249962:17	###I would 've walked out I think . ###Okay . 
250157:32	###Erm er we close on the phone . ###Right I see . 
250192:8	###In fact er double glazing and kitchen people try to close on that first meeting but they ###Yes . 
250203:7	###Yeah . ###our impression is and that 's this is er people like yourself sitting there , is that er you will have qual you know you wo n't go and see people er unless 
250204:10	###our impression is and that 's this is er people like yourself sitting there , is that er you will have qual you know you wo n't go and see people er unless ###I have to qualify erm you see . 
250206:10	###Er you have to keep your costs down ###Right yes . 
250221:9	###To do ###Oh I I could n't agree more . 
250229:36	###It still we still find it erm Trevor that er individuals , particularly from financial services ###Yes . 
250268:58	###Right . ###You about the company erm whether it was Joe Bloggs or Rod sitting here who represents the company , and and yourself . 
250306:7	###Yeah yeah . . ###So you ca n't see me is that it ? 
250306:14	###Yeah yeah . . ###So you ca n't see me is that it ? 
250331:40	###So in other words you do n't go out that door without a decision . ###No . 
250332:48	###No . ###Now that 's a bit of a change for a recruiter to have to do that . 
250334:53	###Yes I 've had one or two upset people go out of the door I must admit . ###They have n't nobody 's hit me yet . 
250383:9	###Company pension schemes ? ###Yes company pension schemes and all that . 
250450:101	###Yes I do yeah . ###Good . 
250461:12	###I 'm used to talking to peo you know talking to people and drawing people out . ###Because that 's the answer it is . 
250463:27	###Well we certainly have to draw them out when when ###Especially over the phone . 
250479:20	###Yes I think that 's what they say . ###Erm if ever I say if ever get a fifty year old in front of me I say , Hey let 's prove them wrong . 
250620:45	###So the advertisers come in for two years . ###Right . 
250748:38	###Yeah . ###you get to a training to the training school . 
250787:34	###When our marketing er executive goes round to the surgery one of the one of the things erm he he or she will determine with the with the practice is the number of booklets we 're going to print . ###Right . 
250914:15	###To ###No it 's no no . 
250935:64	###And we really have kept this down a barest minimum . ###Yeah . 
250939:45	###No . ###Does n't worry me cos it 
250941:9	###No if it 's the one thing I know that I do n't have to concern myself with as far as financial services is ###concerned is the small amount of paperwork all right . 
250945:7	###All right . ###What I why I was emphasizing earlier on how important it is to get all this over on the telephone . 
250969:103	###Yes yes that 's right . ###on the training course or guide you through it on the training course . 
251007:8	###Er first of all you will tell them that we want a contract . ###Yeah . 
251022:7	###Right . ###Okay ? 
251024:88	###You must tell them that the balance of the first year 's payment will be taken out through a banker 's order . ###Right . 
251033:15	###And the other thing is that the second year 's payment is taken out a year 's later through the same banker 's order . ###In fact that 's a sales pitch . 
251047:52	###That 's right . ###certainly . 
251047:74	###That 's right . ###certainly . 
251049:12	###We need a signature one signature on unless of course the company says that two people have got to sign it but you have to find that out . ###Yes . 
251049:38	###We need a signature one signature on unless of course the company says that two people have got to sign it but you have to find that out . ###Yes . 
251068:18	###That 's one and then the cheque is one of them . ###Right . 
251075:22	###Yellow Pages or some of the local journals or whatever and will have a copy in existence which we can use . ###Right . 
251126:23	###No no . ###I waited until the end of the week and said well erm you know . 
251145:10	###Right . ###But there 's a list in the training manual which you take away . 
251190:10	###that you are entitled to claim bonus on , if you are entitled , will be sent to the sales execs . ###Right . 
251194:36	###that 's one of mine from your personal records and you can claim your bonus . ###Right . 
251260:16	###ninety nine out of a hundred people go out there and they they 've we 've fixed a date to start and then ###Yeah . 
251288:21	###Yes . ###under that ? 
251289:7	###under that ? ###Yeah but surely sorry I I have to why do you question that now ? 
251290:7	###Yeah but surely sorry I I have to why do you question that now ? ###That has to have been explained to you on the phone . 
251351:69	###You see with the financial services act er financial services they can offer you a job right ###Mhm . 
251490:21	###We 're er I was asked a question earlier on today erm how many assignments will I be looking after in any one time and I just said one . ###And he only , you start one finished it and then go onto another one . 
251581:98	###selling so they wanna know exactly what they 're letting themselves in for . ###So well no yeah , is it worth seeing this guy ? 
251584:20	###Er so I get that out of the way er fairly early on . ###But what we 're trying to do today here Richard is three er er three things . 
251616:10	###Erm having er decided that , let me ask you if you of what you 've seen so far , and I have n't gone into er whichever product er do you thing this is do you think you could erm get into the habit of selling advertising and earning fairly substantial commission . ###Because in our field we 're we 're by far the biggest and the best in in terms of support and finance . 
251663:36	###Right . ###So you go into the guy you sell it to him and then you 've lost you 've got for two years you can do nothing with that person . 
251675:87	###But for the sales ###bloody waste of time this was I did n't get any business out of it or er I did well out of this 
251675:111	###But for the sales ###bloody waste of time this was I did n't get any business out of it or er I did well out of this 
251786:7	###You only go in one you see . ###But the other one I would 've er suggested would 've been the schools . 
251814:36	###Mm . ###Erm I 
251819:27	###Six thou a mailer to six thousand schools in addition to the ones we 've already got signed up . ###That would not be a problem . 
251822:10	###And all we say is that we pay extra commission if we send you away but it is against er against our principle and even er economics to send people that far away . ###Right okay . 
251857:7	###Okay . ###Let 's get some samples er in front of you all right ? 
251893:29	###Absolutely right . ###Okay so this list will be waiting for you when you arrive at the the assignment . 
251910:20	###And also have got an example here of what the earnings are . ###Every assignment on schools has a basic target of five thousand pounds all right ? 
251925:25	###Now some of the schools have asked for this spa , this by the way is belongs to the school . ###Some schools have asked for that to be kept for the sch er you know for them as well . 
251982:21	###I wanted to make sure that you see if if er at some stage , and people ask me this , if if we needed to transfer people ###Oh I see . 
251996:7	###The system tells us they 'll use you 'll frighten them off . ###And this is these are the sorts of things . 
252005:9	###Banker 's order they 'll use if if you have n't told them that we want a banker 's order signed . ###If there are two signatories on the cheque you 've gotta have two signatories on the er banker 's order . 
252021:24	###The third thing we want to complete the deal is copy . ###Now most people that come to see us have never been involved in designing or writing ads . 
252027:27	###If they want us to juggle it around we will do it . ###If they want us to design a brand new one we will do it at no extra cost . 
252044:9	###I mentioned bonuses being paid at proof stage . ###Every two months a list comes out to the sales consultants to say these assignments have been proofed . 
252075:15	###It 's available to you . ###Is that for you ? 
252257:11	###Yeah . ###Totally new this industry so 
252259:30	###Erm I have to say that most of the people that come to us have never been involved in advertising . ###Yeah . 
252261:15	###One of the things I am obviously gonna have to look at is the what you 've done in the last two or three years because traditionally erm we would n't ask van drivers to come along and see us . ###Yeah well there 's there 's 
252283:33	###Yeah yeah . ###Oh you can income support but it 's not why should I be any different . 
252312:48	###If may be one does n't respond at least we 've got a good er ###Yeah . 
252369:49	###There 's no way we 're going to send people out er to sell advertising er particularly as the majority of people have never done that before . ###Yep . 
252418:16	###Into sales . ###Into sales from being what I would call an artisan and er I do n't know what you would call yourself , but somebody who does things erm er on a er manual stroke artisan type work , over to sales . 
252601:18	###That 's right hard sell . ###using your own petrol . 
252620:29	###And listening to the people who 've been doing it for years . ###Okay well you you erm you cut your teeth on home security systems . 
252658:10	###You can make a lot of money . ###A lot of money . 
252664:11	###This is the only nine to five sales job I 've ever been able to offer anybody . ###Yeah . 
252709:7	###So you go in a tell them that six windows are gonna cost them four and a half thousand and they go ###Well it it also allows me to once again break in here because er one of the things that you ca n't do in home improvement areas is talk to people about the final price on the phone . 
252714:44	###No . ###Erm here we do . 
252716:12	###Once again it brings me in to the point where er double glazers have to go and measure up then do their , I know they 've got lovely lap tops I 've seen them now with their lap top comp their little samples there special catches here . ###I 've bought double glazing you see . 
252717:9	###I 've bought double glazing you see . ###I have n't had to in my this current house because they 're sealed units and I I bought the house new so . 
252772:10	###Right okay . ###Yeah okay . 
252785:75	###Er they just totally deviated from what we were doing . ###Right okay . 
252790:17	###That 's that 's away from network marketing that . ###And the network just went and it just collapsed . 
252915:34	###er and only because of what I different pitch it is on the phone . ###A lot of people ca n't get used to that . 
252943:31	###You know it does pour in if you have nought the week before anything you get is pouring in . ###But it was a very good week after that . 
252971:33	###School teacher yeah anybody ? ###Next door neighbour . 
252989:7	###He put a solicitor down , and last time I spoke with him I was defending him on a for fraud . ###We had he 's already started an assignment . 
253009:13	###where do you think you 'd put yourself ? ###You 've got schools golf clubs uni erm schools universities colleges er estate agents two products and medical areas two products . 
253155:12	###I 've gotta be able to tell him that . ###Yeah . 
253175:28	###The the lists that we get range from mediocre to pretty good to excellent . ###Yeah . 
253175:54	###The the lists that we get range from mediocre to pretty good to excellent . ###Yeah . 
253186:11	###Because if you phone these guys up and say , What a waste of time . ###Not get anything from them . 
253236:73	###Because that 's the quickest way they can get stuff to you . ###Yeah . 
253407:21	###Okay . ###I mean it it 'll go in certain into that 's a selling pitch too . 
253479:99	###So that you know see that they 're all different colours . ###Yeah . 
253549:59	###There are one or two exceptions on medical side that er we we call on the approved list ###Yeah . 
253579:9	###I mentioned earlier on that you you get paid erm bonuses at proof stage . ###That 's where you claim . 
253590:28	###It 's a good idea actually . ###Yeah it 's 
253604:47	###Yeah . ###Right now I 've we 've got some new documentation for the wallets . 
253628:13	###If they 're they 're in that top echelon . ###Yep . 
253679:11	###Okay . ###We will pay the travel costs to and then out on your assign er sorry out on your two days out . 
253698:33	###Right okay . ###Super . 
253796:247	###I think can I just say one thing we did actually h it was n't community industry erm the people that did it I do n't know ###They they trained that 's the 
253926:79	###So I took them at their word and phoned them up . ###Well the man nearly went through the roof and er , this was a Saturday morning , of course he did n't come , and in the meantime I had another replai re complaint about the path outside the W I hall , again which was a disgrace , not one person but several people . 
253926:103	###So I took them at their word and phoned them up . ###Well the man nearly went through the roof and er , this was a Saturday morning , of course he did n't come , and in the meantime I had another replai re complaint about the path outside the W I hall , again which was a disgrace , not one person but several people . 
253939:37	###mm . ###Thank you , we can follow up that up anyway , erm 
253964:16	###Could I ask through you chair er how this system is going to be policed ? ###That is the problem erm in so far as initially er we felt that it that that the onus would be on the individual , I E if it 's a short term stay car park they would not use it . 
253968:188	###Erm so it 's a question of how one can best do it , but initially it would be er the onus would go on the individual to use the the spaces not designated as short stay . ###I think the regrettable thing about the parking in in the town is the way that some of the disabled slots at the surgery are taken by the cars of people who are perfectly able to walk from the car park , and I think the great problem we 're going to have is we 're going to rely on the public spiritedness of our fellow townspeople and there does seem to be a fair group of people who are extremely selfish when it comes to come to parking . 
254181:9	###Brinkley is where it is . ###Is it Brinkley ? 
254283:113	###Mm . ###I think they 're erm 
254307:71	###and ha and Southwell parish is a very big parish and I think I 'm right is saying there are sixty seven footpaths in Southwell sorry ###More than that . 
254334:67	###Because I mean they 're being e I 've lived here twenty three years , this comes up every three or four years this dog business . ###I mean I 've written countless letters and nothing 's been done . 
254421:62	###er and and and nice to know that we want to establish contact and you may be aware that we 've had this plan , and , and what we want it to achieve is so and so , and we 'd like to set it up in this way . ###We could do that , I think perhaps , at the moment it 's ongoing , I think perhaps we ought to wait until , see what Julian and Jonathan come up with in February in perhaps . 
254457:93	###then we stand the possibility of being able to influence our own purchasing issues in order to er er to to make it happen . ###You see , we ca n't really know , that erm , we ca n't really know what is the most cost effective solution , can we ? 
254459:70	###We can only go by what they , overall costing effective solution , we can only go by what they tell us , I mean we we just have to believe what they tell us , do n't we ? ###We 
254505:14	###Right . ###We 've talked to them at length 
254625:12	###Okay , if that 's what you want to recommend , recommend it . ###I 
254682:54	###If , if that , if that happens , but clearly ###Yeah the firework systems supposed to be the centre of the Red Vase designs , we 're putting ourselves in a considerable disadvantage in not visiting and influencing these Red Vase Designs . 
254697:13	###Because I ai n't got no belief . ###Right . 
254748:15	###Now we have the number and today is the twelfth so we 've got to think of number twelve . ###Christopher . 
254765:11	###The fifth . ###All right so which two words are we going to start with ? 
254932:36	###Did we not finish that one ? ###No 
254946:7	###All right okay . ###Now then will you go back to your own proper seats now and I 'm going to give you a number . 
254955:84	###I want to count how many there are today here today . ###Count with me . 
255177:38	###Because of the erm because of the erm of the total times involved , inevitably the stage two 's are going to be , it 's it 's going to be in the second year that you 're going to see reasonable output from them , not in first year . ###What 's the reality of , supposing we took two on , and supposing the number of complaints steadied , or even fell , and the target times came way down , we 're meeting everything . 
255373:7	###So it 's a lot of risks and ifs in that is n't there ? ###But they would , we had Olar who was very good and who very rapidly was was earning his keep , and he did n't even stay here , so , you know , if you make the right appointment , it 's always dodgy that , you know . 
255433:34	###it is n't an indication that they 're going to be applying for any other jobs that come up . ###That 's true . 
255479:199	###That 's right . ###The the question mark I 've got is tha is that I I certainly accept that , it 's the it 's the question of the work being done at the appropriate level and the erm , the the fact that two sub teams are working without a complaint examiner , and , but I 
255483:30	###throughout the organization . ###Mm , yes . 
255633:10	###Presumably we would only be in a position to be considering an investigator if both , we had a erm a greater number of complaints from around the Commission coming into York , and i and further members of staff were to leave . ###Yes , well I 
255709:11	###Mm . ###From the first of September are you talking about ? 
255903:10	###Yes . ###Yes . 
255929:43	###No . ###but I mean if it 's not yet that 's fine . 
256037:63	###They 're nearly always open before I get there that er ###Can you do something about the ? 
256163:81	###And no one , sort of knows . ###No one is aware of what 's going on , does n't have a chance to meet them . 
256297:25	###Outside the meeting can I just say I 'm getting some of the new screening sheets through , you know first , but people do n't seem to know what they 're supposed to do with them and their in exactly the same position that they were before . ###All right sit please . 
256450:7	###We 're here because we 're suited to being here . ###If we sh wanted other conditions we 'd live on a different planet or we would have developed on a different plant . 
256753:42	###The planet turns round once every twenty four hours . ###And when you talk about earth as a planet it has a what at the beginning of the name because it 's a proper noun . 
256852:63	###I have n't got time to draw the world out properly . ###That for you information is sea . 
256864:16	###The sun rays are shooting off into space you know that light travels in straight lines , yes ? ###Take my words for it . 
256968:13	###Wo n't particularly matter with what we 're doing now but it will do when we go on to seasons . ###Very important that the pole is pointing top and bottom . 
256969:12	###Very important that the pole is pointing top and bottom . ###You do n't have to do it perfectly round because the earth is n't perfectly round . 
256970:15	###You do n't have to do it perfectly round because the earth is n't perfectly round . ###You do n't have to draw the continent and oceans exactly as they are because it 's a diagram . 
257012:10	###Erm Luke put your hand up and wait to be asked to speak please . ###Yes Luke ? 
257027:24	###It was very nice was n't it ? ###So good girl . 
257042:103	###It was after Jesus was born so we call that B C , no sorry it was n't after it was before Jesus was born we call it B C before Christ . ###It was about two thousand years ago and it was how many years before Christ . 
257144:8	###Erm right so it was it was supposed to be a disgrace to lose your standard in your legion in the Roman army . ###So there was way they were going to let the standard bearer go on his own and face all these fierce fighters . 
257160:37	###Mrs has already asked for her class to be after one and we 've only got the two classes to do . ###Erm right erm Jennifer . 
257177:7	###Have all the other classes been looked at ? ###Yes . 
257358:38	###Therefore the analysis that we 've done , which is an economic analysis , actually supports the level of er calculation the County Council have produced for land requirements for the city . ###Unfortunately as we saw earlier with the housing discussions , we are very much a pint pot as the analogy was used and that a quart just ca n't be fitted into it . 
257393:10	###The reason why we 're having to go to a higher figure now is there are two major areas of land , er one is the land behind the railway station , the British Rail land , and the other is the land at a a location called St Nicholas Field , a former household waste site , both of which we are taking steps to bring forward for development . ###Therefore we believe that during the plan period , those sites are likely to come forward and make a improved contribution to meeting our share of the Greater York employment needs . 
257397:119	###You may find that just a subtle difference but I think that in terms of the way erm make allocation in our local plan , that it does cause some confusion . ###Yes . 
257425:12	###No Chairman I do n't think we do . ###Erm we 're quite happy with with what Mr Curtis says about that , er we acknowledge that er while the need will be er probably much greater than the it 's a physical fact of life in York that there is n't a great deal of er available land . 
257425:98	###No Chairman I do n't think we do . ###Erm we 're quite happy with with what Mr Curtis says about that , er we acknowledge that er while the need will be er probably much greater than the it 's a physical fact of life in York that there is n't a great deal of er available land . 
257475:48	###housing to industry . ###David Curtis , York City Council . 
257494:115	###You 're very clear in what you 're saying ###Good point that yeah . 
257567:63	###Thank you . ###I 'm to quote then . 
257591:71	###We both argued that the levels of er housing development in Craven , Harrogate and to a lesser extent perhaps Amblet Hambleton should not be constrained , so as to reduce erm the the steady trickle if I can describe it as that of migration from the West Yorkshire conurbation to those areas , in perhaps er l looking at the different proposal for the new settlement which might be located in the Leeds York corridor . ###We 've argued that that would stimulate migration as opposed simply to accommodate past trends , so we 've argued that , but the the problem for West Yorkshire well for Leeds in particular is that the brown field sites we have , the regeneration that we need is not of sites which would readily accommodate housing , they 're not sites which lend themselves as nice places to live . 
257687:7	###Well if they 're within existing industrial areas , then they 're not included in the I five provision are they ? ###They they are vacant sites , serviced and ready for development . 
257768:19	###In a nutshell the approved structure plan seriously underestimated the employment needs of the district , and it allocated only forty six hectare for a fifteen year period . ###What this means in essence when when you look at the geography of of the district is that it imposes severe restrictions on where you can distribute reasonable sized employment allocations around the district . 
257991:18	###Then it is not targeted towards any sector of the workforce . ###Is it ? 
258079:232	###Erm the reasons that we were er anxious about this allocation to Harrogate erm stemmed from the point that I think somebody should make on this occasion and that is that it does seem there are two local authorities within North Yorkshire that have particularly distinguished er issues to deal with on employment . ###One is Selby which we 've just spent the morning discussing and for very very different reasons the other is Harrogate . 
258123:10	###In terms of size or ###I think it depends very much on the circumstances . 
258151:54	###Mhm . ###Erm that was based , the thirty four workers per hectare was based on a a survey of er employment site ac sites across the county . 
258213:64	###Erm I 've I particularly important because the districts here will need to feel very clear about what it is County Hall would not sorry would or would or would not jump on their necks for you see . ###This is terribly important . 
258246:20	###Does Mr Potter accept it and he has no option use classes order ? ###Er David Potter , North Yorkshire County Council . 
258263:10	###Yes is that , that is my impression of the situation , the erm the basis of provision in the Greater York area is is that there is a site that is available and committed for er employment use . ###Erm if that site does n't come forward , we wo n't be looking to transfer that allocation to the rest of the district . 
258266:148	###Thank you that clarifies the issue and concentrates our minds on this figure of sixty hectares . ###Now we in the Harrogate Civic Society would like to see the rest of the district allocation reduced at least to fifty hectares which has something to do with the forecast requirement on the grounds of past take-up , and I believe it is nearer the original figure for the rest of the district floated by the county in the initial consultations before amendment was made to the allocation between Greater York and the rest of the district . 
258277:21	###Now the point has already been raised and partly answered in the question in the case of Selby District Council as to whether it matters whether there is an over-provision of land for industry and other employment . ###Well one detrimental consequence of allocating more land for industry and employment is the a greater unpredictability of take-up . 
258277:44	###Now the point has already been raised and partly answered in the question in the case of Selby District Council as to whether it matters whether there is an over-provision of land for industry and other employment . ###Well one detrimental consequence of allocating more land for industry and employment is the a greater unpredictability of take-up .

258281:156	###It may be the ones that are environmentally sensitive will be taken up and other sites which are less environmentally sensitive will not be taken up , and er so we are anxious that we do not over- provide because we are anxious to save many attractive sites around Harrogate from development . ###And er I 've already referred to a byproduct of over-provision that sites are then moved on to sh car showrooms and erm supermarkets which are needs which or demands which would probably not have justified the allocation of the land for industry in the first place but once the land is allocated to industry it seems to be thought that no harm would be done by allocating those to something else . 
258321:50	###Erm the resident population will of course er include a significant proportion of people who are migrating into the district er as we saw last week . ###Erm the calculations that we have at the moment take on board the twenty five percent back in migration as proposed in the housing figures . 
258352:129	###Can I conclude on Harrogate then and we adjourn for tea until three thirty . ###Thank you . 
258353:37	###Thank you . ###Erm because he would like to make a comment on the exceptions policy , he has n't been invited to participate tomorrow , er I have exercised some latitude and said yes I will be happy to hear what he has to say , erm there is a prescribed time limit of which he is aware . 
258440:50	###Erm the District Council is n't being arbitrary in er in this respect . ###We er we 've tried to er to meet the the the County Council 's requirements , we 've scaled down our original er provision of erm employment land to take account of the emerging structure plan thinking . 
258464:8	###rely on that particularly . ###With regard to the Greater York bias , the Greater York bias he refers to is simply a bias towards where the opportunities for development exist in Greater York , it is not a bias in any other sense than in terms of its distribution . 
258559:14	###Er in environmental terms ###erm we 're already to release green field site which has been fairly environmentally sensitive 
258687:29	###Now you ca n't have it both ways , surely ? ###Dave Girt , Leeds City Council . 
258741:12	###The figure which has been put forward by the county of a hundred and twenty two hectares for Selby deals with three elements . ###It deals with local need , it deals with planned migration and it deals with unemployment . 
258741:140	###The figure which has been put forward by the county of a hundred and twenty two hectares for Selby deals with three elements . ###It deals with local need , it deals with planned migration and it deals with unemployment . 
258771:35	###The second thought is in relation to the second criteria , in view of the move of government policy in particular P P G 4 would it be helpful sensible to include the word under-used in terms would increase the use of vacant under- used or derelict premises and sites ? ###And my final point is in effect a question . 
258811:7	###David Allenby , Harrogate Borough Council . ###I just wanted I was trying to rack my brain to see when er we 've had real regard to this policy 
258908:105	###Erm in in the context of Greater York , should you wish to to base your recommendations on er such a change , erm I do n't believe that would cause the County Council any problems , and you heard from round the table that I think the the districts are quite happy on on that score as well . ###On the issue of Selby which er took quite a lot of time er I think it was an important area er bearing in mind the different views that have been expressed . 
258997:64	###you see this this this one you brought in here ###Mhm . 
258999:9	###unless the local printer 's very cleaver somehow and got that advertising to to sponsor er the booklet they 've had to charge for it . ###Mhm . 
259049:56	###Erm ###Yeah . 
259054:7	###Schools universities and colleges they were a spin-off from the parents ' choice charter . ###Right . 
259208:29	###Okay . ###Erm and I 'm you know I 'm sure now it 's it 's 
259216:10	###Yes yeah . ###what sort of that we have . 
259235:7	###I think network marketing I think it I think that turns out to be jolly hard work because if you 're not recruiting it 's the recruitment part of it . ###Oh yeah . 
259239:60	###Yes I mean my wife and I have had a go at that . ###Have you ? 
259407:25	###When you have a sales meeting there 's the whole all the sales people who smoke , because it 's a totally no smoking company . ###Yes yeah . 
259409:13	###They have they by law they have to . ###I do n't smoke I like that . 
259491:56	###You can start the next day . ###If you decide you want a couple of days off to take your grandson shopping 
259493:13	###or something like that , er or your husband even with his cheque book , then you just have to tell us . ###Mm mhm . 
259504:25	###So all of this is all set up for you . ###Right okay . 
259541:7	###It 's softest form is n't it ? ###it 's soft . 
259632:87	###Go to a school you 've got fifty to sixty teachers . ###Mm mm . 
259645:14	###No not at all no . ###I missed lunch and everything . 
259699:56	###At er L 2 units of labour the slope of the ray from the origin right , is tangent to our total product curve . ###At L 2 the slope of a , the ray from the origin is actually tangent , I 'm sorry , the the ray is actually tangent and therefore the slope of that ray is the same as the slope of the total product curve at that point . 
259701:24	###As a result , marginal product which is the slope of the total product curve and average product must be the same at L 2 units of labour . ###Beyond L 2 units of labour the slope of the ray from the origin on the total product curve starts to fall . 
259707:188	###Okay , so that 's what you learn in micro economics this year and which should be fairly familiar to you ask now is why that is the case . ###Why do we get this , these relationships in particular , right , why does the marginal product curve intersect the average product curve at the average product curve 's maximum ? 
259963:15	###I 'm sure we 'll develop something ###I 'm sure we 'll develop something to go Okay . 
260030:97	###Er , a more sensible way of using it , providing divisional good ideas . ###Yes . 
260033:40	###Erm , are now in the process of following up to see if who has made er the switch to the new regime , and I have been approached by one project leader who has two programmers who refused to change , and has asked for help . ###Right . 
260059:103	###For a department within C U and er we 've done this design on it , and come up with a new system , that we want to try and sell to other departments within the company . ###Now there is one department in particular that already have a training system in place , albeit the old volume two , but having said that , it works quite well , really . 
260123:11	###The influence is really to get the system , and keep it running . ###Yes . 
260155:41	###Thanks for that group . ###Er , I think they sound like a good set of people you can work with , though . 
260374:103	###Ladies first . ###No . 
260388:85	###Good . ###seemingly changing . 
260389:134	###seemingly changing . ###Every if the reason that something 's gotta change is obvious to everybody , then you do n't really need to have any influence over their It usually has to be some considered opinion that you want 
260458:20	###Get them round the wrong way , of course , and you spend ten thousand pounds worth of preparation on a ten p problem . ###And a ten p and people say it 's money . 
260518:9	###Many of these models and this is one , where you can actually go in on the , on the opposite side . ###It says , positive outcomes . 
260527:54	###Yes . ###You 've really run here . 
260563:25	###and they go and do it . ###So , the external behaviour can either be er , well I do n't know to ask you to do this , but their not gonna like this , but , or you can try and tell 
260627:13	###Yeah . ###The trick is to lo to watch for them , to be aware of them , erm , because we 've we 've practically , better to go around the cycle , wherever you start , you can say , I chose to start here , but you can start anywhere , the minute you go in and give positive bits , which will create positive reactions , which will give you positive memory . 
260969:48	###Pleas pleasure doing business with you . ###The pleasure was ours , entirely . 
261021:38	###There 's something , there 's something ###Sorry . 
261039:72	###Ten horses available . ###Fifteen needed . 
261069:36	###What else ? ###That 's working well . 
261073:15	###And fifteen were needed . ###Right . 
261074:35	###Right . ###So we would have have to make sacrifices in some respects . 
261242:71	###Maybe that comes in with a hat that says , Authoritarian , disciplined type of interview . ###And if I did come and sit face to face across the desk , it would have a discipline . 
261244:8	###I think if you were gonna s use any other situation to this , with the quantity of information that you 'd have to , to record , as we 're going through , ###Mm . 
261292:27	###Thinking things out . ###But perhaps one other thing , I mean , it 's all useful . 
261308:7	###And of course , we settled at eight point six two or something ridiculous . ###I mean , we were exactly where we said we were gonna be , but suddenly I did n't realise that he was boss . 
261310:9	###He had to show other people , that he had gone because that was what boss 's did . ###Mm . 
261333:147	###How they actually need to play it . ###Erm , but we are n't going to the sort of , end of degree , that er , I say this , and then you sort of enter stage left and say this , and I respond like this , and then erm , something else happens , and then somebody comes crashing in through the door . 
261405:26	###And what 's he going to say to that . ###And what are you going to there . 
261433:127	###I guess there 's only six of us , who probably finish about mid-day tomorrow , erm , of which time there are various options . ###Erm , you can have a twelve o' clock bus , if you wanted to sort of flee your premises , with a packed lunch , or without a packed lunch , if you er , if you do n't want to do that . 
261558:103	###We are operating within a of because of the government this Council is erm nett cuts of all its services of four point two million reduction of four point er two million and the policy system . ###Er to look at the budget for ninety four to ninety five in ranges of seventy two million to seventy three point three . 
261581:122	###seriously do need to put erm into the passenger transport . ###Town centres er we think there should be growth of two hundred thousand , it 's not enough . 
261584:9	###In terms of planning growth erm right take orders item number four erm , this is really just a correction because attendance for fifty nine should actually be fifty . ###Erm and in terms of rights of way er growth orders we would like to see growth of two hundred about two hundred pounds . 
261620:184	###Conservative Party , I listen to you . ###The whole essence of Conservative Party that 's put before the Environment Committee today and I remind us that it was only in a very short few months ago that this Council might be at cuts of up to twenty million pounds in order that low in the very country . 
261638:74	###So traffic calming er is very very now er an agenda supports the general thrust of this County Council ###Road Safety had national accolades er and so that is a very important element for us . 
261706:38	###Does anyone wish to speak interest . ###Er Mr Hudson . 
261728:85	###Structural maintenance er yes erm yes down the bottom I was looking down erm and and we are proposing a significantly lower er cut on both the the officers and proposal there that the other er er that the other er er that the other parties . ###That goes to all of us er er er and our safety at various calming er measures . 
261729:7	###That goes to all of us er er er and our safety at various calming er measures . ###Er but calming is not the only issue er er calming is is important and we recognise that but it seems to me that with that you have to enhance reliable public transport . 
261730:28	###Er but calming is not the only issue er er calming is is important and we recognise that but it seems to me that with that you have to enhance reliable public transport . ###We have to see more people being encouraged to use the buses and not their own cars . 
261737:7	###The traffic calming measures , a lot of them take place in my constituency . ###Some success , some are an absolute waste of . 
261741:20	###what sort of things that have been done . ###In one there which does serve pupils taking er the largest school in the county , there were fourteen accidents the year before road cuts were introduced , in the year since they have been introduced there have been none . 
261788:25	###in the last two or three years and er it is in danger of overwhelming us . ###There is such strong 
261800:11	###Erm reference was made er , however , by Chris er and by Martin er ###Chairman can I raise a point again , erm second time . 
261809:211	###St Albans would end up fire station . ###Er and between the Liberal er Liberal Democrats Labour if you support our proposal we 'll support yours , will end up as a temporary fire station and . 
261816:7	###I think we all today . ###Here , here , here . 
261888:45	###They suggested ten . ###Now I think if you look back on this report famous report that did n't through . 
261910:58	###Er this will not cut in any budget erm as as can be seen from our sheet . ###I 'd like to erm two constant er budget , we feel that reinstatement of the capital design staff salaries is important if not because . 
261910:67	###Er this will not cut in any budget erm as as can be seen from our sheet . ###I 'd like to erm two constant er budget , we feel that reinstatement of the capital design staff salaries is important if not because . 
261912:61	###Design work cannot be turned on and off er it is er feel flowing continuous process and we must be particularly must be er as well as practical work in the future . ###I hardly dare mention traffic calming but it does seem to be the flavour of of the month at the moment but to see that the existing work doubled by and I know it 's going to cost the county erm this but if you do n't want to talk about the children and their crime it is er traffic calming it certainly is a and I do believe 
262009:34	###Nobody seriously wants this installation . ###This is an installation that this County is not required to have one waste from four Counties . 
262020:8	###Even in this country where advances be in minimal amounts of impurities that can go through simply not the population prepared to allow this to happen to us . ###Surely in this day and age the all we hear governments consultation documents , even your own consultation documents has been put out to the er future towning plans . 
262023:17	###This is what we are here for , it 's what your Council is here for . ###Your care and our representatives to look after the interests of the population within your area . 
262067:26	###Erm and er I I I I 'm planning to accept the Labour amendments and the Conservative addition to them . ###Er Er this motion is not an attempt to preempt applications Mr Chairman come before us that 's Mr said time is indicating for the first time that er September might possibly be months . 
262070:30	###Erm from the content of the post bags in the past three months members of this Committee are well aware of the anxieties of the people but the circle , building waste incinerator on the golden edge first of the City . ###The volume of the testing matters which have received my . 
262080:55	###Erm I turn to the last paragraph motion Mr Chairman . ###When an application is enforced Community is proposed then positive measures should be taken to advise residents of the proposals . 
262089:45	###Chairman erm I 'd start erm by for the Labour Group motion committee like people also who erm have actually sort of written to us letters repeat what they said but the vast vast majority that erm have expressed the genuine concerns of the people who have left work . ###Er a pity too and er also the villages erm in the in the area erm which I know very well and my and the Letchworth er Letchworth itself . 
262092:48	###Erm this week the three routes fully abrupt committee have in fact sent a letter in their joint names to the press in North Hertfordshire er trying to say erm what the position is at the moment . ###Er say that the application has not yet been considered . 
262093:53	###Er say that the application has not yet been considered . ###Erm that it it it will be erm that by law the County Council must consider any planning application which is made erm to it for a particular site . 
262094:10	###Erm that it it it will be erm that by law the County Council must consider any planning application which is made erm to it for a particular site . ###We do n't use sites , we do n't make planning applications , applicants do but we have to consider that we ca n't say we do n't like it , go elsewhere . 
262096:8	###We do have to consider it . ###We are also not allowed to take into account records of . 
262096:85	###We do have to consider it . ###We are also not allowed to take into account records of . 
262126:51	###As far as this Planning Application is concerned . ###The Planning Policy which applies purely to the and the in case the sub Committee have already er discussed with etc etc for this . 
262127:64	###The Planning Policy which applies purely to the and the in case the sub Committee have already er discussed with etc etc for this . ###As far as the other aspect is concerned , that there is no something that would have to be dealt with on its merits taking account of the arguments for and against . 
262130:28	###O K . ###Mr . 
262130:93	###O K . ###Mr . 
262195:17	###What is amazing is that two did n't seem to like that . ###And then look at the conflicting interest , whereby the Consultants did their own report and did n't research into it . 
262219:14	###On page five again this is the persistence , the forty per cent in favour , thirty per cent against . ###That again is not sixty per cent of those again I would suggest that that part of the report is misleading . 
262222:116	###did the Consultant have difficulty here I suggest but if one giver of strategy is demolished by public consultation then that 's fortunate but in the second demolish then your whole strategy tumbles down . ###This strategy does not have public support . 
262238:154	###So all in all er the survey approved says ###in in coming to grips with this issue we have realised how particular they are met er and a number of members will prevent from getting to that meeting to to put their views on the table and for this reason er they decided to defer that . 
262240:137	###Er the Director of Transportation recognises that , it was said that he 's happy to to await the outcome of liberations by that er District Council and that 's what the Conservative group has suggested that we do but if he wants you to recognise that every policy has to be accepted , the way in which they have performed time and decided to be addressed by my members of of all parties and therefore I urge you to support the Conservative resolutions I now put forward . ###Thank you for secondly I was that the decision now is left to the the District Council er have you not discuss some parts of elements er could be addressed in the short term . 
262245:10	###try and be er er er as positive as I always am but er ###all well know . 
262297:14	###That 's it , that is it . ###We 've waited at St Albans . 
262370:97	###Thanks ###Okay , thank you bye bye 
262375:110	###What the Children , what the Children Act does at least recognise in the Conservative Government passing the Children Act is the importance of Local Government . ###These are very important services and they are placed , just like care in the community will be , when it eventually is put into practice . 
262453:7	###I do not believe that magistrates will be able to show any greater compassion or understanding that our own elected members . ###In fact , with the involvement of solicitors , I think the whole business will be less personal , with much less informality and genuine understanding . 
262499:75	###I think it 's the worse example of pure political self-indulgence that I have ever come across in the eight ye nearly eight years on this Council ###I think , I regard it as an insult to the people who actually elected us to come to this Cou these Council meetings . 
262558:129	###We actually believe that the people of would prefer prefer their money spending on the environment and front end services . ###And we actually believe that it 's the individual 's power to choose . 
262620:29	###You 're not walking , not about widespread privatisation , but creeping privatisation and you 're now talking about not opting out of the National Health Service but you 're now talking about opting out of local national Health Service control . ###People know this , they identify with this , they recognise that you 're back-tracking and it looks as though your ke case is hereby weakened . 
262636:7	###That would worry me if I was a Labour Party member because you have got a good case but you are not putting it across in a way that convinces doctors themselves . ###You are actually , I know that many doctors traditionally vote Conservative , but you are actually behind the Tories with only twenty one percent support . 
262639:12	###There are lots of things to attack the Conservatives on and it is a question of how that is actually done . ###We do n't need to make things up . 
262640:9	###We do n't need to make things up . ###We do n't have to . 
262672:130	###Every time we 've had a Conservative administration waiting lists have gone down . ###It 's not as if the contribution of Labour Councillors to th to the management of Health Authorities has been very er productive . 
262674:35	###I 've sat on the district management board of Health Authority for four years and watched Labour Councillors coming sometimes , often not coming at all , sitting there saying nothing , debating very little in the way of useful contributions until , I have to say , Councillor came along and er a er , sorry to get you unpopular with the rest of your colleagues ###they seem to be there just to guard vested interests . 
262801:7	###Lord Mayor , the Conservative Group welcomes this opportunity to debate reforms in the National Health Service . ###The only disappointment is the lack of substance in Councillor motion . 
262823:129	###We actually believe that the people of would prefer prefer their money spending on the environment and front end services . ###And we actually believe that it 's the individual 's power to choose . 
262953:10	###Council housing , as we know it , is not the answer . ###The role of Local Authorities as large scale landlords does simply not work . 
263115:13	###No , it 's your policy that if you tell the lie often enough people people believe it . ###Councillor , well well we 'll find out , Councillor has put this motion in , I 've wound it up Lord Mayor , I 'll challenge him or any of his team to a public debate where we can look at the record about , name your place , name your time , I will , I will debate with you in public Councillor on our record of reforms and the Health Service . 
263168:86	###But the Euro Cities and the position of in Europe is of tremendous importance because of the failure of your Government to recognise the needs of this district and the nis needs of this region . ###We 've heard , so eloquently said by many of my comrades tonight , about the problems right across the sectors affecting and I congratulate each and every one on their contribution tonight . 
263178:45	###that robbed social services , education and housing . ###You know it 's true . 
263228:61	###We 've had that public debate and we 've got the support from the people of for what we 're doing within Europe . ###There 's a long way to go because many of these companies that we 've mentioned are gonna fight fierce competition from Europe and we need to assist them . 
263237:27	###And without a doubt our history , the commonwealth of nations and business acumen prove this . ###We can develop in Europe only within the guidelines set out by Central Government , a Government quite clear that a joining of the attitudes and minds is desirable , not federalism . 
263237:170	###And without a doubt our history , the commonwealth of nations and business acumen prove this . ###We can develop in Europe only within the guidelines set out by Central Government , a Government quite clear that a joining of the attitudes and minds is desirable , not federalism . 
263239:36	###The and their self-opinionated Premier , Jacques Delores , must be told clearly that we stand for co-operation of Western style democracy , not the old Eastern block style of all encompassing socialist state with the dead hand of Brussels directing policies , as Moscow did with the U S S R. Freedom of the independent nation and people must confer . ###My Lord Mayor , after setting the parameters , I do feel that can continue it 's good relations with our other cities and use Brussels as a tool to this end . 
263240:7	###My Lord Mayor , after setting the parameters , I do feel that can continue it 's good relations with our other cities and use Brussels as a tool to this end . ###Yes , Euro Cities is an organisation of Brussels but it must not be allowed to dominate the proceedings and massage and manage the cities . 
263242:7	###It must be free city to city co-operation within a loose association with Brussels . ###We have seen the stupidity of the E E C agriculture programme . 
263243:40	###We have seen the stupidity of the E E C agriculture programme . ###This must be avoided in Euro Cities . 
263245:13	###Euro Cities can be a sound tool for co-operation and our officers must be at the forefront with the Chambers of Trade of Commerce , and Development Association and all , all of which have expertise in Europe . ###Both agencies that the chief executive 's office refers to frequently . 
263250:38	###There are issues across Europe that we need to be aware of as a city . ###However , we need to conserve financial prudence and only send members occasionally , with officers more frequently . 
263268:8	###We support liaison but not self indulgence by Labour Councillors . ###Even that auguste paper , the T and A , in the editorial , recently stated , we cannot afford the extravagance of going along just to see the party , just to be at the party . 
263323:34	###But I think there 's something more important than funding that was realised at that Conference between Eastern and Western Local Authorities and that is that we need to be there to assist because we can assist . ###One of the last speeches that the Conference heard was a very emotional speech from a delegate from , Russia , within a winds breath of Chernobyl . 
263421:40	###It 's been cut again , as a result of your Government 's policies , so the technology and the support that we need to go into Europe to win in Europe to help industry is being strangled once again by your Government . ###So if we look at the positive effects of Europe . 
263422:12	###So if we look at the positive effects of Europe . ###If we look at regional Governments across Europe that do n't have to go cap in hand every time to some deadbeat in White Hall , right , they go straight to Europe and they network across Europe and they exchange ideas and things happen . 
263545:243	###I 'm , in my own mind , I 'm sure this is due to a proliferation of working parties , extra committee meetings a , a , and seminars , and I personally think it 's typical of when your party get anywhere near control that there is always more talking and less action , but I do believe that we , we , we 're , we are not looking good in the eyes of the public in this overspending of our own allowances . ###I think you 've got to do something drastic , at the end of last year a considerable number of working parties and committees were actually reduced or eliminated , and I look at education and I look at the sub- committees of education , they 've all been replaced by working parties now that meet more and more regularly . 
263550:149	###From the first of April ninety-three to the thirty-first of December ninety-three , that figure is a hundred and sixty-five , so therefore it , it , it 's doubled in effect . ###Now if you assume that they were paid somewhere between a half-day allowance and a full-day allowance , you 're probably looking at somewhere up towards fifteen hundred pounds . 
263593:40	###amendment which I hope will financial control which is that the of financial services shall have no discretion to accept claims for the financial year ninety-three ninety-four , submitted after the thirtieth of June nineteen-ninety- four , that effectively means that that two month rule which he does have discretion on he will not have in the case of late claims in this financial year , that means we 'll know exactly what the figures are , by the thirtieth of June . ###Can I put that , does anybody want to debate that ? 
263635:13	###Yeah , but , I mean I was just , erm , I found that very informative as well , I was very disappointed that if that much money er , information was available that we were not given it as members , because it would have made decision making far more sensible , but erm , ###I as an amendment as I am involved in the attendance allowance . 
263654:77	###And yet we are seeing as members , coming back to Mr ' s point , making a , setting an example which is opposite to that which we force on our employees . ###And the other one is financial . 
263669:78	###to be published along with the expense claims ? ###Yes , to be published along with the expense claims . 
263675:58	###Yes , I 'd p , I would personally prefer the word people or parents ###I 'm confident that the scheme wo n't cost anything like as much as the estimate , but I 'm , I 'm sure it 's right that it 's been , having having done some background work to see how many people might claim it I 'm confident that that we 've erred on the safe side here by a substantial amount , and that 's why I 'm sure it can be met from the overall budget . 
263714:84	###er , Mr . ###Thank you chairman . 
263728:203	###Do n't shake your head Mr , read the letters that are coming to me , from those schools like who can see the reduction in their budget next year . ###Look at the police budget , and we shall be discussing the police budget later on , you had a windfall , underspend on police pensions , but we all know those police will retire at some time or other , and when they do there is a commitment to their lump sum payments and their pensions . 
263748:74	###I think we also need to recognise that there has also been a er , high level of er , commitment from er , officers employed by this council to achieving the changes that we have asked in terms of financial management , now I 'm not going to pretend for a moment that er , we 've gone all the way there yet . ###But I think in the few months that this administration has er , has been in office , it is encouraging to see that the county council is operating inside the budget , er , which I believe was actually set by the previous administration , erm , er over which we had no influence whatsoever . 
263756:21	###It might not surprise you that it 's the highways budget that concerns me . ###Erm , I think it 's a false economy to cut on maintenance , you only leave trouble there , you 're putting off the problem for our successors . 
263761:37	###Well I will just come in here because I think Mr wants to get his figures a bit more accurate . ###I do n't think even in our wildest dreams we managed to spend an extra five million in the first few weeks of this council , I remember a couple of million going into schools and few hundred thousand for voluntary organizations , and er , and old people 's homes . 
263899:103	###But he does n't acknowledge , and what , this is what I find concerning , the fact that we have in some areas of the county , amalgamated schools into a new school , West Grinstead and Alderbury for example , and taken surplus places out . ###In the Meer area we , we , we 've built Meer First School into an annexe and we took surplus places out , so we have done something , and he does n't seem to even acknowledge that , which I find concerning . 
263916:44	###I 've looked , for example , erm , to his comment on the police communications rooms , which will actually have a significant impact on er , the budget of the police committee in future years . ###Yes , I , I mean , I think , I do n't want to come in there , but I think the difference between the point that you 've made Mr and , and some of the others is the district auditor has n't put a thing in a box . 
263928:45	###Some members voted against . ###But erm , I , certainly Mr had the right through standing orders to ensure that that er , was er , taken to county council , would n't he ? 
263938:25	###Can I echo the comments that people have made on the value of rural schools to villages . ###It 's something I think everyone recognizes at their own , that village school plays more than just the function of educating children , in small village communities . 
263940:36	###But there is the other argument that has to be taken off , is that of , there is money , and I , we all would like to say that we 'd like to pour as much money into education as we feel we could spend . ###But it does n't mean , it 's not , reality says that 's not possible , because central government will not give us additional money to spend on education . 
263943:9	###And why should the education of those who live in large towns suffer to finance uneconomical schools in rural areas of this county . ###I 'm not saying that they are uneconomical , but there may be the odd one or two cases , like the of Berwick St James is a fine example , when it became uneconomical to maintain that school for the number of pupils which were attending , or proposed to be taken in the near future , and it was a sensible option for those children , and economically to close that school . 
263950:7	###We are not prepared to stand by and let schools in areas that we represent get closed or re-organised or whatever , at the expense of small village schools , which should be re-organised , or re-rationalised before schools in large urban areas . ###We will not take the brunt of the district auditor 's reduction in surplus places . 
263995:51	###Okay . ###Because if you still want the answer to progress , the answer will come back none . 
264044:15	###Timber trade world-wide is doing an enormous amount of work already to make sure that sustainable timber is supplied , and the horror stories are slowly going away , and a lot of people now do not buy timber in this country , from those countries who 've got a bad track record , but are buying from countries like Denmark and Sweden , where it 's a national law on their forestry policy . ###I , I , I believe that a lot of work 's going on . 
264104:54	###And I 'd want to know that the person who did that was going to be punished , and punished properly . ###And I think for too long , we 've listened to the libertarians who want to think of the rights of the criminal all the time , and er , and do n't worry too much about the victim . 
264123:61	###I think in fact it 's a bit of a cheek for the Chief Constable to go to the Home Secretary here ev , Home Secretary again this year , asking for more officers , when he has n't recruited all the ones that he was given last year . ###And that 's perhaps why he 's been turned down . 
264139:115	###Erm , he , he , he er , decried the building of the hangar , in fact that resulted in an infinitely cheaper and better contract , saved a lot of money doing it . ###Er , I can assure him the Chief Constable more than shares our concerns about his , hi , hi , his under-funding . 
264285:109	###You look at the others , then so who do you particularly want in your team . ###If you ever get to this wonderful stage of being able to pick your own team , it would be marvellous would n't it ? 
264288:64	###That they would fit in as well . ###Well that 's , that 's the one test , the Belvin test . 
264309:9	###It very much depends on the people work with . ###But on the other hand say you 're a hundred and you 're working more with adapters they 're going to really think you 're a strong innovator . 
264329:7	###Well let 's look at the problem in a different way then . ###Let 's turn it on it 's head . 
264338:99	###Especially if you get them at the , the far end of the continuum . ###But you also need them in your team , because if you 're trying to solve a problem that is difficult , or what 's called a messy problem , we 'll come back to nice messy problems in a minute , you need somebody to come up with some good ideas , some ways of solving it . 
264367:9	###The usual way that you might attempt to get up a er , tree . ###Where as innovators say that 's boring , er there 's got to be better ways of doing it you see . 
264417:20	###What the papers say . ###We 'll put media , I ca n't get it all in . 
264583:96	###I believe it 's more hard to get ###That really is er , a separate thing is n't it , the er , the crime ? you , you , you see the sort of things that we 're doing . 
264604:23	###And then , and that , that may solve all sorts of problems for you , if you were going to do that sort of seven days a week , let 's say from seven in the morning until , I do n't know , nine at nigh , at night or something . ###That might solve a lot of problems . 
264639:40	###Because the more ideas you get , the better your problem solving is likely to be . ###If you only get a few ideas , you 've only got a few things to look at . 
264641:50	###Whereas the more ideas you get , the more things you have to look at , the more chances you 've got of getting something that 's really good and unusual . ###But you do n't at any stage say , what did you say that for , you know , something like that , you just do n't do that sort of thing . 
264762:27	###Life was very difficult for him or her , and they 'd be out . ###A lot of their time was spent looking for food , was n't it ? 
264797:95	###But then you 've not used it up , and so there 's certain things that are now going to happen . ###And they can be , which is what we 're going to move on to . 
264828:43	###It just so happened that he , you know , he was alright , and the car was a right-off . ###And somebody was following , a colleague was following , saw it happen , stopped and helped him sort of do what you 've got to do to get the man 's address and this sort of thing , make sure the car was alright , and took him into the office . 
264929:8	###Yes , maybe ###Still got to have them , we 've still got to have them 
264929:77	###Yes , maybe ###Still got to have them , we 've still got to have them 
264950:69	###You know , I want you to have the chances that I did n't have . ###All these things , pushing this child on . 
264983:12	###Yes , that 's it , yes , yes . ###That 's exactly how A types see it . 
265010:24	###Now I accept that if you 're adding up a column of figures you ca n't say well it 's within a few thousand well that 'll do . ###That 's near enough . 
265011:16	###That 's near enough . ###There are some things that do have to be done to a certain standard . 
265042:57	###No , no , I noticed this programme ages ago . ###I 'll give you that , I 'll give you that , you know , when you go home , you should have known that . 
265052:44	###You wa , if you think of those soaps , I bet , I 'm convinced you could miss six weeks of the soaps and still not lose a minute of the plot . ###Probably yes , but what 's really happening is , you 're watching television and half your mind is taking it in , and the other half of your mind 's thinking , when I get back to work tomorrow , I 'm going to do so-and-so and so-and-so , because , yes , I 'll do , and you 're really chewing over the problems of today . 
265096:48	###Whatever it might be that interests you , but something that you 've got to be thinking about , in your share time . ###Er , it can be a sport it can be some sort of activity , it could be going to evening classes , learning something . 
265120:15	###You be in charge as much as possible of your time , and whatever it is you 're going to do . ###Now you might think well , what about all these people at the top then . 
265131:102	###In the higher , the higher up you go , you delegate it . ###Yes , yes , but you , it 's in a different frame of mind is n't it ? 
265147:19	###Because you can tell , you can have two people in a situation , one copes really well , sails through it , but the other gets really stressed , and goes down hill , and ca n't cope . ###It 's to do with their personality , their perception of the event , their upbringing , their beliefs all sorts of things like that . 
265163:9	###They 've decided that you need that number of weeks holiday , then that 's what you should be taking . ###And I think you 'll soon find that more companies are coming round to thinking about this now , as , it is becoming more difficult and more challenging if you like , in working in the company . 
265242:33	###There was a severe moderation of land reform policies to only rent and interest reduction with restrictions in and taxation too . ###There was a hint that this was a short term strategy , Mao at the seventh national congress in April nineteen forty five argued the C C P has made a major concession to land to the tiller . 
265250:46	###was passed nineteen forty six . ###Although the document land to the tiller it was essentially moderate in its tone and protected the interests of mi rich and middle peasants as well as industry and commerce . 
265264:46	###The involvement of land reform would bind the peasants to the communists , and these hopes seemed to be confirmed in a rise of the P L A and militia recruitments when land reform had been re redistributed the land had been redistributed . ###The C C P hoped that the peasants would increase production of food and when working on their own land because of erm because of desire to increase production , that the C C P left commerce and industry untouched . 
265280:7	###However they seemed ###to realize that it was alienating other sectors of society when the C C P could least afford to . 
265280:87	###However they seemed ###to realize that it was alienating other sectors of society when the C C P could least afford to . 
265284:104	###It never associated ma agrarian reform as an end it itself . ###Ideal ideog ideologically it was committed to a nation where private property was abolished . 
265289:263	###Erm however absolute egalitarianism showed that it could n't actually work in practice because there was n't they underestimated the amount of land which , that could be redistributed and you had leftist and rightist deviations where which meant that how that industry and commerce was being threatened and landlords were just being indiscriminately killed . ###Erm this meant that how that er erm some of the problems actually arose from the outline landlord itself er by land law itself in that it discussed land reform in very general terms and the policy towards middle and rich peasants was left unclear erm which meant that how that classes were being mis-classified and the movement was getting out of hand . 
265290:177	###Erm this meant that how that er erm some of the problems actually arose from the outline landlord itself er by land law itself in that it discussed land reform in very general terms and the policy towards middle and rich peasants was left unclear erm which meant that how that classes were being mis-classified and the movement was getting out of hand . ###Erm it may have been deliberate in that how the Par Party could n't be seen as too radical in order to maintain er as broad a support as possible and allow the peasants to erm give them leeway to do what they wanted to do , but erm it 's quite interesting though that whatever the Communist Party did , people were going to respond in which ever way they wanted to whether or not there was a law there , but they still had to sort of erm establish their legitimacy . 
265292:98	###Erm als other problems which arose from the outline land law was in its deliberate ambiguity er in its deliberate erm tt sort of ambiguity because it left reg it left the law to be interpreted by regional areas which meant that how that erm in some places they totally misinterpreted the law but the Communist Party had to have this flexibility because China was such a vast country and you could n't just impose one policy per se across the country . ###Erm the problems of the implementation of the nineteen forty seven outline land law arose from two misapprehensions by the Party leaders . 
265295:22	###Erm and two , aware of this impossibility the C C P leaders saw that the impurity of the local Party as a problem while that though this played some part erm the C C P play was actually exaggerated according to . ###He said that how that the real problem was the expansion of the C C P between nineteen thirty seven to forty seven and the inadequate training . 
265302:48	###Mao specifically said in April nineteen forty five that whoever argues absolute egalitarianism is wrong . ###Erm the Communist Party needed the approval of the majority of peasants erm before land reform could take place and there was there 's this sort of chicken and egg problem in that how that do you have land reform in order to mobilize peasant support or is it the peasant support that 's going to enable land reform t to take place successfully .

265318:59	###I mean what what what was your ###your feeling from it ? 
265378:154	###I mean there 's no oh I might , just a suggestion I ###To do what ? 
265392:89	###And there is this directive to cadres saying we are returning to land reform . ###Now I think if , if , if I 'd 've received this I 'd 've thought right we 're off . 
265412:125	###But there 's the potential for it to be interpreted quite radically and ###Right . 
265566:32	###I mean is it that the rent reduction interest rate reduction is not working and in order for the peasant to get enough for themselves , they needed to go further ? ###Or are they just greedy and saying well we 're doing quite well out of rent reduction , but if we , you know if we the landlords , we 're gonna get some more ? 
265624:78	###So obviously there are a number of ###But what they 're doing which is more important than that , they are beginning to change the way in which the peasant sees the world . 
265634:176	###So I , I do n't think it 's there er and it ca n't be created quickly enough . ###Mm yeah . 
265641:127	###The , the Party 's not gonna reduce its tax but it 's , it 's fighting the at least as expensive as fighting ###But surely the the , some of the burdens on the peasants surely gotta be less now that they 're no longer fighting the Japanese as well . 
265643:69	###But then why would Mao in nineteen forty five say that how that they 'd made a major concession to land to the tiller but that this is a correct one and they 're going to , that land reform has to be taken in stages and they 're going to first of all reduce rent and , I mean er ###Yes , that 's 
265796:73	###But we 're looking at it with hindsight , we ca n't just say that because of this this that and the other erm that pragmatism did overrule at this particular point in time . ###Oh I dunno , I dunno . 
265816:45	###Now that 's a bit of a surprise to you in the sense that you believed that ten percent of the population owned eighty percent of the land and therefore this , this kind of erm a a attack on , on the rich was happening through the May the fourth directive , that would 've produced enough to bring everybody up to a reasonable middle peasant status . ###And it does n't seem to be happening . 
265819:104	###So why were n't they getting it ? ###This is one of ' s questions is n't it ? 
265834:7	###No ###But surely that 's not possible ? 
265841:27	###Mm . ###I mean if , if , if you 've got , if , if , 
265854:76	###And therefore i i i it was n't just the poor s saying well I want the same as everybody else , I want as much as a middle peasant . ###Now wh what were , in your introduction w were you saying that there , there simply was n't enough land for that to happen ? 
265939:154	###Right . ###Fine . 
265957:7	###Exactly . ###So if , if you are a poor peasant you are thinking hold on the Party expects me to stand up to this landlord and accuse him of this this and this , actually point a finger at him when there is a chance that , you know , the Kuomintang is , is twenty miles away and they , I know they 've come into other villages as they come back , m of land to peasants.s in the form of land 
265957:108	###Exactly . ###So if , if you are a poor peasant you are thinking hold on the Party expects me to stand up to this landlord and accuse him of this this and this , actually point a finger at him when there is a chance that , you know , the Kuomintang is , is twenty miles away and they , I know they 've come into other villages as they come back , m of land to peasants.s in the form of land 
265960:9	###Because they actually allowed the , the nationalists to , to sort of drive a an attack through into villages and take over erm and they , they assumed that they would drive too far erm ###Yes . 
265972:80	###Right , okay so out of this comes a ###Yeah they realize that 
266003:80	###Do , do they conflict at all ? ###In that i i in the speech is n't recognizing some of the difficulties , is n't he recognizing the need to protect the middle peasant ? 
266020:15	###Right . ###So the law was , was implemented , it became fa clear fairly quickly that , in the process of that implementation , it did lead to encroachment on the r middle peasant . 
266082:68	###Y y you needed to right that wrong . ###Now in order to move yourself forward you might need to go to excess , you might need at least to tolerate excesses . 
266119:89	###Mm . ###erm if , if , if you , if you , if you take this view of excesses you 're not unhappy for that to happen in order to move it forward as long as you maintain the control necessary to stop it when it 's gone too far , which is exactly what he does . 
266119:181	###Mm . ###erm if , if , if you , if you , if you take this view of excesses you 're not unhappy for that to happen in order to move it forward as long as you maintain the control necessary to stop it when it 's gone too far , which is exactly what he does . 
266206:25	###Right . ###So they 've learnt that they ca n't implement land reform unless they 've got the support of the popular masses and it 's got to come from them cos ultimately they , they 're pursuing land reform in order to get the peasant support and if that 's not what they want there 's no point in just erm imposing it on them . 
266228:111	###Not do actually do the land reform themselves , but to create the conditions whereby they can believe in themselves . ###Right . 
266253:7	###Yeah . ###But I mean it 's the idea , the idea is coming , is not coming from themselves , it 's coming from the Party that , that er that you can create a system without landlords . 
266311:143	###Well it certainly has but there 's still kind of elements of ###I think especially when they find out that there 's not much land to go round as they ash assumed . 
266375:139	###Mm . ###not , which , one which would not be over in a year and a half . 
266415:9	###and you 've recognized that there are dangers if you , if you try and mobilize people too quickly i i it , it needs to be done slowly . ###But is there also the , the , the idea of , a and in a sense one thing you have n't actually got an appropriate land reform 
266434:36	###This is the difference ? ###Mm . 
266435:40	###Mm . ###You do n't have any of this sort of you have to work 
266489:79	###Yeah my problem is just erm having said that we do n't think land reform should go ahead in the south because it 's a fairly efficient set up ###Mm . 
266543:12	###Right . ###Yes . 
266546:113	###Mm . ###erm this is going to be really hard work . 
266546:143	###Mm . ###erm this is going to be really hard work . 
266550:32	###economic growth and , and ###Right . 
266553:12	###Mm . ###I E to , to , and will contribute to China 's industrialization because once we are in control industrialization will be necessary . 
266560:157	###That er that , that , I mean that efficiency thing is becoming an important consideration in a way which we , we , we 've not mentioned before . ###Mm . 
266592:30	###Erm going back to your point , we , we are operating within the context of a new democracy , right , which is , is , is broadly a kind of democratic approach erm I E that it 's , it 's an indication of a sort of the bourgeois revolution but within that you 're saying it 's not just a democratic revolution , it 's a new democratic revolution and within that there will be elements of socialism being created . ###So we , we are not just creating capitalism per se we are building in that direction er but there will be elements of socialism there which we can then build on and take us forward . 
266595:191	###Okay . ###So , so th th that would be some of the thinking which would lie behind sitting down and , and and drawing up a , a reform document a land reform document , in the very late nineteen forties . 
266626:36	###Well that 's what they said but why not ? ###Because 
266645:87	###of the personnel that ###Right . 
266708:86	###But ###to rich peasant economy . 
266847:123	###So why did they think that they had the er means to do it in nineteen forty seven ? ###You know when they said , when they went for a very radical policy 
266864:47	###erm ###I E it 's the same person who comes up with 
266880:40	###That 's right . ###And that 's what 's happening to us now 
266948:165	###Yeah and and the other thing which I , actually I 've been laughing at here is because you were laughing at yourself when you were asking the questions . ###I was thinking about all the 
267000:51	###Again the temptation to become assumptive ###Although that information would 've come out with her salary would n't it ? 
267020:168	###Mm . ###erm especially budget and so that was good . 
267027:32	###Yeah . ###yeah , so you know , get stuck in there . 
267318:17	###You 're not into any of this bunjee jumping or free fall parachute jumping of anything ? ###Oh ! 
267554:33	###Cos you can jump around you see , you can ###Yeah . 
267565:48	###wage rise ###Yeah 
267574:22	###As Maggie 's talking to me I mean you can see like my here I mean I 've got all sorts , as you would use that , those pages for , there 's notes as I 'm going through of things that we were doing and er the university and , and everything like that and there 's other parts of it that , I mean the , the things that you would come back to and elaborate more on ###Mm . 
267691:80	###Nice to see you . ###Nice to put a face to a name . 
267695:37	###How long have you been here ? ###Been here about five years . 
267725:33	###Okay . ###Erm and proceeding to business you know tell me why did you come to Friends Provident in the first place ? 
267774:18	###Now that one was for ten years ###Mhm . 
267948:48	###Telecommunications manager . ###Erm and what does that actually involve ? 
268010:21	###There 's some juice on the table . ###Yeah want some juice ? 
268110:53	###Right , I 'm a place , erm ###No , there 's no need to laugh of course she 's a place , that 's fine go on listen to her . 
268410:34	###What 's all got capital letters , Stuart ? ###Well , the names an ' that . 
268426:13	###Sir , can I have one ' cos ###Good grief you 've got through your books very quickly . 
268463:54	###Because you are saying how many ones go into ten . ###Let me write this down for you , ten divide by one is ten , because you are saying how many ones are in ten and the answer is ten , okay ? 
268514:23	###Think What is it that we 've got er nine of ? ###Nine ? 
268659:55	###Otherwise , oh , it 's just the monitor that 's off is it ? ###It 's just that otherwise when we choose the printer , we erm can I just see your screen , Liam . 
268667:75	###Mhm . ###Page down . 
268742:31	###undo table , yes it 's a very useful facility . ###If you make a mistake with Word , right , then you can always undo it , right , if you ever make a mistake do n't panic cos you can always undo it but you only get the one chance if you go on working then you ca n't undo it . 
268749:34	###Right ? ###Can I put any number like four , three point whatever ? 
268749:123	###Right ? ###Can I put any number like four , three point whatever ? 
268769:31	###This one is a bit tricky for a second question , I think I might revise this actually . ###Erm made this a bit too hard to start with . 
268769:72	###This one is a bit tricky for a second question , I think I might revise this actually . ###Erm made this a bit too hard to start with . 
269168:7	###Excellent , do you know what my research was ? ###No . 
269286:10	###So you wanna look at Prince Charles ' book do n't you . ###Prince Charles ' book , you wanna think about this guy Le Corbusier 
269299:42	###You 've got a pyramid on top of Canary Wharf , so that is classical reference ###Yeah , , I know , I know what you mean 
269354:83	###Quick . ###And that 's it basically , so you 've explained why ugly blocks of flats in the sixties and you even know cos why post-war reconstruction of London . 
269358:8	###yes , situation or more complicated word for situation the ###modern arch context 
269360:12	###you must examine the context because the situation relies on the ###this is more art , it 's like art . 
269364:11	###But you ca but people do . ###The thing is , the trouble with that is when you try and understand or argue about something like that you ca n't treat it as a work of art cos it is n't it 's a functioning building

269372:15	###wrote this instead of I do n't think you work well from diagrams they keep confusing . ###Write it in a list 
269410:29	###you 're losing your concentration , it 's very interesting but materials list there , types of building list there and I 'm going to the loo and I 'll come back . ###is that why you work so quick ? 
269490:61	###You have n't shocked me , you have n't horrified me , you have n't made me want to cry yet ###I 'm gonna talk about the son here 
269536:12	###yeah ###you can do right okay 
269688:10	###She remained in a coma for eight months , a greater part of her time at Addenbrookes . ###Once she had recovered full consciousness it became clear that she had entirely lost the power of speech . 
269741:23	###It will be necessary for me to return to Mr assessment of the quality and extent to which the parent 's contribution has helped to achieve the plaintiff 's present quality of life . ###When I deal with the cost of and care and also the cost nursing care for her future . 
269743:10	###It will be seen that I have to arrive at figures in respect of damages in this case under a number of heads . ###The first is of course that covering the plaintiff 's pain , suffering and loss of amenity . 
269745:11	###To that must be added her loss of earnings throughout her life in her chosen occupation . ###There is also the cost of care both up to today 's date given by her parents and in the future to be given by her parents and by professional carers . 
269758:92	###Only able to take part in a limited range of activities at home and particularly seriously , she is only able to hold a conversation by the laborious method of tapping out her comments on ticker tape through using her cannon communicator . ###This is a severe disability in one so young , where the speed of communication of youth is an ever present part of daily life . 
269760:101	###As Mr said in an earlier report , brackets B twelve closed brackets quote , Anna Jane is a quick witted intelligent girl and it is obviously extremely frustrating for her to have to type her conversations , unquote . ###The psychiatric report from doctor brackets B twenty three closed brackets noted that , quote , most avenues of normal life are now closed to Anna and will remain closed to her permanently . 
269768:27	###Doctor goes on when one considers her potential life in terms of an academic achievement and marriage with a family , one can only say that without a shadow of doubt she has been devastated and her emotionally devastation will I fear , increase over the years , unquote . ###For my part I entirely accept doctor assessment . 
269771:9	###As well as the fact , already mentioned , that she requires twenty four hour care . ###This , at the moment , is being undertaken by her parents . 
269771:36	###As well as the fact , already mentioned , that she requires twenty four hour care . ###This , at the moment , is being undertaken by her parents . 
269775:40	###She needs assistance to get her on and off the toilet and in cleaning herself after opening her bowels . ###She cannot brush her own hair , or clean her teeth adequately . 
269777:10	###She can drink from a beaker with a lid and straw , but has to have someone with her because of the risk of choking . ###She can hold a spoon and feed herself but only slowly and with spillage . 
269784:34	###Law of the evidence in relation to that change will be apparent when I deal with the question of loss of future earnings . ###As I have already indicated she has entirely lost the possibility of marriage , children and an enjoyable career . 
269804:7	###By multiplying five thousand one hundred and ten hours by three pounds fifty , a rate something under the full commercial rate . ###In contract Mr does not count hours , but arrives at an overall figure of seven thousand five hundred pounds . 
269847:12	###That multiplied by three point five comes to the figure of a hundred and twenty six thousand , five hundred and twenty seven pounds fifty two pence , which is the figure I would award . ###. Sub-heading care for the future . 
269863:32	###It is accepted by the medical experts on either side that a t that at twenty four , the plaintiff 's expectation life is substantially unaffected by the accident . ###The life expectancy of a girl of twenty four , according to conventional tables , is for the age of seventy nine and is thus fifty five years . 
269887:135	###Autee was a case concerning a pension scheme . ###In 
269901:46	###Sir Gordon in and nineteen seventy two sixty five page five twenty six . ###After saying that actuarial calculations were based on the performance of the average man , went on quote , the average man has an expectation of life of a certain number of years . 
269903:11	###This is a matter of probability but for purposes of actuarial calculation , it has to be treated as a certainty . ###Yet nobody can say whether an individual plaintiff is an average man or that he will live for the expectation of life of an average man of his age . 
269904:32	###Yet nobody can say whether an individual plaintiff is an average man or that he will live for the expectation of life of an average man of his age . ###Any actuarial calculation must therefore be discounted to allow for the chance that he may only live for a shorter period . 
269907:61	###It is true that there is also a chance that the individual plaintiff may live longer than the average expectation of life . ###The chances are equal either way but as a matter of calculation it can be shown that the impact of the chance of shorter life is of greater significance than that of longer life , end quote . 
269985:12	###That he had only looked through Mrs report on the day of his evidence and had taken five or ten minutes on Mrs report . ###I take full account of these defects in his evidence , but overall I found his experience of the likely care regimes introduced in cashes , in cases such as that of the plaintiff to be of assistance . 
270000:17	###I take as the third period that which follows upon the death or incapacity of the parents . ###It is probable that it will be necessary to use the services of a nursing agency at this time because the evidence satisfies me that the tasks of the advertising for , interviewing and then appointing carers on a continuing basis will not be one which the plaintiff can carry out , nor will her sister Clare by then probably married with a family and perhaps living elsewhere , be able to undertake such frequent duties . 
270024:12	###It is therefore to the sum which is to be awarded in relation to the plaintiff 's future accommodation that I now turn . ###It is , and always has been , common ground . 
270045:49	###I do not feel able to speculate as to whether or not it will recover sufficiently over the period in which we are dealing as to be again a and situation . ###I consider therefore despite Mr arguments to the contrary that the proper rate of interest to take is two percent . 
270063:32	###So that had she been able to take her history exam , she would have needed rather a good grade there , perhaps a better grade than her past performance suggested she would have attained . ###Again her mathematics O level was already a re-sit and again it might have been beyond her at that stage . 
270092:80	###We are confident in recommending her strongly to you . ###I say again that it is clear those qualities would have been idly suited , ideally suited to the career she wished to embark upon . 
270120:15	###For the third period in general management for the rest of her working life , I assess her annual salary at fifteen thousand nine hundred pounds net , to which I apply a multiplier of twelve to reach the figure of one hundred and ninety thousand eight hundred pounds . ###The total sum awarded for loss of future earnings is therefore two hundred and thirty six thousand seven hundred pounds .

270137:10	###To achieve a figure of two thousand and thirty five pounds seventy five pence for annual depreciation . ###I allow six hundred and ninety two pounds fifty five pence for standing charges excluding depreciation and thus these two heads total the sum of two thousand seven hundred and twenty eight pounds and forty pence .

270163:13	###Neither of those sums of course has to be taken into account in any of the mathematics which now have to be done to total up the awards which I would make . ###The addition of the individual awards which would be made in the course of the aju this judgement achieve the total figure of one million eight hundred and fourteen thousand six hundred and fifty two pounds and twenty eight pence . 
270168:54	###When those credits are deducted from the total figure for the awards covered by this judgement the overall total figure would amount to one million six hundred and three thousand , eight hundred and seventy four pounds and eighteen pence . ###I stop this judgement at this stage for two reasons . 
270171:100	###That is not a matter where the parties are sufficiently advanced for it to be addressed to me at this stage . ###It follows that I expressly do not give judgement at any figure at this stage but indicate merely what the findings are which I have made and what the sums which those findings lead to , are .

270271:76	###Now at this stage er it is the plaintiff 's case that Mr er considered that this caused major financial problems , because the property at Frinton was simply not one that was open to him to offer as security , it was clear that the bank would now as he saw it , on the deal that he understood that he 'd struck and he knew that without the bank 's help he would not be able to er proceed with this purchase and operate he business in the way he had wished to . ###How , how much was the bank going to provide . 
270277:63	###The courses of action open to you following letter are as follows . ###One , application could be made to the court that Mr the landlord is unreasonably withholding consent to the lease , if the court finds that this is in fact the case they will permit the assignment of the lease to you , not withstanding the landlord 's objection . 
270353:31	###Er , the second issue is did the plaintiff , Mr ask Peter to get him out of the contract between exchange and completion er that is clearly in dispute but if he did then the further issue is this , were the defendants in breach of contract in failing to advise the plaintiffs at a stage as to the effects of national condition of sale twenty two two and a way out of the contract which was open to him . ###Er , four er if the plaintiffs had been so advised , would they have taken er that way out thereby the contract and fifthly , if the defendants er were in breach of contract and your Lordship decides all those questions in the plaintiff 's favour then er what is the basis on which they are to be awarded damages . 
270365:18	###Erm , on the basis that they should be put back into the position that they would have been had there been no breach . ###Now erm I understand that , talking to my learned friend Mr this morning , that erm he will be contending for a different approach as to the basis of compensation . 
270381:140	###My Lord the the report deals with the extent of the duties which are by solicitors engaged in commercial conveyancing , er the duties that is practice and is adopted by a majority of solicitors in this field , which relates to the extent of the duty to to financial security and to advise as to er the availability if asked , of the way out of the contract and the meaning of and interpretation of the national agreement of sale . ###Now my Lord the report er in my submission goes to the issues which are at the heart of this . 
270381:162	###My Lord the the report deals with the extent of the duties which are by solicitors engaged in commercial conveyancing , er the duties that is practice and is adopted by a majority of solicitors in this field , which relates to the extent of the duty to to financial security and to advise as to er the availability if asked , of the way out of the contract and the meaning of and interpretation of the national agreement of sale . ###Now my Lord the report er in my submission goes to the issues which are at the heart of this . 
270393:91	###And that 's all part of the the evidence , the expert evidence that he will give . ###And this , are the prof professional conduct guidelines in dispute as they apply here ? 
270416:7	###as I 've heard the evidence of a number of practising solicitors and Mr committed himself . ###Mr no doubt of what is said to be the divine preference for called three . 
270417:29	###Mr no doubt of what is said to be the divine preference for called three . ###I must say that I doubt the value as it seems to me become accustomed in cases of this type . 
270450:72	###It is not , er this evidence does not go to a matter of law er er and the duty but it matter of practice and my Lord what this case is dealing with is about what if , what is or should be the practice of a solicitors engaged in commercial conveyancing as to the advice that is given to clients and er my Lord the er commercial conveyancing is obviously a matter which particularly concerns . ###Can I , can I take it this way . 
270451:20	###Can I , can I take it this way . ###Analysing your opening to me you were saying that there 's expert evidence that solicitors instructed in the purchase of a property must ask about financial arrangements and advise about them . 
270477:50	###those authors are still alive are n't they hopefully . ###My Lord in my submission it will be yes , because of there 's some er reference . 
270509:55	###That they are solicitors who would have handled the situation differently from er the defendants . ###Well my Lord the issue is that the defendants deny they were under any duty to offer any advice about financial . 
270510:140	###Well my Lord the issue is that the defendants deny they were under any duty to offer any advice about financial . ###Yes but I ca n't receive expert evidence on that because that 's the very thing I have to decide is n't it ? 
270512:9	###My Lord it will be helped in that situation in my submission by evidence from which is dealing with what is the accepted and standard practice in that solicitors in handling these forms of transactions and what advice is given my Lord undoubtedly that must be of benefit to the courts . ###I know not , it may be that Mr is saying this is something that that never it 's never I 've never understood it to be er part of my practice or part of any solicitors practice to offer such a and if we have a solicitor er who has constantly practised in his skills for a very lengthy period of time , that is saying oh yes it is because this , as far as I 'm concerned , standard advice which solicitors should give to clients transactions . 
270520:75	###It 's not about the practice of solicitors , it 's pleaded that there 's breach of contract . ###My Lord it 's pleaded that there 's common practice in the statement of claim . 
270544:55	###That is the , that is the key to it in my submission . ###Because that is what is at issue between the parties . 
270564:15	###Or or why or do we need to try this , go into this business of a fairly complicated damages assessment as part of the liability claim . ###Sorry my Lord . 
270642:36	###And what does that tell you , members of the jury , about this police force ? ###What does it tell you about their professionalism ? 
270643:29	###What does it tell you about their professionalism ? ###Now in this case the police have the burning proof we have to satisfy you of in particular three things . 
270644:10	###Now in this case the police have the burning proof we have to satisfy you of in particular three things . ###Firstly as you have probably already gathered , we have to satisfy you that there were reasonable grounds to believe that Lawrence was in the flat , the plaintiff 's flat . 
270645:12	###Firstly as you have probably already gathered , we have to satisfy you that there were reasonable grounds to believe that Lawrence was in the flat , the plaintiff 's flat . ###Secondly we have to satisfy you that in order to that flat they used only reasonable and necessary force . 
270646:33	###Secondly we have to satisfy you that in order to that flat they used only reasonable and necessary force . ###And thirdly we have to satisfy you that in the circumstances of the operation the police were justified in restraining Mr with handcuffs for the short period of time that he was restrained and in addition Mrs who you will remember was restrained in her lounge , she was told she could n't leave the lounge , again for a few minutes . 
270674:54	###The , they weighed that up . ###The idea was of staking out the estate and counting on someone at the appropriate moment . 
270677:7	###And you will do so by listening to all the other officers who will give evidence in the case . ###The this is what the police say . 
270682:176	###They risk leaving him there and him going on to do damage to personal property . ###A very serious risk . 
270683:29	###A very serious risk . ###On the other hand there was the risk which in fact materialised which is that in mounting such an operation they would frighten innocent members of the public it was open to the jury , we do n't swing from the fact that Mrs and her children were clearly frightened , no doubt about that , it must have been a terrifying experience . 
270706:82	###Finally members of the jury by way of opening tonight , ask you to be warned about two things . ###Firstly it is inevitable and natural and quite proper that you should have a sympathy , in particular for Mrs and her children and . 
270728:16	###Thank you . ###Miss could you just confirm your full name and your address ? 
270961:9	###July nineteen eighty eight escape from prison at with one other a Mr believed to have been a white Mercedes lorry near the prison . ###And obviously , for whatever relevance it is , he was later on caught because the next entry after that is in March nineteen ninety one he was released on parole from prison . 
271048:111	###Er , in my respectful submission er some of inadmissible evidence put before a jury are simply too important and too central for a jury to be directed to disregard and then safely er to the which we known that the jury will disregard them . ###If for instance this was a criminal trial as to which will rule this to inadmissibility exactly the same . 
271066:39	###Yes my Lord but postulate this situation . ###The jury comes to a conclusion that er the police er took whatever degree of reasonableness was breached , that the raid should n't have been made on the day it was . 
271072:28	###An an and to speak quite bluntly on the state of the evidence at the moment it seems that that is a very possible end to this case , in which case , in which case the jury wo n't even get round to having this matter . ###My Lord there will be as your Lordship will know , my friend and I have been er talking outside about questions . 
271088:7	###The application 's been made I did n't want to waste time before making the application and it had been ###Very well , thank you Mr . 
271149:42	###Well , the consideration first of all , is the safety to the public . ###er the next consideration is the safety of the police officers and then we also take into account that in this priority the the safety of the er the criminal and an armed operation would not be taken if it was possible to achieve the objective er in some other way . 
271302:27	###But if the document does n't exist , it does n't exist unless you can remember what the information was on that document but I would imagine . ###Only that it would have contained the information er as I 've detailed already . 
271375:98	###It involves all aspects of erm the law in relation to firearms , their issue , their use er great emphasis placed on er section three of the criminal law act in respect of the use of reasonable force . ###Their actual ability to fire a weapon , a hand gun in this case . 
271414:10	###Did you consider that ? ###Yes it was considered . 
271444:29	###The objective of the operation was to arrest Mr with the proviso that it was to be done with the safety of the public to be paramount and that the safety of the police officers and Mr was also to be considered . ###But the main objective was to search the house to see if Mr was there . 
271463:161	###That is the intention yes . ###And does that have a bearing on the time that you conduct such operations ? 
271506:81	###No . ###Well convenient time to take lunch . 
271539:22	###Now if you , if there 's a firearms officer a full time job or are there other ordinary police duties as well as . ###At the time er when I was a firearms instructor er that was the job that I did every day I went to work either firearms training or firearms operations . 
271566:54	###Yes there are certain considerations that obviously we take er we take into effect . ###And what are they ? 
271567:57	###And what are they ? ###Well obviously the fact that we er are carrying a firearm and that firearm is loaded erm has to be borne in mind at all times . 
271582:9	###And then it goes on a strict reminder . ###A firearm is to be used only as a last resort . 
271582:30	###And then it goes on a strict reminder . ###A firearm is to be used only as a last resort . 
271587:48	###Wherever practicable an oral warning is to be used before a firearm is used . ###And lastly we to individual responsibility . 
271654:7	###Into the flat itself , two . ###Are you sure you did n't take three or four or five ? 
271680:193	###It was a good it was a good question in that case . ###Yes tell the jury then tell the jury what happened with the the door opener . 
271688:7	###Just before I deal with how you get in just tell the jury what is your a approach in terms of the timing of the events . ###Once you 'd got access , what do you do ? 
271689:7	###Once you 'd got access , what do you do ? ###We have to work as quickly and as safely as we possibly can and we ca n't afford to spend five minutes er searching a house , let alone a flat . 
271803:9	###When did you arrest him ? ###In the meantime , as I recall , er I I asked him who he was and I asked his wife who he was because he had asked what we were doing in his house and when he said his house , I thought then for the first time that perhaps this was n't who er we had on the floor . 
271814:9	###There seemed little point in er a wife and a child sitting looking at their husband/father er with no clothes on . ###I mean it 's . 
271881:7	###There was mention made that we thought , or somebody thought , was in that bedroom . ###Now what , pray , were the grounds for that . 
271886:8	###But the best you can say that the jury there was some information that be in the master bedroom you do n't know where . ###I 'm sorry I do n't . 
271894:174	###At that time no , no I 'm afraid not . ###The component parts of the multiplier have been agreed as four years for the period up to the age of nineteen when he leaves school and thirteen years thereafter Mrs doctor and Mr Paul 's headmaster agree that Paul needs an enabler at school during school hours , that is classroom hours , an enabler is in effect a classroom assistant who works with him on a one to one basis to ensure that he can participate in lessons . 
271903:137	###There are nineteen full-time care staff of whom eleven are on duty in the evenings and Mr has asked for a further eleven full-time care staff , he hopes in due course to be able to have seventeen such staff on duty at any one time . ###The result of the calculation that er I think appropriate is that one finds twenty hours a week , seven pounds an hour , thirty seven weeks a year comes out I hope at five thousand , one hundred and eighty pounds , to that should be added four hundred and forty five pounds national insurance contributions and I have left the advertising fees at the same amount two hundred pounds . 
271908:49	###In the same schedule I accept Mrs suggestions for the school holidays and the rates that she gives so that one has seven thousand , eight hundred and fifty two pounds fifty times four which equals thirty one thousand , four hundred and ten pounds . ###Turning to care for Paul after the age of nineteen the approach of Mrs is very much at variance with the approach of Mrs , both agree that Paul will require a resident carer present , twenty four hours a day . 
271917:126	###To allow for those contingencies I think it right to allow the commercial rate for the twenty eight hours per week in inverted commas , parental care , rather than a discounted rate . ###That finding effectively determines the agreed figures on which damages relating to the provision of suitable accommodation in turn , it is agreed that if two carers are to live in the household , that suitable new accommodation for the plaintiff can be acquired for two hundred and seventeen thousand , five hundred pounds , the house in which he at present lives will fe fetch eighty two thousand , five hundred pounds , a difference of a hundred and thirty five thousand pounds . 
271932:181	###Mr and Mrs are as I understand it entirely satisfied with that school . ###The only fear is that the local authority who would retain responsibility for Paul 's schooling , after normal school leaving age , if he remains a child with a statement of special educational needs , might possibly say that they would no longer pay for him being at school . 
271955:121	###I have n't done precise cal computation of interest , but , erm the rough one indicate that it is something in the region of five thousand , two hundred but I quite agree with his Lordship 's figure of five , two , O , seven , total one is one , two , one , six , three , four , O ###yes 
271988:114	###I mean if , if you felt that if there were any , it 's unlikely I think but you felt that there were any dragging of the feet in relation to the structured settlement you could come back and ask the court to make orders limiting time for further discussions or whatever you thought appropriate ###well certainly one could do that , but it , it , it would preferably if my suspicions if er imposing perhaps not the right word , er define er at the outset we erm the time limits that er are envisaged for the obtaining of magistrate licence or than that I 'm 
272017:41	###yes , very well , thank you very much , well I better advised that all these take with me , thank you both very much for the ###Court rise

272210:14	###yes and I 've just verified that this witness agrees on that matter and that he has nothing to do with it , is that right ? ###correct 
272352:142	###I 'm sure , but they 're many of them are concerned about their budget because they live off a fixed pension ###I do n't know what the , the figures would be , er many of the residence actually had , had a considerable amount of er capital , because they had traded down into these properties 
272588:52	###You thought it was a good idea did n't you ? ###yes 
272602:45	###why , because it would have been unfair to charge the residence ? ###it depended on what the particular er problem was at the time , if something failed after four or five years it was then covered by insurance by the N H B C or by guarantees

273783:143	###Yeah . ###And you can see the , you can see the way in which it can be applied , if we know , erm , that there are erm , too many people of a certain age , and too few jobs , then maybe we can do something about it . 
273793:119	###And I 'd been wondering whether like I could perhaps persuade him or his boss , the professor to come along and talk to us , and let , some of their time is very full , and to them time is money . ###Mm .

273870:19	###Yes . ###It was , was it

273935:52	###The the difficulty is knowing what is going to be useful in the future . ###Mm . 
273965:137	###Landed with that topic . ###Having discovered that , I was then , in April of last year , in France , in Strasbourg , Strasbourg is Leicester 's twin city in France , and as I was wondering through near to the cathedral in Strasbourg , I found a book a book-shop , a second- hand book shop .

274065:26	###We 've already mentioned that the British National Anthem was played a lot at one time . ###This was , I suppose , the case , particularly during the war , the Second World War , er , where it was used to promote a National feeling . 
274102:15	###This is a long long way away . ###That in fact is the Chinese National Anthem . 
274113:9	###That 's actually in two parts , as you heard , and the first part is very much trying to paint a picture , I think , trying to show how beautiful the country is , and we do n't , I have n't told you yet which country it is . ###And the second one is just that little bit more lively , try to arouse people .

274294:13	###I first went , I suppose in in something like the nineteen seventies , and I can remember in those days having some difficulty getting into the country . ###Because it was a communist led country , erm , but I had , I was going to visit friends , er , and it it was , possible for us to get in . 
274301:7	###That was in something like nineteen seventy , nineteen eighty something , the the the turn of the seventies , eighties . ###Now look what had happened to the place , and I play you that because , maybe we shall never ever hear that again , because Yugoslavia cannot now exist as a State . 
274314:22	###Always on Armistice Day , on the eleventh of November , the erm , not only the Ki , the the , God Save The King , National Anthem , but also the Marseillaise was , because it was a French class were n't they , ###Yeah . 
274487:108	###I do n't deserve that forgiveness , but the God who loves me who has actually died on the cross for me has actually taken all of that away and more than that has made me new , has actually raised me as a new life with him . ###I 've been lifted out of my selfishness . 
274526:32	###So should a school like this one equip for the realities of unforgiveness of the world outside , or should it be much more generous in the way it shows forgiveness and can a school be organised so that it does actually reflect Christ 's teaching on forgiveness . ###Is this the impossible . 
274529:27	###Can we just end with a a short story about the job that I used to do before I did this one . ###When I went to the first meeting I had been appointed to the job , I went to the first meeting and there in front of me were lots of people who were managing their own schools and they were organising how to spend money that they had been allocated . 
274530:98	###When I went to the first meeting I had been appointed to the job , I went to the first meeting and there in front of me were lots of people who were managing their own schools and they were organising how to spend money that they had been allocated . ###all sorts of managing business and they had to work together and to hold group organisations . 
274530:249	###When I went to the first meeting I had been appointed to the job , I went to the first meeting and there in front of me were lots of people who were managing their own schools and they were organising how to spend money that they had been allocated . ###all sorts of managing business and they had to work together and to hold group organisations . 
274533:13	###Because everybody in that meeting was thinking about blaming other people they were actually trying to say it 's not my fault that thing come in , it 's not my fault that things are like this , it 's somebody else 's fault in a different organisation . ###It 's not us , it 's them . 
274533:84	###Because everybody in that meeting was thinking about blaming other people they were actually trying to say it 's not my fault that thing come in , it 's not my fault that things are like this , it 's somebody else 's fault in a different organisation . ###It 's not us , it 's them . 
274534:7	###It 's not us , it 's them . ###and then I had to work with these people and I knew that that was the kind of way that they were operating and I had to teach them by the way I worked but in fact it was okay to admit that we do make mistakes . 
274550:10	###No . ###No . 
274634:15	###Right , we 'll do a quick quick true or false . ###Then we 'll do some . 
274673:43	###So let 's have about six different characters , before we do it I 'd like you need drafting books , just to think of a few questions that you would ask the characters . ###So let 's have the obvious two , Romeo and Juliet . 
274757:16	###Erm Catherine ? ###Why do you think Romeo 
274757:46	###Erm Catherine ? ###Why do you think Romeo 
274783:56	###Right , Abigail ? ###after 
274858:48	###Now I said Mr Nichol I 'd to take you to that erm but the only thing is it 's after the so I do n't know how you feel if you 'd if you would rather see a performance before the exam , or you would rather see that one after the exam , or two . ###The thing is I mean if there 's only a handful of you want to go , we can maybe get the mini bus and I could just take ten of you . 
274899:11	###A shop floor worker good , yeah . ###Skilled , semi-skilled , non-skilled workers see the different levels of of livelihood that you see to be measured on sort of thing and er therefore you 've gotta good way of representing this society as a whole have n't you . 
274906:46	###Not many people from the shop floor . ###Well , I mean you may be right I ca n't be I 'm not I 'm not absolutely certain myself but er it would be nice to think that we were represented at a local authority level , yeah , by different cross-sections of our community . 
274986:152	###Hold it there Lena . ###What is your decision because these couple of verses erm are essential to our understanding of what happens next . 
275018:93	###Look at the change . ###Go back a few chapters , visit Jesus in Kaburdian and Galilee . 
275020:12	###Go and see the reaction of the people who witnessed him cure the blind man Blind Bartiamaus or Bethsiedum Go and check out what the woman who with a haemorrhage had to say about him . ###Here we 've got him being spat at and condemned to death . 
275025:9	###He was taken out of the garden at put on trial , all the others were gathered together swiftly Normally a Jewish trial would take much longer than this . ###I think it looks like he wanted to get the thing over and done with before the Sabbath . 
275084:17	###Why have n't they got the authority . ###Pardon ? 
275197:114	###Many people spread their on the road , while others put branches in the fields and spread them on the road . ###The people who were in front and those who followed behind began to shout Praise God , God bless him , name of the Lord , God bless the coming Kingdom of King David our Father , Praise God . 
275210:171	###In fact it was , it was it was required of them to get to Jerusalem at the time of the Passover for example . ###Erm it 's important that you understand that Jerusalem was very close to the hearts of every Jew . 
275242:25	###Number three , do you think any of them is in bad taste , if so what are your reasons ? ###Bad taste , do you , do you really rather disapprove anything that it is in any of them , do you think it inappropriate , not on , is there something in bad taste ? 
275345:7	###Yes , erm tha that 's that 's an explanation really of what is in the picture and somebody comments on it in in in order to suggest what the point being made is . ###Naomi ? 
275370:125	###rhetorical question is , you know is it is that a question you wanted to try to answer or are you erm ###Yeah , just any any any thoughts on that ? 
275492:14	###recording . ###Quiet . 
275664:14	###And they 're actually bought in erm , at the offer price . ###Right . 
275705:12	###It 's exactly what you said , and the other thing you said was ? ###I ca n't remember now , spread the risk , and 
275707:12	###I do n't have to get do I ? ###No 
275712:9	###Fund manager , another bonus , excellent , yes . ###O K . 
275772:64	###Ah , let me put it more clearly , because I do n't think I 've put the question clearly enough . ###Let 's say , that me as an individual , if I was erm , buying a Covermaster Plan , for twenty pound a month , the minimum premium , let 's say I could get fifty thousand pounds worth of cover . 
275789:107	###You can have a point for disagreeing because you 're right . ###Yes , erm , you get what you pay for . 
275789:137	###You can have a point for disagreeing because you 're right . ###Yes , erm , you get what you pay for . 
275813:9	###Excellent . ###A bonus for being honest on this team , and being awake . 
275821:12	###Absolutely , tried , I tried to put you off , but I did n't manage it did I . ###O K , good . 
275877:12	###Now if you look at that table , you can see that it 's set out , on the left-hand side , the age at entry , and the top , whether he pays his premiums escalating , or level . ###So the very simple question is , if I wanted a higher allocation to units , who am I asking the question to , Sue is it yours . 
275889:84	###So only twenty percent , only one fifth of this client 's premium is going to buy units in those first four years . ###So only six pounds a month is actually going to get invested in his fund in the first four years . 
275930:36	###So appropriately sold , there is no problem , but if it 's not appropriately sold , you can see that people really do , do n't get back what they put in . ###So that 's the allocation to units . 
275930:76	###So appropriately sold , there is no problem , but if it 's not appropriately sold , you can see that people really do , do n't get back what they put in . ###So that 's the allocation to units . 
275968:14	###Oh , I get , yes I see , yes . ###Erm , seven percent . 
275969:7	###Erm , seven percent . ###Seven percent , you have to add them together . 
275969:50	###Erm , seven percent . ###Seven percent , you have to add them together . 
275974:20	###She even got round giving me the wrong answer first , which I thought was quite subtle . ###Well done . 
275974:60	###She even got round giving me the wrong answer first , which I thought was quite subtle . ###Well done . 
275975:7	###Well done . ###Erm , so the next question must come to , to John , or is it Kim , it must be Andrew . 
275982:9	###Absolutely true . ###But it was n't what I was asking , so I 'm going to give you the points , but it 's absolutely true . 
275984:14	###So we must move on to Philip , no ? ###Not again . 
276027:32	###You get an extra ninety P , buying units for you . ###Alright . 
276090:43	###Yes , that 's when , that 's when they put no limit on it . ###Right , erm , Reviews . 
276156:63	###So well , how do we do it ? ###He can either erm , continue at the same level , but he pays more premiums . 
276184:38	###yes ###yes 
276201:12	###O K . ###Good , I think we 'll give you the marks for that one then John . 
276213:34	###Good . ###Well done . 
276213:42	###Good . ###Well done . 
276213:62	###Good . ###Well done . 
276221:7	###No , no , he did get the right to ###I , I 'd ask the 
276236:22	###You 're absolutely right . ###Good . 
276237:36	###Good . ###Erm , at what age must the selected period finish , Philip ? 
276271:14	###So who actually holds the reviews ? ###The company or the client ? 
276309:57	###That was bad advice , etcetera , etcetera . ###So , if the clients want to invest in a fund , they can do . 
276309:84	###That was bad advice , etcetera , etcetera . ###So , if the clients want to invest in a fund , they can do . 
276312:12	###O K ? ###Good . 
276423:61	###And the bid price , the price that the er , client . ###Yes , yes . 
276544:121	###yes ###It is available to housewives . 
276556:45	###No we did n't say that . ###Oh , you just lost two marks worth then , payable up to the end of the term or er , on death . 
276564:57	###So you do it after five years . ###Every five years , yes . 
276596:7	###You can take a proportion of it , you do n't need the five percent . ###So if you take a proportion , then what happens ? 
276642:67	###If it 's under a thousand pounds , you ca n't get the money back through funding , and the policy is void . ###Mhm 
276647:42	###Yes , before the funds are ex , exhausted . ###Yes , yes , that 's right , that 's absolutely correct , 
276655:25	###It 's a twelve month period . ###I did n't know that . 
276696:42	###Some years ago now , I left teaching , erm , and joined Abbey . ###I went on an induction course down in Bournemouth , which was all technical , er , I came back to see my first clients , and I cringed at the thought of it . 
276704:61	###In fact they were sold last year in the U K . ###Now , one three quarter inch drill bits . 
276738:10	###It 's stupid , but having said , yes , remember that . ###Now there 's another way of doing it , which done well is more powerful . 
276860:17	###Well because I 've only got the life cover , then er , that cover would disappear . ###O K 
276868:20	###O K , that 's great , yes ? ###Related to him , worried him , and offered him a solution , yes . 
276917:9	###And if you go and have a look at the tables , you find that Abbey Life actually makes your money grow faster than a lot of other insurance companies . ###And the benefits of this is that er , as you know , erm , inflation takes over , and we measure our spending power against that , five pounds in your pocket today , wo n't buy what tomorrow , what it bought this year , and next year , what it would have bought this year . 
276918:9	###And the benefits of this is that er , as you know , erm , inflation takes over , and we measure our spending power against that , five pounds in your pocket today , wo n't buy what tomorrow , what it bought this year , and next year , what it would have bought this year . ###So we have to keep ahead of that , because we 're planning the benefits for you , twenty or twenty five years ' time . 
276927:7	###Is there anything you 'd like to ask me ? ###Can you please go through it again for me . 
276998:15	###Yes , yes , good . ###Good , because you set it out , as as , er , you gave a scenario where the money would be useful to the fu , the future , so that was , that was good . 
277026:16	###You did it , you did it very well , yes , but you needed , I know you were going to , you needed to say at the end , is this important to you , or is this something you would like on your policy . ###Good , well done , Shirley . 
277038:27	###Good , well done Sue . ###Erm , yes , selected periods . 
277074:97	###Now this video , erm , was compiled by Dr. Marius Bernard . ###Dr. Christian Bernard , the South African surgeon , heart surgeon , his brother . 
277082:9	###Yes ###Oh , right , well . 
277086:7	###Oh , by the way , you 've got to work through this video . ###You know your workbooks that you 've got , he 's actually asking you a few questions relating to the statistics that er , Dr. Bernard 's going to mention , so can I ask you to get your workbooks and a pen , just so that you can jot down some of the information . 
277197:53	###And the heart of that that 's been on the M twenty five , is the patient alive or dead ? ###Twenty two years later , and there he spends , with the , was our eight heart transplant patient . 
277199:57	###Sam says before he had his heart attacks , he had five six , I 'll have to change the story . ###Twenty two years later , and there he spends , with the he was our eighth heart transplant patient . 
277237:7	###I wish I could talk longer because I 'd like to tell you about the lungs , but er , time 's still . ###A twenty four year old woman came to see me for treatment on the ward , a smoker . 
277242:11	###She says to me , I cannot continue , she 's dead already , I will never forget her face , never . ###Now what would have happened if her broker came to this convention and heard about their disease , and two years ago sold her a disease policy , that would have given her two hundred thousand pounds , on the diagnosis of the disease . 
277242:35	###She says to me , I cannot continue , she 's dead already , I will never forget her face , never . ###Now what would have happened if her broker came to this convention and heard about their disease , and two years ago sold her a disease policy , that would have given her two hundred thousand pounds , on the diagnosis of the disease . 
277242:55	###She says to me , I cannot continue , she 's dead already , I will never forget her face , never . ###Now what would have happened if her broker came to this convention and heard about their disease , and two years ago sold her a disease policy , that would have given her two hundred thousand pounds , on the diagnosis of the disease . 
277242:89	###She says to me , I cannot continue , she 's dead already , I will never forget her face , never . ###Now what would have happened if her broker came to this convention and heard about their disease , and two years ago sold her a disease policy , that would have given her two hundred thousand pounds , on the diagnosis of the disease . 
277259:35	###Have you ever seen a person with a stroke ? ###It 's not only the patient , who lies there paralysed and unable to talk , and unable to move , it involves his whole family . 
277264:12	###What I ask you and I insist , that for a great tomorrow for my patients , you tell them about it . ###Just tell them about this product , what it can do , and I assure you of the results . 
277264:92	###What I ask you and I insist , that for a great tomorrow for my patients , you tell them about it . ###Just tell them about this product , what it can do , and I assure you of the results . 
277270:7	###Twenty one cancer , and nine percent strokes . ###It varies from cancer , in world statistics . 
277296:93	###Do you know what , they said it 's not justified , tell that to the young farmer of thirty four with a dread disease , his policy when we pay him two hundred thousand pounds in his hospital bed . ###Say to him it 's not justified on his policy , I want the money back . 
277336:56	###Carol , or not ? ###N , er , no , probably no , because we 've just , we 've just got , we 've got three spots , which are ta , are taken most of the week you see , so it 's just a bit yes . 
277364:18	###It 's a very powerful message is n't it ? ###I mean think er , life assurance erm , obviously it 's the to have fails , but if somebody is eligible for , and can afford living assurance , it 's got to be a brilliant product . 
277385:15	###When you look at er , the critical illnesses that are covered , heart attacks , cancer , stroke , etcetera , etcetera , etcetera . ###I mean is there anybody here , who honestly ca n't think of anybody who they know , I mean , perhaps if I try and rephrase that , is there anybody here who cannot think of somebody who 's suffered an illness that fits into that critical illness er , category . 
277426:12	###They take them away at night in Telford , so you only see them ###So it 's a brilliant product and there 's got to be a need for it . 
277441:9	###This is quite useful for you to refer to , this booklet , but do please tell your clients you 're not a doctor , it 's very much up to the client 's doctor and our medical underwriters , as to whether we pay out or not . ###This is just a guide , but a very useful guide . 
277478:12	###A client that 's already got some insurance . ###Absolutely , and they can actually retain that policy with you that evening . 
277569:12	###Single people . ###Single people , brilliant is n't it ? 
277594:24	###Why 's it built into the first life assured ? ###It 's likely the first life would be the man . 
277749:15	###There 's other associates who like to know beforehand roughly how much they can provide for people by way of life cover and living assurance , so that they can give the people some idea , or maybe want to sit in front of them and use the rate book to give them some idea . ###Until you 're in a situation where you 've got your own lap-top computer , and you can tell them instantly . 
277763:42	###Erm , if you look at this you can see it 's set out first of all in escalating premiums and level premiums , O K , that 's straightforward enough . ###You can see that the page is entitled Covermaster for ten thousand pounds sum assured , so basically whatever figures are quoted underneath are for every ten thousand pounds of life cover available to your client , so it you want forty thousand you multiply by four etcetera . 
277800:35	###Can we charge somebody seventeen pounds seventy for a policy ? ###No there 's a minimum premium . 
277849:54	###yes , that 's right . ###, three pounds eighty , that 's thirty one pounds eighteen , is that , that 's right , good . 
277883:20	###Erm , let 's say you had a client who knew how much they could afford to spend , so what you were doing then was you 'd tell them how much life cover you could afford . ###So let 's start simply , let 's say your client could actually afford forty two pounds a month . 
278023:16	###No , I was just asking . ###yes , it 's tonight , it 's filling in the application form , but we 're asking you to read the scenario so you know a little bit about the people , and then this is all the information that 's been gathered . 
278123:49	###Yeah as far as I know ###unclear 
278134:7	###This is where the grey areas comes in ###Well I mean I do n't care how they define their , their descriptions . 
278183:41	###There was no-one covering that area ###Well 
278205:15	###Yeah ###to avoid repetition 
278206:11	###to avoid repetition ###you see we have to be a bit careful because what happens if we closed down right and transferred out to the field 
278207:10	###you see we have to be a bit careful because what happens if we closed down right and transferred out to the field ###And then we have to change our structure 
278207:51	###you see we have to be a bit careful because what happens if we closed down right and transferred out to the field ###And then we have to change our structure 
278208:17	###And then we have to change our structure ###Then we have to change again and that 's what you 're saying we have to be a chameleon 
278213:29	###Well I do n't see , I do n't know why we 're , we 're trying to ###No what I 'm saying is the logistics , the logistics of servicing with a field of national account departments is going to be a potential nightmare 
278213:71	###Well I do n't see , I do n't know why we 're , we 're trying to ###No what I 'm saying is the logistics , the logistics of servicing with a field of national account departments is going to be a potential nightmare 
278213:133	###Well I do n't see , I do n't know why we 're , we 're trying to ###No what I 'm saying is the logistics , the logistics of servicing with a field of national account departments is going to be a potential nightmare 
278262:48	###If we 're gonna do a deal then we , we , we have some to drive it through but what I 'm saying is that I think that if you have this meeting I , which is what February the second ? ###mm 
278265:12	###well we are thin on the ground and limited resources so we do n't want doubling up , that 's what we do n't want , doubling up , but I do n't , I do n't ###I do n't think we should mirror just for the 
278269:7	###Yeah ? ###Right then well I think that 's the easiest otherwise we gonna waste a lot of time 
278338:98	###well if it is n't yeah , if we , if and I thought it was national account which means it 's a multi-locational site which it is ###mm 
278338:210	###well if it is n't yeah , if we , if and I thought it was national account which means it 's a multi-locational site which it is ###mm 
278373:57	###I think basically ###but how I structure my department would depend in all honesty on the type of people we get knows this . 
278401:12	###They 're not quite clear at all . ###I can hear that just in the last ten minutes 
278402:16	###I can hear that just in the last ten minutes ###Yeah , I must admit 
278416:18	###I think we 've got to ###Because we need at least one person to do it , it 's go it 's getting out of control now 
278448:42	###Yep ###Alright 
278545:16	###This is an outside candidate ###Oh beg your pardon I 'm sorry I thought you said internal right 
278570:82	###yeah but she also , that we a tough course ###and she was very ill at the time was it ? 
278616:21	###No what I 'm saying is we 'd have the right people if we pay more money , that 's the core of the problem ###That 's moving the flipping goalposts is n't it ? 
278645:10	###What does that mean ? ###Well , she 's quiet and quite steady 
278645:24	###What does that mean ? ###Well , she 's quiet and quite steady 
278685:7	###I think we I think the only way we can actually really do this is is to pick one from area , one from your area , one from area and one from Europe and just have er almost arbitrary er decision but justify it . ###Fucking hell 
278698:151	###Which is a very er ###do n't pre-judge it has gotta decide , you 've gotta decide your area , that 's one north , one south . 
278698:158	###Which is a very er ###do n't pre-judge it has gotta decide , you 've gotta decide your area , that 's one north , one south . 
278749:48	###What about er then ? ###well the have agreed the contract . 
278769:89	###Well fair enough ###I just hope she 's got it right cos I 've explained it all to her and sh 
278832:27	###Some sports jackets and denim suits are quite smart and these would be quite acceptable to the group of companies . ###What is not acceptable are jeans with holes in the knees etcetera . 
278954:21	###As regards the purely administrative side , I can see no problem at all , can see no problem . ###Erm , it 's extremely highly automated both in respect of the agents and the reporting and everything which er says will actually be very good for them . 
278983:126	###It 's not really made it clear that it 's for bookings and reservations as well . ###It 's not made it clear . 
279011:23	###all that off her own back y' know , only a little thing but she 's doing that as well ###Yeah 
279049:54	###Well that 's fine , do n't worry we 'll get round it . ###Just just for a couple of weekends to see how many actual calls we do get . 
279063:270	###Right okay . ###Right we 'll leave it at that then . 
279105:65	###It 's completely comprehensive and really the only thing I would say in addition to that is er there are further meetings coming up . ###Erm somehow or other it 's going to come along and I think most people 's thinkings are that it will be shown as a tax item on the ticket as are the taxes in other countries 
279218:7	###Just the sort of wrong time you know ###who wants to go somewhere when the channel tunnel 
279250:23	###We do n't need two services f for the from Aberdeen to one half an hour after the other . ###Why does n't it cut out airport and fly one less stop you know . 
279367:13	###Yeah in other words yeah , we we you 're gonna complain and to not send them a cheque you give them two free seats which we know the cost of that is is minimal . ###Nevertheless if they were going to fly again they were gonna pay for a seat and they 're only looking for some recompense towards a new new ticket what 's wrong with sending them a voucher y' know , a properly produced voucher that we c that 's controlled properly by and all they do is guarantee any travel at their normal travel agent , do the business , attach the voucher to the B S P 
279467:176	###what did he say ###He said yes 
279497:10	###Yep ###right a and get them some of the skills that 're required and hopefully that 'll help out 
279509:7	###cos they smoking together in the afternoons y' know ###Surely the the erm y' know harmony in the work place and all that . 
279509:14	###cos they smoking together in the afternoons y' know ###Surely the the erm y' know harmony in the work place and all that . 
279509:25	###cos they smoking together in the afternoons y' know ###Surely the the erm y' know harmony in the work place and all that . 
279559:55	###erm is not talking to in the first place ###No surely 
279560:40	###No surely ###not ideal so we say to you it 's not ideal so the supervisor , so you have to say to , this has gotta be sorted , this is not ideal , this is n't gonna work when you 're not here . 
279573:15	###D' you think there 's anything further in me considering my ideas of them having half an hour not working session a week ? ###if they 're not speaking to each-other 
279575:10	###No but they 'll have to then wo n't they ? ###They ca n't just sit there and saying nothing . 
279588:23	###no way ###no way 
279604:37	###and we do n't we needed her before because we had one typist , we do n't need that now , we c we can cover ###the thing is that 
279642:50	###girls have a tendency to do that sort of thing do n't they ? ###They do n't they bear grudges do n't they and they do n't go away but 
279711:51	###phase one to use your words in res ###now we need phase two I think 
279764:12	###Makes a lot more sense , O K ###At Mercury , he clocked the sponsorship erm , late last year . 
279810:60	###Mhm , and told them that you would n't be your present arrangement ###Erm , yes , quite 
279981:38	###I I was asking under two Chairman . ###Sit down old chap 
280046:7	###It was not . ###No it was , it was in the time limit . 
280049:7	###I would like the members of this authority to to have a look at the reply I make no apology for the length of the reply to Mr ' s very important question . ###On erm what you have asked for Mr . 
280085:25	###Some of them have asked me about my parentage , some of them have asked me whether or not I am tinkering with the laws of God . ###I will extract those to one side and say they not really followers of the hunt , they are probably some weird faction that latch onto these type of things during erm these issues . 
280094:109	###I want to answer the questions on jobs . ###Those jobs can be protected , I know the hunting fraternity say they do n't want to drag hunt . 
280100:83	###The general public are saying no . ###Time has come for a change . 
280106:28	###But I would like to point out in this video , and on the brochure that goes with it , actually says the rest of the field are there to follow on horseback or on foot or by car , very few people indeed actually witness the death of a fox . ###The followers are there for a day out in the countryside , the opportunity to ride or to walk freely over private property with the consent of the landowner . 
280170:8	###From them . ###They do not have the right to choose because they , they virtually , the the hunt has always ignored their wishes . 
280171:18	###They do not have the right to choose because they , they virtually , the the hunt has always ignored their wishes . ###They have to buy and sell their produce in that community and there are restrictions operating on that . 
280171:50	###They do not have the right to choose because they , they virtually , the the hunt has always ignored their wishes . ###They have to buy and sell their produce in that community and there are restrictions operating on that . 
280198:115	###I 'd like to start before I explain that , just to refer to a few comments that Mr made . ###Mr made a comment about Moats and Highfield . 
280210:157	###The nature of erm , subsidies from Europe and all others , other factors . ###I think this argument 's about the benefit of the countryside is somewhat debatable to say the least And these arguments that are put about why we should n't ban fox hunts because of all the benefits and the tradition are exactly the same arguments that were put about otters and about badgers and about other sports that we have , that we no longer consider satisfactory and have opposed . 
280240:20	###It may well pass an act against it soon , it may well be that a lot of people from over there will get elected and you 'll get your bill , but then again it may not . ###Yes , yes 
280255:110	###My history books told me about those wicked aristocrats of the nineteenth century , they used their position as landlords to force their tenants to , to vote in a certain way , to force their tenants in other words to take up a particular position on a matter of controversy . ###Near time . 
280261:26	###Thank you Chair . ###I would like to support the motion put in the name of Mr and I would like to speak against the amendment . 
280277:150	###Thank you er . ###Can I first of all congratulate my colleague Graham , Graham on his measured speech , he 's certainly given us many things to , to think about and things that should be investigated . 
280282:23	###I think erm it is worth saying Chairman , it has n't been mentioned yet , er that in fact we 're talking about the the tenant farmers and their livelihood . ###Most of the tenant farmers i in this county I believe are dairy farmers and in fact they have their life savings tied up in their stock . 
280282:162	###I think erm it is worth saying Chairman , it has n't been mentioned yet , er that in fact we 're talking about the the tenant farmers and their livelihood . ###Most of the tenant farmers i in this county I believe are dairy farmers and in fact they have their life savings tied up in their stock . 
280283:15	###Most of the tenant farmers i in this county I believe are dairy farmers and in fact they have their life savings tied up in their stock . ###They , they know what they have to do to protect that stock , to protect their life 's interests and they , and they know they do n't need to be told really by any officer here who are not in that not , not in that game , what they have to do that 's what they 're asking us to do and they certainly asked us to do that on the erm , on the tour of county farms that we had only , only a few weeks ago . 
280306:39	###So , those who do not support hunting will do nothing practical to protect foxes , if they vote for this motion today in that respect it is and I suggest the people who move it know that it is , nothing but sanctimonious twaddle . ###They would be voting to divert attention from the one place where the merits or otherwise of fox hunting should be decided and considered amongst M Ps , you will note amongst M Ps not by government , this is a matter for a free vote of conscience . 
280347:64	###The debate on fox hunting has become unnecessarily complex and that can only suit the pro hunters because the basic objections to hunting are obscured . ###The more complicated you make the issues , the more the basic objections become obscured . 
280379:14	###But what I hate above all is this constant sanctimonious attitude of the socialists that they think they know best and their continuous craving to create a nanny state . ###I cannot vote for the banning of fox hunting on county council land as I see this as another attempt to limit freedom of choice . 
280393:14	###I ca n't believe knowing er some of the people who do hunt , that their motive is actually that they want to see a fox torn to pieces . ###I believe the motive is in fact the enjoyment of riding a good horse fast over open country and I can understand that . 
280396:187	###If their motive actually is er to enjoy seeing a fox torn to pieces er then I suggest to them er that is unbearable cruel there are of course objections to er this motion and to its further extension the banning of fox hunting altogether . ###We are told that foxes are vermin and it is necessary to hunt them down . 
280429:32	###The age old argument about the damage that a fox does in a hen coup is clearly un unfounded ###A farmer who allows a fox to get into his hen coup deserves everything he gets . 
280440:40	###Institutions enjoyed equally by all countrymen , I again emphasise that in the hunting field social distinctions do not exist and those who follow houn hounds start equals receiving consideration exclusively through their own merits . ###However , what is the lynchpin as I see it , of the debate today is the deprivation of civil liberties as proposed by the Labour group . 
280482:101	###We are talking here about the rights of the tenant farmers to use the land which they have from you and what do you suggest that it be done ? ###At the moment the tenant has the right to ban any fox hunting from his f er er land if he wants to . 
280572:29	###The strengths of using written communication is that it 's on paper there 's a record , of course that can be a weakness sometimes , be careful what you put down , it means more you get hold of more than one person you 've said it to more than one person who can be quite difficult to get hold of . ###Okay . 
280573:124	###Okay . ###it can be read whenever it does n't have to be read as soon as it 's rel received . 
280575:16	###You can make sure you can take time to make sure you get it right you get the information right gives you chance to formulate new ideas and put things in a different way until they have to be too many drafts . ###It can really be helpful if it 's complicated and detailed information , notice the difference between complicated and complex . 
280599:83	###not a lot cos you know in the department I 've got it 's ah we 're in touch with all of the suppliers and all the sub- contractors ###right 
280739:37	###You know here we come down to very basic premise of communication ###yeah 
280887:49	###what 's the difference what stops you being what stops you ###It 's not knowing who I can be assertive with 
280894:71	###I I find that I am assertive whereas at times I should n't be in fact most of the time I should n't be and I am ###and I 'm the opposite 
280925:12	###I do n't think so , really it 's just the opposite problem of what we 've got over here , being submissive now we all know what being being sub submissive yes we let people walk all over us we do n't say yeah we we listen to what everybody else says and therefore the opposite is you 're gonna get aggressive to get what we want . ###They 're both two sides of the same coin y' know , being aggressive is n't what it 's all about , being aggressive certainly is n't what it 's all about . 
280927:12	###You do n't have to be aggressive to be assertive , look at some of these comments we 've got here how confident you are in yourself and how you put your point across . ###How you put your point across getting your point across and not being afraid of doing it , doing it effectively putting the point across , being positive in putting your point across so it 's all about putting your point across effectively , clearly congruously i.e. my body says what I mean . 
280927:31	###You do n't have to be aggressive to be assertive , look at some of these comments we 've got here how confident you are in yourself and how you put your point across . ###How you put your point across getting your point across and not being afraid of doing it , doing it effectively putting the point across , being positive in putting your point across so it 's all about putting your point across effectively , clearly congruously i.e. my body says what I mean .

280947:154	###Apparently , I mean I 've read this , but I do n't know how there was actual references to it as well but apparently what they used to do run a test they used to do was they used to get people very very angry take some blood from them , put put them inside of rats and it would kill the rats . ###So you know there 's the , do n't link aggression with assertion , two difference . 
280947:174	###Apparently , I mean I 've read this , but I do n't know how there was actual references to it as well but apparently what they used to do run a test they used to do was they used to get people very very angry take some blood from them , put put them inside of rats and it would kill the rats . ###So you know there 's the , do n't link aggression with assertion , two difference . 
280954:109	###Now this other person is trying to trying to change the conversation , trying to take you away from what you 're trying what you want done . ###What I want you to do as as the person who 's being assertive is to stick to the point . 
281037:12	###If we look at a relationship or any type of communication as a situation where somebody 's going to win and somebody 's going to lose there 's not gonna be much chance of two people working together on that so what happens is somebody 's got to lose . ###Nobody wants to lose and if nobody wants to lose it means it gets fiercer and it goes on for longer and it does takes a long time to resolve , if it ever is and often to the detriment of one person to the success of another . 
281146:182	###that 's a team worker , alright , okay . ###You know that 's really why why we 've got so many team workers is n't it ? 
281147:66	###You know that 's really why why we 've got so many team workers is n't it ? ###And I mean I put an asterisk down there to say that 's what I thought was going to come out quite heavily simply because this is is the case on these courses , you know the people that we get on these courses every single one of these that we 've had , and we must have had coming up to what over ten now , every single one we 've had people that the most the majority of people have had team work very high on the score . 
281206:17	###Their presence is a detraction in the group because they 're not willing to add to the group you know you 've got to have this attitude if you 're in a group well the attitude you need to help the group is how can I help that group ? ###And not I should n't be here I really do n't know what I should be saying I really have n't got as much knowledge as everybody else that does n't matter , if you 're in a group it does n't matter what you know and what you do n't know there 's still things going on within that group that you can contribute to 
281211:56	###If you had a predominance of company workers where everybody run around following the rules well there 'd be nobody else to do anything else . ###erm Chairman chairpeople you need one or two chairmen chairmen so you can actually pull the whole thing together and keep the group together . 
281212:36	###erm Chairman chairpeople you need one or two chairmen chairmen so you can actually pull the whole thing together and keep the group together . ###Plant , we 'll you 've got to have your crea creativity from somewhere your ideas have got to come from somewhere that 's the plant . 
281215:39	###Monitor evaluator to actually check and to give you the pessimistic side of everything to break everything down why it wo n't work why this should be done why that should be done instead . ###Team worker to make sure everybody 's working together and happy . 
281278:30	###You had no reason to think that was er sleeping with the man 's wife I say again ###No 
281279:7	###No ###Is n't it obvious within a second that you must be looking at the husband and wife ? 
281281:7	###I have to say again I 'm sorry no it it was n't obvious to me at that time definitely not . ###You thought it , is this right , you thought it could be it could be ? 
281326:9	###No not at all my Lord . ###In fact er just prior to the start of the operation er I made a decision to change the shotgun holders over . 
281335:7	###Oh . ###Can you remember now who the shotguns were originally issued to ? 
281336:113	###Can you remember now who the shotguns were originally issued to ? ###I have to say I 'm afraid I ca n't erm I have thought about this yes . 
281364:19	###With respect er I was n't paying too much attention to er to what was being said in as much as this possibly sounds negative but our concern is not for what people are shouting at us our concern is for whether we 've got a threat er in a particular area , in this case the bedroom , and whether we can try and sort that threat out before somebody is injured . ###Whether it 's us or an innocent member of the public . 
281375:16	###Along those lines my Lord yes . ###Yes . 
281388:22	###You see I am , you can see what I 'm suggesting to you , there 's not much point in an armed officer guarding an eleven year old child it would have been obvious to go to the master bedroom , but you deny it . ###Right , the reason that er an officer would still stay er with an eleven year old child , a three year old child , or t to get to the realms of fantasy a ninety year old person is that person can still be at risk not necessarily from the police officers , but from anybody else in that building and therefore they 've got to remain er in that room until such time as I 'm satisfied that everything is clear . 
281390:8	###Again something that I just have to put . ###It was n't you who helped Mr get some trousers on that was done by the C I D when they arrived ? 
281425:34	###And finally , erm again we 've been told that you either not remembering or you 're lying about the trousers . ###Is that something you can easily forget , pulling a man 's trousers on when he 's got handcuffs on and lying on his front ? 
281572:189	###He then moved forward to the person on the ground and handcuffed his hands behind his back . ###And whilst he was doing that operation where was P C ? 
281576:10	###After the man was handcuffed did PC do anything else ? ###Erm yes he , I believe it th th that stage was when er he said we 'll put y we 'll pus we 'll find some clothes for you mate erm , I I do recollect P C going I think to the foot of the double bed or near to the base of the double bed where he found a pair of erm jeans and I do remember him checking the pockets erm and then helping or trying like put the jeans on on the man that was lying on the ground still handcuffed . 
281781:19	###That 's correct sir , P C was behind the shield like he was told to be . ###And somehow missed the sledgehammer . 
281860:7	###Yes we looked in the er wardrobe , there were a built-in wardrobes there . ###Did you take it he was still a whether there was an armed man or any sort of man in that ? 
281860:64	###Yes we looked in the er wardrobe , there were a built-in wardrobes there . ###Did you take it he was still a whether there was an armed man or any sort of man in that ? 
282059:10	###Presumably with room for somebody to hide underneath it . ###Yes . 
282059:19	###Presumably with room for somebody to hide underneath it . ###Yes . 
282073:19	###Yes . ###So both of you were standing 
282094:13	###Must have been . ###At that point were both of you behind the shield or had he stepped out from behind ? 
282095:26	###At that point were both of you behind the shield or had he stepped out from behind ? ###He would have had to have reached out . 
282102:89	###And the bed was tipped . ###Yes and then replaced on its legs . 
282117:22	###Now I believe you 've got one more witness have you . ###One more my Lord . 
282165:10	###I 'm most impressed also with the hard work , the dedication and the , the sheer efficiency of the director general and his top team . ###I was talking , yesterday as it happened , to the chairman of another very large children 's charity and I asked him how his , the spend , the annual spend of that charity was distributed between the work of the charity , the purpose of the charity and the support functions and he said about eighty twenty . 
282172:61	###I 'd like to pay a tribute to the courage of our people there , both the indigenous er workers for the fund and the ex-pats who 've gone out there to lead that work . ###We 're in touch with them every day , they refuse to leave and we 're very grateful to them for their efforts . 
282178:53	###People without whom we would n't be able to raise so much money . ###It 's your tireless efforts as fund raisers that enable Save The Children Fund to survive . 
282207:22	###Lesotho is one of eight countries across the globe in which Save The Children has introduced the riders for health project , working with the ministry of health , a successful programme has been developed which provides primary health care to almost five times as many villages that could have been reached on foot . ###The Save The Children Fund programme with the motorcycles has made a very big difference to the number of visits that health assistants can make to villages . 
282278:30	###I 'd now like you to hear directly from a young person for whom access to one of our projects in the United Kingdom has made major changes in her life . ###To Caroline home is a room for her possessions , abandoned by her Mum and Dad as a baby , she spent her life moving from one set of parents to another . 
282406:96	###The need for sustainable health , education and welfare services is as acute as ever . ###Children in the United Kingdom face different sorts of problems but they too are under threat . 
282421:36	###For health and welfare most villages depend on village healers . ###But unless this is combined with techniques like vaccination and knowledge of oral rehydration , diseases like measles and diarrhoea are child killers . 
282440:39	###So where do we start with the mammoth task of raising an additional twenty five million pounds ? ###I have little doubt that nineteen ninety four , ninety five will be a challenge , especially in today 's economic climate . 
282446:10	###This is a first for The Save The Children and we will be approaching wealthy individuals , foundations and trusts for donations towards our work . ###That will not be easy because most of them are heavily involved in funding of all sorts of other organisations and they have their own interests . 
282474:7	###It is going to be hard work . ###Nobody would pretend that raising an additional twenty five million pounds is going to be easy but time and again you have risen to the challenge . 
282651:87	###A fund raising idea of Judy , a volunteer from Scotland , the actual birthday is the nineteenth of May , as you know , to mark this we are asking all our supporters to hold a party for us on that day , or as near to it as possible . ###It 's a wonderful opportunity for volunteers in shops and branches and one-off groups to contact all the people who 've supported them and Save The Children over the years . 
282701:7	###Er that 'll be one and six please . ###American Express ? 
282714:36	###The base of the cake was the branches , us , the foundation of Save The Children Fund , doing what we usually do but doing it very , very well and very professionally , the fetes , the coffee mornings , the fashion shows , the sort of thing that our reputation is built on . ###And then there was the second tier of the cake , something a little bit different , something a little bit more special for the seventy fifth year but still perhaps working on the tried and tested . 
282735:51	###It makes all the difference to the members of the public and the good will that it builds up is terribly important . ###The other things that are important are no cups of coffee , no sticky buns on the table er my helpers do n't wear trousers or leggings because helpers , like the goods , come in all sorts of shapes and sizes and some of them look good and some of them do n't . 
282831:127	###Last week last Thursday saw the launch by the disasters emergency committee , of which Save The Children is a part , of another appeal for Africa . ###Among the ten African countries for which the appeal was made , there was a mix of hope , on the one hand , hope for progress in Eritrea or Liberia , Mozambique or Ethiopia and on the other hand , countries of despair Somalia that we 've heard about today , or southern Sudan and of course , Angola . 
282937:73	###Now this may not be the most compelling subject but it is important for you to know that throughout our term in office , we 've not left you on your own as you carry out the task of raising funds for your programme . ###Now may I say one or two words about our various several of our bilateral programmes and er perhaps I will start with er saying a word or two about what the O D A is doing in Eastern Europe . 
282953:118	###In Russia for example we intend to launch a small partnership fund to support small projects promoted by the voluntary agencies in the United Kingdom who 've developed a wide range of connections with their Russian counterparts . ###A substantial number of British N G Os are already responding the challenges of Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union and many more including er yourselves are beginning to pay er attention to it . 
282961:7	###Now in the years nineteen ninety one to nineteen ninety two Britain spent four hundred and five million pounds of its financial aid programme in Africa , about forty percent of the total and we shall continue to respond to the demands and challenges that Africa presents . ###But external assistance alone cannot deliver sustainable development and st political stability . 
282966:101	###Private investment , domestic and foreign needs to be increased and the public sector made more efficient and effective . ###We need to improve the quality of public expenditure with more money on primary health care and education and less on defence and parastatal subsidies . 
282984:8	###A free press and the close scrutiny of freely elected assemblies will help to root out corruption and mis-management . ###A conscious decision is needed to get government out of things the private sector does better and to concentrate government on the basic things that only governments can do . 
282984:63	###A free press and the close scrutiny of freely elected assemblies will help to root out corruption and mis-management . ###A conscious decision is needed to get government out of things the private sector does better and to concentrate government on the basic things that only governments can do . 
282985:104	###A conscious decision is needed to get government out of things the private sector does better and to concentrate government on the basic things that only governments can do . ###It must for example , ensure an independent judiciary , provide health and education services , basic infrastructure and maintenance and it must bring about the economic environment that allows the private sector to create jobs and growth . 
283015:9	###It 's because of this particular challenge that O D A funded er the S C F 's recent report on children and income generating programme . ###I welcome the recommendation in this report that income generating programmes for children need consideration but with great care in their design . 
283022:7	###The challenge of meeting all children 's needs and of helping them achieve their rights can only be met by concerted efforts of governments of multi-lateral agencies and bi-lateral donors , as well as by the path-breaking initiatives of N G Os such as Save The Children . ###I look forward to continuing our partnership . 
283037:228	###At least everyone can hear , right ? ###Good morning then , ladies and gentlemen , and welcome to this annual general meeting of the National Council for Voluntary Organisations . 
283078:7	###Among the initiatives which we have undertaken this year , is the establishment of a working party under the Chairmanship of Lord Nathan , to make recommendations on developing and maintaining high standards of effectiveness and efficiency within the sector . ###Matters under consideration include the role and training of trustees , fundraising , management education , public relations and financial accountability . 
283140:69	###Against these dramatic changes , we intend to remain at the centre as an effective resource for the voluntary sector , and an important bridge between the sector and others . ###Voluntary organisations , speaking on the basis of our wide experience in local communities and in national life , are an influential voice which is respected throughout society . 
283165:94	###I had hoped this year to be able to report a turn round and some substantial progress towards our target of achieving a nil deficit for the financial year nineteen ninety-one ninety-two . ###In fact though , we have merely halted the trend of increasing deficits rather than reversed it , and the deficit for the current year is three hundred and forty four thousand . 
283166:7	###In fact though , we have merely halted the trend of increasing deficits rather than reversed it , and the deficit for the current year is three hundred and forty four thousand . ###The reasons for this deficit are largely associated with the , the trend of pay and price increases outstripping our income , and outstripping our projections of what we would have to spend . 
283167:118	###The reasons for this deficit are largely associated with the , the trend of pay and price increases outstripping our income , and outstripping our projections of what we would have to spend . ###I have to say also that the future looks even tougher for us . 
283174:59	###The appeal fund contributed two hundred thousand which is its target for annual income . ###The balance was met from the legacy fund . 
283175:67	###The balance was met from the legacy fund . ###Overall if you look at the balance sheet , it still appears quite healthy , erm , nevertheless , I must point out that the balance sheet is composed largely of funds with specific purposes , and these specific purposes do not include simply propping up deficits on the mainstream activities . 
283176:111	###Overall if you look at the balance sheet , it still appears quite healthy , erm , nevertheless , I must point out that the balance sheet is composed largely of funds with specific purposes , and these specific purposes do not include simply propping up deficits on the mainstream activities . ###So we ca n't use the funds in our balance sheet , simply to carry on the way we are , we have to change . 
283178:71	###And we need to use the reserves that we do have in the balance sheet , we need to spend them wisely in order to achieve our objectives , our objectives for change , and we must recognise that they can only be spent once . ###Nevertheless I would like to end on , on a brighter note , erm , those of you who are avid students of the accounts will have spotted the contingent liability of twenty eight thousand six hundred and sixty . 
283272:22	###In general terms the narrow range of investments are fairly , very safe and secure investments , but they are ones which are less likely to secure higher returns but of course also , less likely to secure risks of low returns . ###The wider range is erm , what might be termed more speculative investments , but there are many shares available within the wider range which are in fact extremely sound and safe investments , and the sort which we as trustees would wish to invest in . 
283273:7	###The wider range is erm , what might be termed more speculative investments , but there are many shares available within the wider range which are in fact extremely sound and safe investments , and the sort which we as trustees would wish to invest in . ###Now at , at the moment we have to keep fifty percent of our investments in the narrow range and we may place fifty percent in the wider range . 
283276:34	###The , the result of this , this constraint on us is that it reduces our opportunity to secure the best returns available . ###There are better returns available from wider range investments than from narrow range investments , and better returns without unnecessarily increasing our risks . 
283304:137	###There are however , a number of safeguards in that resolution . ###In particular the resolution requires that we the trustees , should establish clear policy guidelines , and the investment panel I hope , will very shortly be able to do that . 
283335:40	###Jeffrey , Adrian . ###If , if as I understand it , it 's a matter of law , and the practice will be much as just suggested , is that a correct er , interpretation . 
283348:13	###It is for people properly funded by a democratic enabling local state and under con , the control of those who have no pecuniary interest in the development of care . ###Voluntary organisations er , can do this and are in the best place to undertake this . 
283353:17	###Voluntary organisations , as Diana and her colleagues said , should have the confidence to suggest that although under the right conditions and with the right resources , er , they may be able to do the impossible , miracles are not on offer . ###The communitarian state would provide those resources to in , in , to do what perhaps has been traditionally seen as the impossible , but it will require extensive support . 
283356:27	###If not voluntary organisations may be able to obtain some of those from the private sector if they know where to look . ###Perhaps C V S 's can act as er , brokers for relevant professional services . 
283358:23	###But the important thing is that the voluntary sector must hijack the trends from the old statism to the new individualism , and steer it into a better way . ###We 've got to be pro-active about this , it 's no good simply sitting back and waiting for whatever government is in power , to impose certain regulations , certain restrictions , certain proposals . 
283359:12	###We 've got to be pro-active about this , it 's no good simply sitting back and waiting for whatever government is in power , to impose certain regulations , certain restrictions , certain proposals . ###From being mainly voluntarily established we must see the development of new catalysed organisations meeting specific needs . 
283360:19	###From being mainly voluntarily established we must see the development of new catalysed organisations meeting specific needs . ###Statutory agencies will have to use a judicious mixture of grant and contract to help set up new organisations run by the community for the community , to create the range and choice required by consumers . 
283367:87	###The voluntary sector though , has a greater role to play now than ever before , both as advocate and service provider . ###They will need extensive support from N C V O and other groups , er , to be able to undertake that task . 
283373:11	###There is of course , an opportunity to use money currently locked up in large institutions and statutory organisations more productively through local effort . ###That is the challenge for local government . 
283375:50	###The current government must recognise that it cannot continue to go down the line of an individualist anxiety- ridden state , of competitive individuals where the poor and disabled are left to starve on city streets . ###On the other hand , Labour and other opposition parties , cannot just reassert the old statist notions about public funding of public production . 
283407:180	###There 's this tendency to suggest that there are these providers out there , that will provide . ###That health authorities and local authorities can simply tender and contract with the people there , and they 're not there . 
283408:140	###That health authorities and local authorities can simply tender and contract with the people there , and they 're not there . ###Or if they are there , they 're existing voluntary organisations which may be already very loaded , who 've got a lot of work to do , to get into a negotiating framework and so on , so the first the thing I 'd say in answer to you is that , N C V O and other must put a tremendous pressure on government and local authorities to fund the community development aspect of the pluralistic society which er , the current government seems to want . 
283475:60	###Erm , it 's been an important year for us , and I think that , you may recall that last year we talked a bit about the Nathan report , and er , if you look at the Directors er , report , you will see that quite a lot of the work that we talked about and was in the Nathan report , is now under way , and I think it 's very important . ###Er , our importance has er , frankly now been recognised by the Prime Minister , who talked about the voluntary organisations not very long ago and referred to us as cement , which holds society together , and I think if that 's right , and hopefully , the government may take a bit more notice of us . 
283496:14	###I can now ask er Geoffrey to second the motion , please . ###Good morning , erm , do I need to switch something on , oh , it 's working now . 
283497:49	###Good morning , erm , do I need to switch something on , oh , it 's working now . ###Good morning , I must say , I I stand before you today somewhat nervous , because erm , this is , this is my first to you as Treasurer , but this will be a slightly different speech from one 's that I have given in previous years . 
283498:7	###Good morning , I must say , I I stand before you today somewhat nervous , because erm , this is , this is my first to you as Treasurer , but this will be a slightly different speech from one 's that I have given in previous years . ###Treasurers suffer the erm , the occupational hazard that they always , to some extent , have to cry wolf . 
283499:7	###Treasurers suffer the erm , the occupational hazard that they always , to some extent , have to cry wolf . ###They have to advise caution in the use of finance . 
283503:7	###So in the past few years , I have given a speech which has has drawn attention to the the deficit on our General Fund and our need for continued care , to reduce the deficit . ###Erm , some years ago , the Executive Committee set us the target of reducing our deficit to nil , and reducing the deficit to nil by the year ninety-one , ninety-two . 
283525:8	###Two years ago , when the prospect of moving was first raised , erm , I was very firmly of the opinion that we should continue to rent our offices , because I did n't believe that erm , we were a property speculation company . ###I believe that we are the National Council for Voluntary Organisations , in a very different business . 
283577:12	###Er , I have pleasure in proposing resolution three , I think you have absolved me , Chairman , from reading out all the names . ###Of course , thank you very much . 
283648:108	###They cover our oral work , our advice services , our membership and affiliation services , and our publications . ###Now I am delighted to be able to hand over the spot-light to my three management colleagues on the management team . 
283662:52	###Many voluntary organisations including numbers of our members , many present here today , will be speaking forcefully in the interests of particular groups within society with which they work . ###But it undoubtedly does fall to N C V O and rightly so , to take the responsibility of representing the interests of the sector on a range of general issues . 
283662:80	###Many voluntary organisations including numbers of our members , many present here today , will be speaking forcefully in the interests of particular groups within society with which they work . ###But it undoubtedly does fall to N C V O and rightly so , to take the responsibility of representing the interests of the sector on a range of general issues . 
283664:65	###If N C V O is to be able to fulfil this purpose effectively , we must be working closely with our members , and we must have their confidence and respect , and such confidence , of course , is a two way process . ###N C V O needs to be sharing its knowledge , its information and general resources with its members , and also needs to ensure that its work is firmly grounded in the experience and knowledge of the plethora of voluntary organisations and charities , with which contact is maintained on a regular basis . 
283665:39	###N C V O needs to be sharing its knowledge , its information and general resources with its members , and also needs to ensure that its work is firmly grounded in the experience and knowledge of the plethora of voluntary organisations and charities , with which contact is maintained on a regular basis . ###Now it seems to me , that er , the watch-word for our policy development work over the next few years , must be effective co-ordination with our members and the wider voluntary sector . 
283668:15	###Other constituencies , of course , are important . ###Central Government , local authorities , the academic communities and so on , they are undoubtedly important , but they are subsidiary to the interest of the sector itself . 
283669:119	###Central Government , local authorities , the academic communities and so on , they are undoubtedly important , but they are subsidiary to the interest of the sector itself . ###N C V O must therefore , draw together voluntary organisations effectively and be seen to be responsive and creative . 
283689:33	###We will no doubt find , and again rightly so , that we have as much to learn from others , as to give . ###The Prime Minister 's recent speech at the Charities Aid Foundation Conference , indicates that the Government is going to make the encouragement of voluntary sector across the er , community and in encouragement of voluntary activity , a principle focus of the U K Presidency of the community from July next year . 
283694:111	###And only yesterday , at N C V O 's annual lobby conference on the implications of the Queen 's speech , we were talking with a number of our members about legislative priorities for the period , up to the forthcoming General Election , whenever that is . ###Finally , I ca n't finish without mentioning health and community care . 
283699:40	###We 're also very hopeful that we will have some extra support and assistance in this field at N C V O within the near future . ###Now these , of course , are just a few of the areas that the N C V O 's policy development work is intending to cover and will be concentrating on , in the year ahead . 
283701:38	###If we 're to do this work effectively , er , then it has to be in conjunction with you . ###Therefore I come back to where I started . 
283745:33	###This is reflected in in that of N C V O 's three strategic objectives , which relates to improving its own operational effectiveness , and enhancing recognition of its role . ###Making sure N C V O 's operation is fit for this task is a team of people who specialisms include , personnel , training , information and technology , communications , fund raising , finance , office management , and of course , the law . 
283836:161	###Thank you , Richard . ###Simon 
283913:66	###Sir Leonard . ###Well , thank you very much , Chair , for that splendid introduction , I 'm sure my mother would recognise me from er , what you said . 
283913:126	###Sir Leonard . ###Well , thank you very much , Chair , for that splendid introduction , I 'm sure my mother would recognise me from er , what you said . 
283927:45	###Erm , and I B M is is of course , very well known in the computer field . ###I B M , U K , which celebrates its fortieth anniversary this year , has some sixteen thousand employees based in some fifty two locations throughout the United Kingdom , and they 're working on all aspects of information technology , er , from software to silicon , from telecommunications to personal systems , and of course we form part of a very large company , I B M Corporation , which employs around three hundred and seventy thousand people across the world . 
284053:16	###That reminds me that it was Margaret Thatcher who said , Nobody would remember the Good Samaritan , if all he had was good intentions . ###He had money as well . 
284059:50	###Joint ownership of the future prosperity of the community and joint ownership of the future skills of the community . ###Ladies and gentlemen , it was a privilege to speak to you today . 
284063:84	###Thank you very much . ###Erm , I understand that you are willing to answer questions from the floor for a few minutes . 
284066:168	###Which is of course , the er , the professor and the chauffeur are , erm , on their way to the professor 's engagement . ###Like most professor 's , he only gives one lecture . 
284084:7	###No , San Sandra , make a note of that er , ###that bid will you . 
284095:25	###The leadership of B I C , involvement of the Prince of Wales , and indeed the involvement of the senior executives in their councils , I think has been very helpful . ###So er , kind words to us , thank you very much , but there are bodies which are working very effectively to spread the net , er , my view , by the way , is of course erm , I 'm a great believer in , er pressures being exercised by every mechanism . 
284095:65	###The leadership of B I C , involvement of the Prince of Wales , and indeed the involvement of the senior executives in their councils , I think has been very helpful . ###So er , kind words to us , thank you very much , but there are bodies which are working very effectively to spread the net , er , my view , by the way , is of course erm , I 'm a great believer in , er pressures being exercised by every mechanism . 
284097:10	###If you want er , the pressures have to be carefully thought out , er , and I think you have to be able to demonstrate that it is , it is self interest , and I think one continues to actually use these words . ###Not pure altruism , it is self interest , which , in fact , is your lever . 
284100:31	###You can exercise upwards pressure , er , no no organisation can stand alone . ###I think the government , and John by the way has been superb to us , in terms of being willing to come along , and help us do the work we 're doing , and I 'm , I believe the government has a great interest in this field . 
284129:31	###The other thing of course , is leave of absence , an and part-time work . ###We would actually guarantee that , jobs for numbers of years , so the people can actually take time off and then return , er , we also have arrangements to keep people in touch the business so , I 'm very proud of that record . 
284141:37	###We work in the Health arena , you yourself have had considerable experience , and you referred to the changing roles between public and private agencies , and you mentioned trusts and so on in the health arena , I just wondered whether you 'd like to explore with us a little , your own personal thinking about the nature of these changing roles , and perhaps a little bit of crystal ball gazing ahead , ###as to how you personally , we wo n't hold it against you , but how you personally might like to see that going . 
284160:128	###Well , you see , it 's easier for me to sit here , and to pontificate , and therefore your questions were well put , erm , we can demonstrate , I think a much more effective approach to the environment in in our field , because er , we 're dealing with chemicals which we have some control over , and which exists to some small degree in air , air machines . ###C F Cs , for example , er , we have just one a major prize , I 'm pleased to tell you , for eliminating C F Cs at our Greenock plant . 
284164:13	###Do n't you actually set up attention , and the answer of course , you do . ###Er , what companies can do , or should seek to do , is of course , see if they can manage round those tensions as well , but it takes a very long time to do that . 
284166:10	###So , I have to say , that er , I believe that companies which erm , find it easy to change , are of course , changing . ###Thank you very much , Sir Leonard . 
284169:10	###So thank you very much indeed , for coming , for addressing us , and we look forward I think both at national level and as you suggest , at local level with ever more valuable and productive relationships with the private sector , together with the other partners which , er , whom we need , and thank you for leading us along this ###Thank you , thank you for the opportunity . 
284180:103	###You do n't know anything about this , but Kay has been involved with N C V O for more than ten years , she joined the Executive Committee in nineteen eighty-one , I 'm reliably informed , just before I got involved . ###I forget . 
284189:52	###I 'm now , I 'm not retiring , I 'm just going back to being part of a member from my Hampshire Council of Community Service , and I shall be writing , of course , very rude letter , if the services and the communications of letters do n't come up to standards . ###But thank you all , and I wish you you the members and N C V O itself , every good fortune , and I think we 've had such a good day today , and I think Sir Leonard has shown us a really very clear way forward , and I know that the relationships which already exist , and those which will be developed can only be Thank you all very much for your support and help through those years . 
284276:85	###Right , now you you 've already made it clear to us that about half the increase in development costs are due to increases in the costs of the equipment . ###The that is so erm how much in total and or proportionally was due to equipments themselves being more expensive than expected and how much because the U K share of costs was higher . 
284286:41	###I I do n't wish to , to quibble but is actually a cost minus basis industry is not being paid its full costs for this programme , they 've been paid a percentage less than the cost they actually incur . ###Depending upon the master . 
284312:143	###Well er I think as I mentioned at the outset , there 's no fundamental technical problem er a system operating broadly in the same way er was designed an an and proved on the United Kingdom 's experimental aircraft programme er six or seven years ago , er this particular aircraft , the airfighter two thousand , will employ a rather more er extensive capability in its flight control system . ###It 's not to interface with more systems , there 's a lot more software in it and er therefore the companies concerned have got a lot more work to do . 
284316:141	###All of those things have led to lead to this kind of delay . ###Let 's go to hardware problems , one or two , what were they ? 
284347:48	###Correct . ###Why , when G E C had all the expertise to do this and Deutsch Aerospace frankly , does not have a great deal of background in this . 
284424:163	###the third wing . ###Well yes er , we had n't thought of that one Mr but maybe we should do that . 
284429:217	###Yeah , that er little anecdote I I 've heard mentioned previously , er the the ray dome erm is erm er currently in the course of development and of course the the four nations each wish to participate in this interesting piece of technology . ###So the consortium that was doing the development arranged the work between themselves in a way which they themselves considered to be efficient . 
284453:106	###Er , so the lesson we learned from tornado was that we want to try and cap our financial liabilities for the project for the development of it , at a much earlier stage and er drive as tough a commercial bargain as we possibly can . ###So we embarked on a different commercial strategy , trying to implement that that lesson . 
284455:21	###It has had considerable benefits , it 's had one or two drawbacks and er I think the biggest lesson that we have probably learned so far from the Eurofighter programme , is that we have to be very careful when we make work sharing agreements in future , that er we do n't try to drive the work sharing requirement down to too low a level . ###If we can keep it in broad percentage terms of the total work at the project level , fine , that can be done , efficiently and effectively . 
284598:105	###That is absolutely right , correct . ###Bruce George . 
284620:97	###So for example , in the specialist air defence er side we 're looking at alternatives would be the F twenty two erm the current tornado F three and also an upgraded variant of the F three . ###In the ground attack side we 're comparing it to the jaguar that it 'll replace , the harrier G R seven and also the tornado G R four and then in the multi-role arena for air defence , air superiority and attack we 're comparing our aircraft against the French Raphall the American F eighteen E which is the the future variant of the F eighteen , the F fifteen E , the multi-role but primarily air to surface machine and also the F sixteen C. Those are the ones we 're currently looking at . 
284706:104	###But certainly we er as I said , the essential point is that we are looking , looking at the capability across the board and taking into account the strategic requirement as we see it in terms of the direct threat to the U K in particular , which is obviously dramatically declined as a result of the collapse of the Warsaw pact . ###We believe that certainly for the time being , the combination of the fighter aircraft and rapier will provide an acceptable level er of air defence with a much reduced air threat to the U K er which now exists . 
284748:33	###So we are convinced that it is er a cheap one . ###What about spare aircraft . 
284752:37	###Thank you , Mr Colgan . ###Mr erm bearing in mind it its multi role capability and the fact that the U K is likely to be engaged in more and more out of air operations in support of U N er has any consideration been given to a maritime variant . 
284775:122	###Er I do n't think I 'd wish to speculate in in open forum . ###It does n't require a great bite of imagination to see that the Germans for example would have been extremely reluctant to have been involved in a four nation project with a nuclear capability available as part of it . 
284782:260	###Is that right ? ###I think as a Group Captain er explained y' know the the operational staff have really got to complete their study into what kind of tactical reconnaissance capability they want in the next century . 
284791:18	###I think it was three years earlier though was n't it ? ###like the jaguar really be able to go on that long given er that er there 's an awful lot of errors in the Gulf apart from anything else . 
284998:50	###debts of some four hundred thousand million pounds , trust law does fall down . ###The only recompe the only resource anyone has is to go to the courts , for the courts to decide what the law is at that present moment . 
284998:93	###debts of some four hundred thousand million pounds , trust law does fall down . ###The only recompe the only resource anyone has is to go to the courts , for the courts to decide what the law is at that present moment . 
284999:98	###The only recompe the only resource anyone has is to go to the courts , for the courts to decide what the law is at that present moment . ###Now that 's a costly business as we know to our cost , we did n't have to pay the three hundred thousand pounds , the pension fund did , but we had to risk paying those to go to court . 
285000:129	###Now that 's a costly business as we know to our cost , we did n't have to pay the three hundred thousand pounds , the pension fund did , but we had to risk paying those to go to court . ###Now next year something else might happen and somebody may be forced to go to court , if they cannot go to court they cannot get justice and they have to wait to see what happens . 
285002:41	###Now we have in the Companies Act a Table A which gives you a suggested er model , Memorandum of Association and Articles Association , why not a dedicated pensions act which says in here these are the minimum terms you must contain in your Trust Deed . ###You can better them if you wish , but you cannot go below them . 
285003:149	###You can better them if you wish , but you cannot go below them . ###People would know exactly where they stood then and we would n't have to go keep going to the courts to develop the theory of Trust Law . 
285040:41	###Right , well I think the biggest problem with Trust Law is that it expects too much of trustees . ###It starts off essentially defining them as people who are impartial , and in no time at all we are talking about them being nominated from different sector interest . 
285058:25	###Directly directly B T started erm saying well thirty thousand employees will go this year under B T ninety-two scheme i.e. they will go at fifty , they will draw their pension at fifty , which is n't the trust deed and for many years Inland Revenue point blank refused to let anybody draw a pension below sixty . ###They changed that , so the money er it 's a bit different than the Maxwell , the money has n't been erm a switched over to the Cayman Islands and all over the place , it 's it 's stayed in , in the but of course we 're told by the trustees and by our legal advice that nothing illegal 's taken place , the money 's been used to st er finance early voluntary retirement etcetera , etcetera . 
285058:64	###Directly directly B T started erm saying well thirty thousand employees will go this year under B T ninety-two scheme i.e. they will go at fifty , they will draw their pension at fifty , which is n't the trust deed and for many years Inland Revenue point blank refused to let anybody draw a pension below sixty . ###They changed that , so the money er it 's a bit different than the Maxwell , the money has n't been erm a switched over to the Cayman Islands and all over the place , it 's it 's stayed in , in the but of course we 're told by the trustees and by our legal advice that nothing illegal 's taken place , the money 's been used to st er finance early voluntary retirement etcetera , etcetera . 
285139:22	###There are still British Steel pensioners from the old scheme who genuinely do not know that there exists a new scheme . ###Do you not believe that with this recommendation where 
285174:15	###And we 're also saying that if you have a new pensions act , the work of the regulator would be much easier . ###Why ? 
285309:78	###On the seventh of June I got my statutory twelve months . ###Yeah . 
285340:29	###Think of Colin and his predicament . ###Also it may be a godsend to you because as soon as you drive that car becomes yours . 
285361:149	###Right . ###Erm do they involve you travelling out there on a regular basis ? 
285362:16	###Erm do they involve you travelling out there on a regular basis ? ###Well on the Wittering job he said he wanted somebody there you know er myself as manager to oversee the job but on the Sheffield Wednesday job , incidentally I 'd I got the contract from them both , the Sheffield Wednesday job was done I 'd only ever had to visit it once and that was at my request not at anybody else 's and either way both erm the Wittering and the Sheffield Wednesday er there have been other drivers going . 
285401:83	###Yeah . ###Was there a pension scheme ? 
285428:38	###Yeah saying that they 're entitled to dismiss you without notice . ###We are going to give you one week 's pay in respect of each couple of years of servi , years ' service . 
285429:7	###We are going to give you one week 's pay in respect of each couple of years of servi , years ' service . ###If they 've made you redundant that 's what they have to do . 
285433:114	###So they 're saying this is an ex gratia payment in other words they 're offering you that payment as er some compensation for the fact that you 've losing your job . ###But it says here should a tribunal require them to pay a basic award for compensation then that payment is on the basis that it 's offered and accepted in satisfaction er towards those payments . 
285438:40	###towards these yeah it 's not full and final settlement it 's towards these payments . ###I do n't understand this bit to pay a basic award of compensation following an order . 
285461:11	###Right . ###Not even as f far as getting him to work in the morning . 
285549:50	###Legal aid is not available in any form for industrial tribunal hearings erm so what I usually say is that we assist the client up to the stage where s it means going er to the tribunal itself . ###Yeah . 
285557:29	###I ca n't do it today . ###Mm . 
285644:7	###Mm . ###And then again if they pay me this money as an ex gratia payment . 
285682:163	###Okay just so I can assess whether I can give you reduced cost advice under the legal aid system , are you working at all at the moment ? ###Do you receive income support ? 
285682:186	###Okay just so I can assess whether I can give you reduced cost advice under the legal aid system , are you working at all at the moment ? ###Do you receive income support ? 
285716:30	###Yeah . ###What happened to him , do you know ? 
285746:7	###Okay this is erm an application for full legal aid so that we can deal with an application for residence . ###Can you just sign that for me down the bottom there ? 
285774:34	###Well I was advised to do this because m my Dad 's a policeman ###Yeah . 
285960:25	###Er yes if you would n't mind . ###Okay then . 
286090:15	###and I have just done some work for Derbyshire and they have deducted twe tax at twenty five per cent and for my invoice . ###Erm and the difficulty is proving to some of the L E As that you 're actually self-employed . 
286168:13	###He he he actually suggested that I might like to call and see him this afternoon but I was n't available for that so well ###Yes , yes . 
286201:39	###the outcome I mean it 's very rare that we do get a refusal . ###Yes . 
286290:20	###It 's a it 's a rather a debatable thing as to who is actually your employer . ###That 's right . 
286294:32	###Right . ###Fine . 
286320:8	###You know when I wro ###It 's two in surnames and one in christian names I always think . 
286412:7	###In the bank manager 's own handwriting . ###Ah mm . 
286418:14	###eight pounds ###Yes . 
286555:5	###Yeah . ###to sort of three months and you 
286568:15	###Yeah , yeah . ###And it 's been less than it 's between six weeks and five months has it ? 
286572:7	###Right so that 's six to twelve months . ###That 's six to twelve months was n't it yes . 
286573:7	###That 's six to twelve months was n't it yes . ###I must get my glasses changed . 
286647:4	###I I think business ###Yeah . 
286788:55	###Yeah . ###normally that erm 
286793:77	###But most of the people who come here for interviews goes to Lincoln ###Yeah , yeah . 
286858:12	###I mean we did have ###Yes . 
286881:13	###and erm the they di did pass him but ###Oh . 
286888:10	###Right . ###was you know factual within the in the written part . 
286896:13	###Yes so i i at one time to get onto the to apply for the Enterprise ###Mm . 
286912:47	###then in a position ###Yes . 
286995:7	###I think you can get bogged down in in the button pushing and making mistakes . ###Yes , yes yes yes . 
287003:14	###Yes . ###unless you 're doing it . 
287296:17	###Right let 's have a look . ###And it 's got to be one of those whites . 
287365:7	###It 's a great game is n't it ? ###Half built houses . 
287444:10	###Oh I see ###otherwise it 's not going to hang 
287761:63	###Right . ###Mhm . 
288082:21	###the clearance when the door is open to the the piece of wall there is only that much . ###Oh I see . 
288143:9	###And fitter . ###Right . 
288179:7	###White . ###White . 
288238:10	###if you hold them up to the light then you see them ###Yes and then you see through That one 's got a 
288408:26	###Yeah . ###your blind as well 
288469:13	###The way the sun comes . ###Which end do you want to have the controls ? 
288598:66	###I 've just well and truly broken mine , you know I chipped the end of the ###Yeah . 
288776:31	###Then then then the winner of course is the one that takes the money . ###Erm now that sounds to me to be the best way of doing . 
289117:10	###Could probably only five hundred . ###How how are we off for for pens ? 
289120:10	###Cheap pens . ###order some more . 
289201:7	###six and seventh of May it is ###Six and seventh of May , Yeah six and seventh of May , that 's right . 
289401:43	###Yeah . ###Situations . 
289714:7	###And a chap , lad this year 's got not quite the same but very very good A level results . ###Please . 
289716:9	###You must think I 'm absolutely barking just to have been sat with this in front of me and not done anything about it . ###Thank you . 
289791:17	###That 's very nice . ###Good initiative . 
289881:16	###That was going to be in May so we needed it to ship in April so I said , well you 've got to you 've got to still finish it at the same time . ###And then Australia came back and said , no that wo n't be soon enough , you 've got to ship it I ca n't remember when it was , beginning of March . 
289920:7	###Which was a very good thing most of the the young apprentices would never know about slip rings . ###Yeah . 
289950:22	###Yeah . ###Yeah . 
289958:25	###That 's right , it was on a twelve twelve volt erm wiper motor . ###Mhm . 
290069:25	###So consequently our guys ran circles round them ###Marvellous . 
290069:54	###So consequently our guys ran circles round them ###Marvellous . 
290070:12	###Marvellous . ###and we balance it out that we had to built the caravan , the deadline we had to tow it across there in back end of March . 
290171:9	###Yeah . ###Increase . 
290609:9	###Yeah . ###Yeah . 
290683:102	###worried about this one . ###I put that price up more than the standard , that 's wrong . 
290700:90	###Er . ###Right , , P O A . 
290705:7	###And er we 'll have a a summary of what have got net lists and what have n't . ###And then you say whether yes or no . 
290751:49	###It would be a negative margin would n't it . ###Yeah . 
291214:25	###Well you better price them accordingly . ###Right okay . 
291285:55	###Yeah . ###I think now 's the time . 
291361:7	###Think of one . ###Well er . 
291387:12	###This is it I do n't know how they do it . ###It 's only dimensional tolerances do n't forget . 
291390:81	###Well according to the the P Thanks Carol , the the the P five specs no does n't involve noise testing . ###No it 's purely dimensional . 
291562:45	###No , you ca n't do it , you know , there 's there 's ###Sensible answer . 
291593:13	###Erm , how would we do it then ? ###Let 's say we 've got three pizzas , and we share them out between twelve people , how would you do that ? 
291841:156	###at all and it 's it messes everything ###Yeah . 
291988:56	###if it was seventeen per cent , oh I can do that it 's point one seven , but when it 's seventeen point five , and where does the point go ? ###I 've got two 
292101:24	###Right . ###We can always put noughts on the end of , after the decimal place , . 
292101:140	###Right . ###We can always put noughts on the end of , after the decimal place , . 
292181:9	###The VAT is that you ###Yeah . 
292217:31	###Me friend over in Norway , she said she 's she got over there and sat down and she thought , yes , she 's got the Complete Works of Shakespeare , I 'll have a whale of a time trying to read it , she picks up the book , it 's all in Norwegian . ###Oh no . 
292228:124	###Yeah , . ###Scouse . 
292250:27	###Yeah , well she said , it 's hard you see , cos when they go , she goes out , erm , to a place called Frognapark and they have no public toilets , ###Right . 
292250:55	###Yeah , well she said , it 's hard you see , cos when they go , she goes out , erm , to a place called Frognapark and they have no public toilets , ###Right . 
292308:10	###So that 's where you are , give me the one out . ###Always draw that line in for North , I 've just used the red line there . 
292328:76	###okay , there 's all sorts of them , I mean you can have it the wrong nought , ###Yeah . 
292333:17	###Okay . ###Is that actually a forty five there ? that was that was a forty five , near enough , now , how did you work that out ? 
292334:43	###Is that actually a forty five there ? that was that was a forty five , near enough , now , how did you work that out ? ###Because the first thing you have to do is what ? 
292337:8	###Draw the line North . ###Right . 
292428:5	###What they do , I mean just play a game , it 's just a ga it 's a it 's a game , like sort of Simon says , try and catch them out in things , you 'll say right , now you 've got to point at a window , say , and then you have to point at , and you can get them all doing it , you ###Yeah . 
292429:28	###Yeah . ###have to point out , Joe , and they all go now , okay , now a new game . 
292431:8	###You point at the window , but you must all turn round that way , turn round to your right so you 're going round , then clockwise they probably would n't understand , but ###Yeah . 
292431:51	###You point at the window , but you must all turn round that way , turn round to your right so you 're going round , then clockwise they probably would n't understand , but ###Yeah . 
292584:66	###That 's it . ###And this is a very common question . 
292617:153	###And forty five degrees is one , try it , try it , do that one again with forty degrees . ###Right . 
292696:40	###I promise , but not at the moment cos it needs a lot of setting up , I 'll get myself to set my computer up specially to make those disks ###Yeah . 
292700:80	###stuff , erm , I 'll I 've got a disk that does interesting little joined up lines , and there 's one where you can just put numbers in yourself and it 'll draw all sorts of pictures for you ###Oh , yeah . 
292933:44	###So good ways of checking that you got it right , and then you can go on comfortably with , let 's have a look at erm this time you 're buying a block of gold , er ###As you do , yeah . 
293016:17	###All the other networks we see , I think the networks we 've seen not many of them are slow in learning . ###And they 're slow in learning because they optimize er using this learning rule . 
293024:85	###One of the reasons for its speed comes from that . ###So we 've got some examples here of some patterns that we want to learn using the N tuple method and tuple and tuple . 
293058:18	###So what we can what it effectively does is count sort of sub-patterns within the whole pattern and how well we 're recognizing those . ###It 's rather like what we talked about right at the beginning we talked about picking out features from our image such as the the width the height er the grey area or whatever of the image . 
293064:15	###One here one in the middle one at the bottom . ###The important thing is that they 're very arbitrary . 
293065:55	###The important thing is that they 're very arbitrary . ###You you do n't have to know anything about the problem to specify them . 
293085:35	###And of course the whole thing is very easy to compute . ###Really after the N tuple method was defined in nineteen fifty nine erm the next person who came along that did anything with it was Igor Alexander supervisor that 's why I work on this area . 
293094:31	###We then have binary decoders . ###And as you know binary decoders list all the possible states of the input erm conditions . 
293132:12	###The only small idea that I have and I do n't think it 's particularly practical is for a sort of oscilloscope triggering mechanism often , which is in fact one you get in logic analysers anyway . ###But er often you might want to trigger off a particular pattern coming on the trace . 
293132:21	###The only small idea that I have and I do n't think it 's particularly practical is for a sort of oscilloscope triggering mechanism often , which is in fact one you get in logic analysers anyway . ###But er often you might want to trigger off a particular pattern coming on the trace . 
293133:37	###But er often you might want to trigger off a particular pattern coming on the trace . ###And you might have to you have to do that in in the order of nanoseconds . 
293160:21	###How can can it always solve the problem ? ###Well it ca n't it does n't always solve the problem . 
293173:90	###So it 's either setting or not setting the weights and in the N tuple rule all we do is in fact set the weights . ###So we present the pattern . 
293186:31	###But what we 've effectively got is a neuron here a neuron here and a neuron here and we 've got our three classes . ###And we pre-process the data as I say commonly for all the neurons before we present it to our three neurons . 
293189:7	###Well as you see we can count the number of terms that actually match from our training sets . ###So this example here we might find that that matches that matches we get a response of two from here and we get a response less than the response from here and the same response from this . 
293212:33	###First of all that the input can be grey scale of course instead of binary . ###So how does the system cope with that . 
293212:48	###First of all that the input can be grey scale of course instead of binary . ###So how does the system cope with that . 
293253:20	###For each the example pattern you compute er this input tuple vector . ###So we take our example we put it through these decoders . 
293254:7	###So we take our example we put it through these decoders . ###Before we do this we have to apply a mapping function M. The mapping function is important because as I say these wires are connected to these pixels here . 
293301:19	###I mean the basic mechanism is very simple as I say . ###First thing we want to have a look at is how it generalizes . 
293363:7	###Erm unfortunately the advertising standards did n't uphold uphold the complaint but at least we made a point . ###Tasks to carry forward to the next meeting . 
293382:23	###the secretary 's minutes . ###Ha you have n't seen the spelling . 
293383:50	###Ha you have n't seen the spelling . ###Coordinator 's report please before we have to spell check the minutes . 
293494:49	###I think that 's the only way to proceed to to sort out this tangle once and for all . ###Yeah . 
293498:10	###The system 's fixed so . ###Yeah . 
293521:20	###Helen ? ###Erm I think technically we 're actually constitutional because it does n't say anything in the constitution about us having to publish the deadline . 
293537:57	###Yeah . ###Right on the newsletter front the other thing is the next newsletter we said would go in the post by the seventh of February . 
293558:32	###I think also if we could have some sort of timings when people could turn up . ###Yes sure . 
293574:29	###Yeah I 'll let you know . ###I think there might be a I 've got one announcement you can put from that . 
293623:15	###Whether there 's any truth in this is and the A A E who did the er survey include Atomic Energy Authority who who 's like that as well . ###Right okay . 
293624:7	###Right okay . ###I think we must have missed a briefing from 
293659:14	###slot more people in appropriate . ###Erm two single bedrooms and two double bedrooms plus a living room all facilities erm except for sheets and towels . 
293695:51	###The the extra advantage of the of the house would be cooking which we may get . ###Because if if people took advantage of the of these facilities it would make the whole business an awful lot cheaper for them . 
293726:25	###Two single and two double . ###Yeah well on a first come first serve basis a single room I 'd come in on it . 
293749:25	###Mm . ###for a night or two to have somewhere that they know they can at least kip on the floor . 
293777:47	###Okay . ###I 'll make a decision when I 'm in a position to . 
293778:9	###I 'll make a decision when I 'm in a position to . ###Well this is why it would be a good idea to so people will have to decide in advance and just see how we go for 
293781:51	###I 'll find out when I ring and she 'll . ###If I do I 'll be ringing round frantically find out what to do . 
293795:9	###No I wo n't be er my family situation can change so . ###Oh . 
293897:54	###Yeah . ###So he 's Secretary of State . 
293924:16	###And if that happened the bill automatically falls unless we can move the closure of the debate . ###Now this means that the sponsor of the bill , Allan , brothers , pro proposes that the debate be closed and the bill be given a second reading . 
293924:38	###And if that happened the bill automatically falls unless we can move the closure of the debate . ###Now this means that the sponsor of the bill , Allan , brothers , pro proposes that the debate be closed and the bill be given a second reading . 
293927:22	###With me so far ? ###Mm . 
293927:35	###With me so far ? ###Mm . 
293927:54	###With me so far ? ###Mm . 
293931:7	###It is no good putting a closure vote by ninety nine to one or even ninety nine to nought . ###The objector cunningly does n't vote . 
293967:45	###There are more Ministers of State that there are Secretaries of State . ###Yeah . 
293988:43	###Unpaid . ###So 
293988:67	###Unpaid . ###So 
294046:55	###Yeah . ###With a bit of luck and careful handling . 
294130:37	###Is this your understand as well as the cost of the poster ? ###I think so . 
294143:7	###Doing this this is one erm campaign that as a small proportion of the poster sites is it ? ###It looks that way yeah . 
294144:17	###It looks that way yeah . ###There must be lots of other . 
294144:44	###It looks that way yeah . ###There must be lots of other . 
294151:20	###But I 'll write her a postcard to say , Yes it looks quite interesting when can we see the samples and can you tell us more about how the money works . ###Yeah and confirm that that is n't a daily price . 
294236:7	###I do n't know what I 'm doing . ###The general 
294244:57	###Okay ###Still I suppose the time 's it 's the actual the calendar 's starting to tick for having this is n't it now . 
294270:10	###Yeah . ###Oh might as well then . 
294275:17	###I mean I think if you 're not sure whether you want whether you 'll be able to go I mean you can still you can still be a delegate then if you do go then you 're able to vote so . ###So you 'd like to be put down on the ballot to be approved do you ? 
294285:42	###Oh it 's nice to see people to see a good list of people who are going . ###And I could put myself down as in case I get there for a day or two . 
294293:26	###Erm John said he informed me he he 'd stand for Monk again and he I told him to write write a . ###John ' s Monk . 
294298:17	###But we do n't ###wards . 
294379:23	###I was still laughing too much from from some comment that the Government did one one of their four promises was to was to put pri public transport before private roads . ###I nearly cracked up . 
294603:13	###Er , are , exceptions . ###Right , well I did n't expect it to take that long to the apostrophe . 
294636:12	###So , the fact that who works in the green grocers is just a bit of additional information , it 's not necessary for the the main part of the sentence , you can take it out and it 's not going to take , make any difference to the construction or the meaning of the sentence , it 's a bit of additional information . ###Or , you will need comma , amongst other things comma , three bricks and a length of rope . 
294652:13	###really there 's one after night , but you do n't need after , one after tired , just carry straight on . ###But it 's a normal 
294738:14	###Is it the colon . ###You could use the semicolon . 
294806:7	###Chairman I 'll try and be brief er I think the problem with the car boot sales is that they have been er hi-jacked commercially er it seems a good idea it 's , it 's another line another way of disposing of goods whether they 're straight goods or whether they 're they 're er misappropriated goods or whatever . ###Er and I think that er that 's part of the problem that we have . 
294811:20	###Now what happens when you go to the station on a Sunday to park your car and find all the spaces are taken up by a car boot , er the whole think is a nonsense and er frankly somebody should tell British Rail so er I wonder if this is Chairman a shot across the bows of er rail privat privatisation and if it is I welcome it . ###Erm 
294824:142	###I mean it 's it 's happened and I was ha I was so interested in the subject that I asked Mr for a copy of the report where it goes back in the history and of course it is the history of trading standards and , and so on . ###Nevertheless there ought to be some control somewhere and we 're getting back to what I think Richard said was the original idea of some kind of development control that is a popular thing in order to be allowed , people ought to make money for the various charities and so on , we ought to try and prevent er certain unjust practices going on and so on . 
294829:17	###Thank you Mr Chairman , I , I 've got a certain amount of experience in the subject because we got quite a big one in our village . ###In actual fact the er farmer put the planning application in to hold this market every week really refused it outright saying it 's a very sensitive area of Green belt and we did n't want two hundred er stalls there every Sunday on the car park coming out of the road and everything else .

294863:56	###I wonder if the Chief Fire Officer can er add anything further on that . ###Yes sir , the , you 'll recall that carrying out this re this particular review to finalise the er fire safety review and members have accepted the recommendations from that in which sought to ignore that although we have an limited number of specialists inspecting officers that we widened the remit of all employees in the Fire and Rescue Service so that all er operational fire fighters carried out some form of inspection , thereby producing a higher work output than before . 
294887:225	###implementing the recommendations made in the report that you have before you and er we we would like to see a report back which we will do anyway erm after the Inspector has visited and discussed it . ###But Chairman if I may 
294900:125	###Do n't read too much into it , it 's all innocent stuff of course . ###Thank you Simon Mrs . 
294900:196	###Do n't read too much into it , it 's all innocent stuff of course . ###Thank you Simon Mrs . 
294936:7	###Erm there is er a danger that we as a County Council might become er embroiled in doing erm er work concerning the possible ###which of course is rightly the , the domain of the District Council so I hope we wo n't get too involved in that . 
294976:84	###erm could actually do , so what we are saying here is it needs to be considered seriously in answer so you know we hope the Liberal Democrats will perhaps come in and support us on this or perhaps amend their motion and send this via the panel . ###Thank you Mr er Mr 
294989:117	###The other side of the coin is the one that 's , that 's a , a , a that 's , that 's mentioned by Michael and that is the improvement in the proportion of the waste sch sch stream that can be recycled . ###I would hope that whatever the County would put in place would encourage the w the , the waste collection authorities currently the district er councils actually to offer at doorstep collection arrangements wo which I believe will substantially increase the amount of , of waste that could be recycled . 
294992:7	###It , it , it , it , it 's , it , it surprises me that the amount of waste er that the proportion of , of the waste is , is , is fifty percent being er , er , er being builders ' rubble not to put too fine a point on it . ###Erm and I am also conscious of , of the amount of , of , of commercial er , er commercial er tipping and that , that , that , that , that goes on . 
295072:47	###It is a disturbing thing and Brian in this short amendment drew attention to the high levels of unemployment . ###There are people not working , there are people who have been trained , there are people who have worked and have been trained . 
295143:258	###There is a need for a commuter airport to serve London . ###Er the communications from Hatfield , Hertford are first class into the centre of London er is an option that perhaps you can consider but the fact that we can also then look at the Sunderland example . 
295155:88	###Chairman before we . ###Er er Mr . 
295170:22	###has been a magnificent response er something er something approaching two thousand have been received . ###Last night very late I was told that 
295185:7	###I happen to know it but I think it would be wrong of me to disclose it tonight er this evening . ###I think you should wait for that and do n't make any presumptions about the future of the runway . 
295203:35	###Their jobs would be completely lost for Hertfordshire , you ca n't commute from Hatfield to Stansted and those people Hatfield ###and working in Hatfield they will not be able to go to Stansted it , it , it all would finally 
295325:59	###I want some explanation Chairman . ###challenged , one 
295332:283	###Mrs could you start us now ? ###Well I would speak on the way that resolution number one er that 's the report we brought back to the committee about timing and implementation . 
295369:63	###Chairman er ca n't really use that refers directly to the Council . ###Now whether you actually wish this to go to the court Council I do n't know . 
295441:32	###Thank you Chairman . ###This report is , is about further consultation of and for restriction on provided by this society . 
295478:19	###It is hard to escape the conclusion that the Department of Transport 's totally incompetent and has no concept whatsoever of the possible implications of its decisions . ###Stansted is by the Government to be a major airport of the future and you would therefore assume that the Government would be planning that development but it is now clear that Stansteds future is based on unknown or undisclosed information of genius arithmetic and a desire to listen only to the aviation industry . 
295481:7	###If it is the case that the present proposals from like the earlier and are within the law then it is only who the law is inadequate . ###It is clearly wrong that the Government to make decisions based on such poor informations , such poor consultation . 
295482:9	###It is clearly wrong that the Government to make decisions based on such poor informations , such poor consultation . ###We must however 
295503:77	###Erm I have said all erm conservation processes have been out it is know as a sham , because they have their numbers quite determing of course what this intention er that proper consultation so this time round . ###I mean that 's how we get a how much 
295531:35	###And also there is the issue of where the response er decision which you may have Heathrow terminal five , will in fact , in any future er discussions about er the further developments of Stansted Airport . ###Erm and that is one of the issues which I think we would need to comment on er at the last enquiry as the airport . 
295564:8	###This is a shame because half of the U K passengers arriving at Heathrow do n't actually live in South East England . ###They do n't want to go to South East England . 
295583:80	###Er for the Conservative group er we agreed with our colleagues from the other side er the need to install by very close integration on public transport with anything that goes on at Heathrow er I was ###concerned the other day that the government had second thoughts on some of the proposals there and I hope that they will reconsider . 
295609:47	###capacity at Luton to buy themselves three years extra planning time and therefore very concerned that there should be no undue delay in the er authorities coming to the appropriate decisions on the planning . ###Thank you Mr Mr . 
295622:13	###We tend to see it from perhaps sort of Heathrow that you want to go in , into London because that 's where , where the links are , by roads an and then the part of the link we 've got is at Piccadilly line . ###Erm would like transport , you could skip off , you could actually go to anywhere within Holland , er through , by road , that you can go by public transport and go by train and you can go by bus to virtually anywhere in the country .

295644:9	###Terminal five on its own is complete madness , to say we 're just gonna put it there and forget about everything else would be absolute crass stupidity . ###Er we never expected from the Department of Transport and any minute book . 
295648:109	###The fact remains ###that unclear 
295649:38	###that unclear ###whether it 's a large economic growth in Europe in places like Milan , Innsbruck er Barcelona , all have these systems where an extra terminal capacity is only part of the jigsaw that 's had to be met . 
295651:58	###Now it may in our statement of case , and it must say that the points that er , er , it 's not the shopping list that you put down there , the cross rail link is vitally important to the economy and money . ###The Kings Collins Cross terminal as it says here the Kings Cross er terminal for the cross channel route is also of vital importance and in fact it could be that with the development of a high speed , the high speed train services between not only London but also the North of England into the European local structure , that the need for 
295658:103	###Another point to make a is that on no account should terminal five be used as an excuse for a third runway . ###Now I know said I was but I give the impression from that if you shake hands with them you should count your fingers afterwards 
295687:48	###We are all the time , every time we encourage extra journeys we are encouraging extra C O 2 emissions the most part is found most important factors in increasing the security generation and all other forms of airborne pollution . ###And we 're not considering any of it . 
295714:82	###Now the point is that , that , that is not as a result of the possibility of extending er terminal five . ###That is n't as in predicted number of additional car journeys or people wishing to go to Heathrow , so what is actually suggested by the Liberals is that the those additional people are going to arrive and be serviced by terminals which are out of date and they wo n't actually have the facilities th that are required . 
295715:26	###That is n't as in predicted number of additional car journeys or people wishing to go to Heathrow , so what is actually suggested by the Liberals is that the those additional people are going to arrive and be serviced by terminals which are out of date and they wo n't actually have the facilities th that are required . ###You cannot talk about regeneration of of an economy or or s sustained economy , er it is one added to agenda and we will have to prepare to let the economy just over the border at Heathrow fade away and give it to another country . 
295737:15	###ten , eleven , twelve , thirteen , fourteen , fifteen , sixteen , seventeen , eighteen . ###well we get two votes because you 're the goodies . 
295787:7	###It is the concern of the people in Hertfordshire following the woods only about three miles away , they now and many Hertfordshire residents , I 'm sure lots of people in this room use voluntary commission land where their , their on holiday . ###If this land comes into private ownership , it is very doubtful and dim the same amount of access and the same amount of conservation will be , er private conservation will be given and we wo n't have the control over it we have now . 
295847:14	###If they were the sort of people that were frightened to go out , up to the newspaper shop or something like that , our penalties and our , our priorities would be slightly different . ###And my plea is , apart from all the politics that 's going on , and all your wrong and I 'm right , etc , etc , etc , if we 've got sixty-odd police constables available , then , somehow or other we ought to try and find the money to resource them . 
295872:127	###It makes a change that the burden of more want is put on the central government instead of local authorities , because too often in the past , central government has said , in many issues , oh , we think you should have that , but the responsibility for paying for it comes from the local authority . ###But we 're not going to give you any more money . 
295896:58	###But I 've left that sort of civil liberty out of this motion today , because we ca n't deal with all the , because we ca n't deal with everything all at once , but perhaps it can be tou touched at council , because we had Colonel , who also does n't like to be confused with the facts , trying to tell us that next year the , or the year after next , budgets will be cash limited , but I 've got news , they already are cash limited . ###Now reference was made to the police finance working party which met for a long period of time , and unfortunately made no progress whatsoever in zero base budgeting . 
295899:265	###Now Mr referred to a two percent clear up rate , I 'm not quite certain what figure that is , I know in Wiltshire it 's much better than that in the thirties and forties . ###But nationally the clear up rate has fallen under the Conservatives from forty-one percent to twenty six percent , and there is no excuse at all for a freeze on the number of police officers when we were promised an extra thousand . 
295938:115	###I wish to move an amendment which is erm , that we defer any decision on this until the property , the director of property services has made his report to the property sub- committee on the erm , future , stroke to the organisation , which is th , the subject of his next report to property sub- committee . ###Seconded . 
296022:90	###Erm I hope two sentences , thank you Mr Chairman . ###One is , is really , I felt I should reply in support of Mr concerning some of Mr ' s remarks . 
296115:49	###Mr will be able to sleep silently in his bed . ###Yes , the problem was , with the previous suggestion of Chief Public Protection Officer , director , appeared to have confused with the responsibilities of the Chief Fire Officer , but if we say County Public Protection Officer . 
296150:51	###But , there was concern about the title of the director of public protection . ###To answer the question of Mrs , I have spoken to Mr , he is Mr , and he has already explained , would like a short title , and would like to keep away from the previous department 's tasks of trading standards and public health for obvious reasons . 
296152:4	###Erm , if members do n't like the word consumer then I think they would have to use public , er it does cover , I I think the title County Public Protection Officer would er , er satisfy Mr and I do n't think it would upset the Chief Fire Officer . ###Right , those in fav any more speakers 
296180:67	###You do n't sell a house and keep the mortgage , we have debts . ###We have probably less debts maybe than some of the other authorities in Wiltshire , and Thamesdown has a far greater debt than ours . 
296182:72	###But it is only right , it 's public money , that if we are owing money , that we should have to use some of the er money from realisation of assets , to repay the debt . ###If we were then to get to a position like Dorset County Council , who have no debts , they of course can spend a hundred percent of the money they realise from assets . 
296197:66	###It does n't sound quite so good when you put it at that sort of level , cause it puts a school at risk , but of course there 's no reason why a county council should n't borrow considerably more than this council does , looked at on accounting principle , unless I 'm wrong , and Mr I 'm going to call in a minute , will correct me if I am . ###But it seems to me we 've got more than enough assets to cover the borrowings we 've got at the moment and indeed many more besides . 
296393:99	###In other words we get consulted so we get a chance to comment on the planning application when it 's made . ###Can I just comment I think on the process , what happens is , is that in fact the application is made by the director of property services , we do n't now have a first resolution or a second resolution . 
296401:105	###Too often now , in the last four years in planning committee , time and time again , we get applications from departments , and most of them coming from the police authority , for changing residential accommodation to other uses . ###We believe it is morally wrong to be taking away residential accommodation , when there are so many people homeless in our society , and we should do something about it . 
296419:104	###but the particular council which is Elmbridge District Council , started off after last year 's victory by the Liberal Democrats , by moving to one full council meeting a week , lasting about six hours once a week . ###The chairman then went to the extent of scrapping every committee , and having three full council meetings a week , on the grounds that every member should consider every issue . 
296425:36	###Yes , I mean it , erm , Mr is quite right , and I 'm very surprised at the length of time , I 'm not sure if he 's still in on planning , but he 's certainly been on and off it a lot , erm , has n't worked it out yet . ###Erm , this is part of the legacy of the unspeakable , who changed the presumption to be in favour of development . 
296479:33	###In th , and this is not a school who 's decided to set it face against the county council , and it 's services . ###And Mr will know , that in fact we 've employed quite a few of his services and other services of the county council . 
296499:51	###Thank you Mr Chairman . ###As you 've said before , you know I 'm a privatisation man , er , and I think that comes down to number three , if we privatised the lot and pushed them further out , if they felt there was a need to do building maintenance they could do it . 
296500:18	###As you 've said before , you know I 'm a privatisation man , er , and I think that comes down to number three , if we privatised the lot and pushed them further out , if they felt there was a need to do building maintenance they could do it . ###It 's only while they stay so in-house as a D S O , that we have to be so careful about what we do and what we do n't . 
296504:7	###Mr . ###Thank you Chairman . 
296508:34	###Er , I 'm involved with a school at the moment that in fact has just put Concept Catering out . ###Erm , and the reports that I 've had back from the governors was that Concept Catering was so , so absolutely certain that they were the only people who could do it , that when they were faced with competition , they had n't got the faintest idea how to respond to it . 
296539:18	###In fact erm , what we agreed yesterday was one on this paper , two and three followed from it , erm , but were not actually moved , at the working party , because it was me who did the moving . ###Erm , and er , they are necessary but they are not actually what we agreed . 
296547:7	###Well then I will move one and I will move Mr ' s wording for three , and on two basically delete that the money should come from the identified savings made in the Chief Executive 's department . ###It has the same effect Chair . 
296598:119	###So being able to present effectively and put your point of view across is very important within within the company context for the company in order to to project the right image and also to pro project your own right image . ###To show your value , to demonstrate your worth for the organisation . 
296609:108	###You see towards the bottom er we pose a few questions there , I 'm going to ask you in a few minutes to introduce yourselves and to say what what sort of presentations you make at the moment . ###Now do n't think in terms of presentations just as standing up in front of an audience . 
296658:36	###right , okay ###the main thing I suppose . 
296764:131	###Okay yep ###As I say I do n't want to promise you something and and then and then at the end you say well hang on we did n't look at that because that 's not within the agenda of of these two days . 
296795:66	###I take on board these ideas for these two days . ###At the end of two days you say well fine but it 's not for me I ca n't do anything about that when you walk out the room but I hope my objective is to convince you that here is something that like lots of other people in time I can it 's a very very useful system . 
296865:88	###They all want you to do well . ###That 's right they 're all with me , yeah that 's right because you know that you 've just been there or you 're going to be there yourself . 
296884:9	###Now we 've just said there needs to be some level somewhere if you 're right down this end of the curve here you 're either asleep or dead so there 's some peak performance at some level of anxiety or arousal and as the anxiety increases the performance drops off . ###Okay . 
296884:33	###Now we 've just said there needs to be some level somewhere if you 're right down this end of the curve here you 're either asleep or dead so there 's some peak performance at some level of anxiety or arousal and as the anxiety increases the performance drops off . ###Okay . 
296884:73	###Now we 've just said there needs to be some level somewhere if you 're right down this end of the curve here you 're either asleep or dead so there 's some peak performance at some level of anxiety or arousal and as the anxiety increases the performance drops off . ###Okay . 
296927:33	###Talking right . ###So what 's that about ? 
296946:116	###How do we need to adjust the power when we 're making a presentation ? ###To the size of the audience 
296958:21	###Sorry ###Variety 
297043:82	###Let 's make sure we did n't use any term that everybody understands yeah . ###understand what 
297048:24	###Simplified that 's right . ###Where the jargon might arise would be perhaps in response to questions from an architect for instance yes . 
297048:101	###Simplified that 's right . ###Where the jargon might arise would be perhaps in response to questions from an architect for instance yes . 
297087:40	###So presenting the centre line and okay we 're going to come on to the eye contact as well in a moment , presenting the centre line with eye contact means that it feels much more positive for the audience in terms of the delivery . ###So the centre line is an is an important aspect of Now if you 're holding your notes yeah I I mean that 's not a very open sort of centre line is it because I 've got this as a barrier . 
297091:28	###The third aspect the third aspect that er noticed was movement of the feet whilst in this sort of a situation . ###In any communication and Mike used that term and this is what this is about in communication there is a gap it does n't matter whether it 's you know writing a letter making a phone call or just standing this sort of distance away . 
297093:69	###There 's a gap over which these words have to flow . ###Yes , there 's a gap in this communication . 
297094:31	###Yes , there 's a gap in this communication . ###Now if I stood here all the time for two days and presented to you just standing here do your eyes move have to move if you 're watching me all the time your eyes are fixed are n't they in one position ? 
297141:151	###What else then what other methods do we have besides having eye contact what else might we do to involve the audience to make them feel involved ? ###Questions 
297175:80	###If they get in if they start getting in the way the best thing to do is just let them relax to the side and try and forget about them , I know it 's difficult to forget about them but just to the conscious effort with the hands is just to put them at the side . ###Then as you start to make the point you 'll find your hands will come up naturally and bend from the elbows it sounds crazy to say but if if you suddenly go coo I 've got everything in me pocket but 
297178:12	###six pairs of opposites and then expanded by Okay now that that 's fine but how do you move on and where do you move on to in order to get that structured thought pattern ? ###If you 're going to come and stand and present something to somebody there 's got to be a reason for it ? 
297235:52	###Cabbages ###all these cabbages yeah . 
297305:73	###Of performance against arousal levels and we agreed that the the purpose of training like this and also putting these principles into practice is to be able to handle more and more arousal er more and more nerves and still and still be able to perform in a confident manner . ###We then talked about the first of those two towers of Tower Bridge if you remember which was about the skills that we need for er delivery . 
297329:57	###and then we use this method to then go a stage further to prepare for the second presentation . ###So I gave you a topic sport or a hobby or an interest that you had and you produced a thought pattern for that just as we 'd done in the practice one with the subject of water , but then we moved on a stage further to get what are called a structured thought pattern . 
297340:81	###Got through quite a bit yesterday did n't we ? ###Quite a bit there er when you lay it out like that in a pattern a thought pattern which shows just how much er we did actually get through er from where you started at ten in the morning or just after with the presentation right through to the second presentation . 
297382:68	###Okay ? ###Morning everybody erm the three points that were important for me yesterday were the Aldershot method the the arousal curve and the need for audience contact . 
297383:66	###Morning everybody erm the three points that were important for me yesterday were the Aldershot method the the arousal curve and the need for audience contact . ###I particularly found the Aldershot method important because what it gives you is a clear structure to what you have to say when you stand up if you 're going to introduce by saying what you 're going to say before you expand and then at the end summarise and bring it all back to a nice conclusion . 
297433:37	###So to summarise the thought patterns the Aldershot method Jeff ###The three things that came out of yesterday for meself were the the Aldershot method the delivery . 
297434:29	###The three things that came out of yesterday for meself were the the Aldershot method the delivery . ###The Aldershot principally because it gave a structure to what I had to say at least went up there fairly confident of what I had . 
297450:195	###Erm the three things I I er got most out of yesterday were the structured thought patterns , playback and the audience contact . ###The structured the structured thought patterns gave me an actual er organisation to my talk be it only just a few words on a piece of paper it was simple yet er gave the organisation to the actual talk while you stood up in front of an audience . 
297513:122	###er absolutely , yeah it keeps the interest going does n't it ? ###So it 's it 's an interest thing as well it keeps the interest it changes the emphasis switches the attention makes a break does n't it it just changes er er a natural break that happens and it changes attention . 
297670:29	###my Lord our immediate concern is precisely the one you 've identified , the collection of monies from central ###yeah 
297805:12	###although I suspect there 's , there 's what you 're gonna stand on ###they , er , they may well my Lord 
297815:208	###was that it would er have implications in the United Kingdom amounted to some sixty billion and the attorney general came to Luxembourg to tell the court about the dire consequences , er your Lordship raised consequences in the context of an arguments under article five ###yes 
297831:76	###er my Lord yes ###I quite agree , but if they , if those exists well then there 's a , erm well , I suppose again Mr might actually then adopt even further my article five suggestion 
297871:151	###well you would if , I think it 's unsatisfactory er to get to ask Mr to deal with Mr ###yes my Lord 
297877:20	###erm ###under very great stress he 's , already lost one judge because this 
297903:71	###we saw as probably being fairly strong in the corporate finance field . ###we saw as being very strong again in tax er and certainly in the er , in the major fields , these fields . 
297916:9	###That it 's quite a long time to achieve . ###We audit ten of the forty main requirements in Manchester but as I said earlier taking P G 's and P W 's as being er predominant in the larger plc markets . 
297939:56	###Diligence , next one specific er to the er to the tax practice was the need to sort to establish er a a pensions er capability A B C capability , er Leeds office has had an A B C capability for er I think it 's erm six or seven years , something in that order . ###The number of people involved in the sort of work there was er something like twelve to twelve and fifteen people er added up er responsible for A B C. So it did n't make any sense to us to think well if Leeds have got a million pound practice there , why have we got nothing here . 
297939:105	###Diligence , next one specific er to the er to the tax practice was the need to sort to establish er a a pensions er capability A B C capability , er Leeds office has had an A B C capability for er I think it 's erm six or seven years , something in that order . ###The number of people involved in the sort of work there was er something like twelve to twelve and fifteen people er added up er responsible for A B C.

297956:9	###Er and so we are looking at ways in which we can actually erm develop this and the firm as a whole is doing that as well and er we are to a certain extent that initiative . ###We 've also er recently been talking to erm a lecturer of the University who is doing a project , a research project , and would like to er offer his services to us in in that er in that project , so we at the early stages but nonetheless I think it is er very important that we do er test the market place and find out what both think of us , so that we with a prime and only objective of improving a service

298011:177	###But how ? ###Because they 're going to have to , at the end of their period of whether it 's a year or eighteen months , they will hopefully be qualified for a national vocational qualification level three and in order to gain that they have to be assessed constantly throughout their eighteen months , there 's no kind of 
298198:32	###Right . ###Now . 
298202:19	###Firstly , on how far it flies and secondly on its aesthetic value . ###First can I just ask , as , as somebody who 's building a paper aeroplane you got assumption whatsoever , so am I supposed to say I do n't know the first thing about making a paper aeroplane , you you told me . 
298233:21	###Group one ###Have we got to make one in front of you ? 
298248:25	###This one 's a little bit of ornamentation . ###You 've cracked it . 
298382:15	###That it is over something over which I have no control . ###I I 've already made a ruling on that , on that point . 
298386:242	###Er er that that o o order , order , it 's a very good question er but I fear not that it is up to individual members themselves to exercise some restraint and to and to u order , order , and to use the procedures of this house properly and correctly and not to abuse them . ###Yes Mr Cryer . 
298434:28	###Full consultations with relevant voluntary organisations representing disabled people . ###Bodies such as Links and the Spastic Society which produce quite a substantial report at the last election to illustrate what the problems were then there will be established designated polling stations in which there will be various characteristics required such as wheelchair access , unaided wheelchair access , although the problem of accessibility is for more people than those people who are in wheelchairs and many people who are not registered disabled and are mainly old and infirm , should have the opportunity to exercise their franchise readily and easily . 
298465:9	###Well , no I ca n't give er my honourable friends the ins and outs of the negotiations . ###They followed as far as possible in the time available , the practices and procedures of the permanent parliamentary boundary commission , indeed of the six members of the committees , five were members of the parliamentary boundary commissions and they were appointed to the committees after consultation with the opposition parties . 
298480:91	###Er , if they do n't , the commencement will not take place and we will continue on the existing boundaries , that would , and I 'll give way to my honourable friend in a moment , that of course would create massive inconvenience , I see no er real reason why the other states er which have yet to ratify should not do so er but my honourable friend I think wanted to intervene with a further thought on this point so I give way to her . ###No , all I was curious to know was , er the commencement yes , but I mean w could you take it right up to the sort of the tapes until the day before the elections , or what would be the limit on that ? 
298486:22	###minister 's well aware , this is causing considerable concern amongst the small percent of the population in Southend-on-Sea who are interested in European elections because the proposal is that instead of the links with Chelmsford , as we are at present , we 're going to be linked with Thurrock , which of course is something different . ###Now what my constituents who are interested would like to know is , what actually does President Mitterrand want ? 
298489:197	###I give way to the honourable gentlemen . ###Is n't there a precedent for all this muddle ? and opt out clause . 
298495:119	###I thought I heard him say that there was some discretion in this matter , if the French do n't go ahead there is some discretion on the part of the British government , I thought it was automatic that if the French do n't ratify then we wo n't be able to ratify . ###What I said was there was some discretion was in the hands of the Home Secretary when he brought forward that commencement date and what he would have in mind is of course the er er not merely what happens er er i er erm in the er er our colleague countries in the community on their commencing er their changes , er but also in the kind of time we would actually need , political parties would need , candidates would need , to run an efficient election campaign here . 
298518:34	###The general principal of article eight B two of the Maastricht treaty is that non-national residents in member state should be treated for electoral purposes in the same way as the nationals of that state . ###The draft regulations seek to achieve that equality of treatment in practice and we are not introducing of our own accord any requirements on citizens of other member states which we do not require of our own citizens .

298530:106	###Question is as on the order paper , Mr Graham Allett . ###Er Mr Deputy Speaker I 'm glad er at last after some further delay that members of this house have the opportunity to discuss the important matter of the boundaries on which the European elections will be fought on June the ninth and the extension to the vote to E C citizens in the U K for those elections . 
298532:89	###Er , the European project goes on and for many of the newer generations in this place , it 's not longer an article of faith er but a part of the political landscape that has to be dealt with on merit and it 's all the more ludicrous therefore Mr Deputy Speaker , that the Conservatives ' internal divisions over Maastricht have led to a situation where candidates for the ever more important European elections are only now being selected in certain seats , just fourteen weeks before the election . ###Given the size of the European constituencies , it will be difficult , if not impossible , for some candidates to become widely known and for an informed choice to be made . 
298536:85	###It took from the Edinburgh summit in December nineteen ninety two , when the current Prime Minister first announced the government 's intention to legislate on this issue , until the thirtieth of June nineteen ninety three before the European parliamentary elections bill had its first reading . ###Now we all know that the reason for this inordinate six month delay was that the government could n't be sure of carrying a vote on anything European in the face of hostility from its Maastricht rebels , those the Prime Minister famously dubbed the illegitimate ones . 
298540:7	###As we know , the organisation of business er is n't their strong point at the moment , whether its been run ragged by their own rebels or clumsily breaking down the usual channels , seems our non- cooperation policy is merely an extension of the one that 's been working so effectively inside the Conservative party under the present Prime Minister . ###Amidst all that confusion , I think it is important that the procedures used in this parliamentary review should never be deployed as a precedent for future boundary revision , for either Strasbourg or Westminster .

298602:60	###Mr Deputy Speaker we live in dark days for our democracy . ###Days of executive decree , Henry the eighth clauses and bills being agreed without proper parliamentary debate . 
298603:76	###Days of executive decree , Henry the eighth clauses and bills being agreed without proper parliamentary debate . ###I suppose in that context we should be grateful that ministers have not used the power that they have to modify the recommendations of the boundary committees . 
298631:39	###Well since that debate the government has taken the decision to introduce the duty into a fifth regulated sector friendly societies and a negative resolution order under the friendly societies act nineteen ninety two is also is also prop be N reasons for taking action across this wide front Madam Deputy Speaker , first and most important , the relevant provisions in the various acts are very similar and if we are to bolster the arrangements in relation to banks then we should do the same for other sectors entrusted with the public 's investments . ###All with ensuring their daily risks . 
298661:25	###Hear , hear . ###I I 'm very grateful to the minister for his patience but er on the other hand it could be argued that it 's no use having a duty to report fraud unless you also have a duty to detect fraud . 
298663:157	###The auditing profession er argues , and I must say the audit practice board 's er er proposals are very , for very passive auditing , the audit profession argues that it 's difficult to detect fraud but on the other hand er the local government er act er local government finance act of nineteen eighty two requires local authority auditors to have er er er a duty to search for unlawful acts and report on them . ###Now if that 's good for the local authority goose , why is n't it good for the banking gander when so much more money is involved . 
298695:71	###The first one is what exactly the duty is so far as the auditor is concerned . ###I notice that the phraseology adopted in each of the orders is different . 
298697:86	###If we look at the insurance order and the one relating to building societies , it is quite clear there that the auditor has to be acting in his capacity o er as auditor . ###Now the minister er er when in his speech earlier , er made the point that he thought that the proper interpretation in respect of all of these orders was a fairly wide one . 
298700:49	###But of course the minister in his speech earlier went far wider than that er he seemed to imply that it was n't just er th er duty on the accountant er acting in capa his capacity as an auditor but er the the accountant would have the same duty if acting as an accountant , tax advisor or indeed in any other capacity . ###Now that is to paint a far wider duty than I had been er er er thought and indeed er those who follow these matters have suggested that 's rather wider than the than the er secondary legislation here before us actually provides for . 
298702:182	###Clearly it will be of crucial importance in any er court proceedings because the court will have to decide whether or not an auditor was in breech of his or her duty having regard to what is on the face of the statute . ###Now I know erm following a fairly recent er er er case in the house of lords that the courts are er entitled to rely on what ministers say in debate but perhaps the minister could er spell out a little bit more clearly the apparent discrepancy between what he said in his speech and what is on the face of these orders and indeed why it is that the orders in r relation to banking and financial services , adopts a different phraseology er to that used in the orders relating to insurance and building societies . 
298743:122	###I assume that if they can bring themselves within the terms of erm of these orders then they will er be indemnified . ###The question that arises though is if they can bring themselves only within er the er words used by the minister , will they be protected ? 
298749:115	###Now yes . ###I think that , if I may say so , is a mistaken view because because of the proliferation of rules and regulations he 's probably right , another quango or another body is needed . 
298756:240	###Madam er deputy speaker , there is a feeling abroad in the country that an audit certificate is rather like an M O T certificate , it 's good for the minute that it was granted but it is perfectly useless thereafter . ###I understand it 's run into some difficulty but I urge the minister to press the commission to get a move on because this this is a problem that does n't just affect this country , it is certainly a problem that affects the whole of Europe and the European union in particular but also the the er the whole of the world and it 's something that needs international action . 
298802:90	###As a nation we are now obsessed to the point of paralysis with rules and regulations . ###It 's surprising one can move without some rule impeding on one 's freedom , so concerned is the state on on the issues of welfare , hygiene , security and safety matters . 
298806:109	###One ca n't actually separate them , although you will try to , from all the other rules and regulations we are passing all over the place . ###But Madam Deputy Speaker I will appear . 
298819:198	###Except to note that now that the right honourable member for Chesterfield is publishing his former speeches as a video , it is rather a cheap operation to come and repeat them in the chamber er rather than putting them out er for public consumption there are places where he could repeat the kind of speeches just given , unfortunately the government is closing most of them down at the moment and putting the cut the inhabitants out in the community er but it had no relevance to the er the subject we 're dealing with today . ###Talking of reruns Madam er deputy speaker , er I almost feel I 'm involved in a series of reruns with the er with the minister himself because er in a series of bills er committees in the eighties , standing committees on the building societies bill , on the banking bill , on the financial services er bill , as they all were , er he was speaking at that time er in favour of more effective regulation , backing the votes of this side er for kind , the kind of policies it 's introducing today . 
298833:57	###Is that what he 's saying ? ###We do n't even have an effective definition of who the auditors er are are are responsible to . 
298839:82	###In this instance there 's nothing er and er justice Bingham er did say specifically that he was n't pursuing er the matter of er audit , it was n't his responsibility er the government should certainly have repaired that omission by pursuing it themselves , by inquiring er into er what went wrong . ###Ministers say well the serious fraud office is looking into it but that has n't precluded inquiries er in other cases like London United Investments and Maxwell er so there should be an inquiry er into the audit of B C C I so we know exactly what went wrong . 
298862:10	###Regulation eight authorises electoral registration officers to register relevant citizens of the union as European parliamentary electors and regulation nine requires the officer to publish a register of relevant citizens of the union entitled to vote . ###However delay has meant that the ordinary electoral register is already published so regulation eighteen substitutes publication date of May the ninth for the European community citizens register . 
298875:100	###So could I therefore ask the minister to , on another matter , to ensure that later in his remarks would he agree to the proposal that the right to a postal vote should be highly publicised in this country , perhaps by putting the R P F nine A form in the newspapers well before the closing date of May the twentieth . ###Not least because of our course many people will be away er during the Summer on their holidays and some indeed may well be involved in the D-day celebrations . 
298883:15	###Here , here . ###Mr Michael Spicer . 
298896:17	###Very good ###Mr Matthew Taylor . 
298940:167	###If you look in other parts of Europe Luxembourg and the Republic of Ireland for example , the figures are as low as thirty six thousand and a hundred and sixty one thousand electors per member er respectively so the precise sizes of the constituencies is not the most material er issue in this case . ###The European parliament has a wide range of electorate per member and the electoral quota would not be extraordinary were Cornwall to get its own seat . 
298948:21	###Attributes for it er firmly rooted in a Celtic past that frankly bears more relation to Wales and Scotland than it does er to the past er in Devon . ###There would have been objections if areas of Scotland or Wales had been linked with parts of England for convenience er of this review , but it seems Cornwall once again as a distinct and separate identity , continues to be ignored . 
298989:10	###It does n't affect the value of anybody 's vote in those countries at all . ###That cannot be the case in a single member constituency arrangement .

299000:65	###Mr Teddy Taylor . ###Mr Deputy Speaker . 
299001:7	###Mr Deputy Speaker . ###I just wanted to say three brief things about the boundaries , before doing so I think I may have to declare a personal interest . 
299023:7	###On that very point sir I 'm grateful to the honourable member for giving way but would he not agree with me that actually the failure of G A T at the end was that by which Caribbean bananas failed to be protected . ###Mr Deputy Speaker I I would n't be in order to go into this but I do n't agree at all , as the honourable gentleman 's well aware , that filthy protectionism of the C A P forces up prices of food for the average family in Britain by twenty eight pounds a week . 
299023:46	###On that very point sir I 'm grateful to the honourable member for giving way but would he not agree with me that actually the failure of G A T at the end was that by which Caribbean bananas failed to be protected . ###Mr Deputy Speaker I I would n't be in order to go into this but I do n't agree at all , as the honourable gentleman 's well aware , that filthy protectionism of the C A P forces up prices of food for the average family in Britain by twenty eight pounds a week . 
299027:74	###Absolutely right Mr Deputy Speaker and I just wish that members would n't raise these irrelevant points . ###What I do say to the honourable gentleman is his argument is rubbish , bad for the third world , bad for the people of Europe and outside Mr Deputy Speaker I 'd be glad to give him his answer although quite rightly to say I ca n't give it here . 
299030:70	###My understanding is that the European parliament has got so many buildings now including a great new building at Brussels built at huge cost , enormous cost and a new building they want to build at Strasbourg . ###They 're now paying rentals of twenty four million pounds a year . 
299030:202	###My understanding is that the European parliament has got so many buildings now including a great new building at Brussels built at huge cost , enormous cost and a new building they want to build at Strasbourg . ###They 're now paying rentals of twenty four million pounds a year . 
299044:8	###As the Secretary of State for foreign affairs said to me , twenty eight pounds a week extra per family , including the honourable gentleman 's constituents . ###really it 's er testing my patience now I 'm afraid . 
299089:145	###There will be a a a series of new constituencies created across the East Midlands . ###The electorate will expect to know who the candidates are in those er er particular constituencies . 
299111:14	###All this was known to the auditors , they did n't spill the beans . ###Now why have we not had an inquiry which will bring out what happened in the case of B C C I so we can base proper and effective regulation er on that er in i in in in in inquiry . 
299121:10	###We pointed out them from this side of the house er the local government 's finance act does impose both duties . ###Now the audit industry was in favour of that at the time because it saw itself as able to get its fingers into local authority audit so they were prepared to accept that they could do it then , it 's only now er when it 's proposed on what 's been their traditional prerogatives , they er er they audit of banks and private sector er er companies that they balk at the proposition and say ooh it 's horrendous we ca n't do it . 
299140:99	###Now my honourable friend has already quoted er the presence the , o of the department of trade in this er er pointing out in er his book er where there 's a will there 's a corpse er er that er there should n't be a conflict of interest because accountancy firms should n't do other work . ###That should be a paramount objective er in financial institutions because D T I inquiries have indicated er that the work is less adequate er when er they 're relying er on when a man is checking his own figures or those of a colleague , that was er er in at the roadships erm re report . 
299143:7	###Now what kind of a sanction is that er to make the auditors actually do the job properly . ###We need an effective independent regulator , not the mafia regulating mafia and saying it 's quite understandable boy , we 'll let you off this time which is what happens now er with the Institute of Chartered Accountants er as a recognised supervisory body er in this er in this particular field . 
299146:16	###The Secretary of State er told me er that the has been no occasion where criticism from a companies auditors by my department 's inspectors in reports published since June nineteen seventy nine has led to an audit partner being excluded from membership of a professional accountancy body , er and no auditor criticised in D T I inspector 's reports has been debarred from auditing as a result of information er in that report . ###So bearing in mind the government itself has never iss er initiated any criminal action against auditors criticised in D T I reports , there are no effective sanctions . 
299149:115	###Here , here . ###Mr John Greenway . 
299162:7	###But the underlying purpose , that of reducing unnecessary bureaucracy , stripping away the red tape which hinders enterprise and good er governance in this country , is something that the government is very committed to and we intend to promulgate that doctrine throughout all the areas and that of course is being taken forward in legislation . ###As far as er the honourable gentleman for Edinburgh Central is concerned , he said there was a case for a wider inquiry into the auditing o of companies , well that is not something specifically called for er by Bingham although I acknowledge that a case can be made for that but I think we want to be extremely careful before extending that in the way that he and the honourable member for Great Grimsby proposed beyond the direct er responsibility to the members or the owners of the company . 
299190:102	###This includes the sum of eighty six million for care in the community , it is an increase of four point two percent or over one hundred million pounds extra cash compared with nineteen ninety three , ninety four . ###I thank the Secretary of State for giving way , he he did say that erm er the figures in these report were in a sense provisional at the end of last year , erm but that he feels erm , with the passing of time , nothing has happened to change his view . 
299314:44	###That itself is some forty million pounds below the association of Welsh counties assessment of what is actually needed to meet the needs of the community and it is in any event not available for general spending . ###So if that figure is removed from the spending total the current increase is only two point three percent above the settlement for nineteen ninety three , ninety four and being twenty eight million pounds , or one percent , below the current years budgets actually represents a four percent real terms reduction and that is a measure of the cuts which the government this year wishes to force on local government . 
299315:11	###So if that figure is removed from the spending total the current increase is only two point three percent above the settlement for nineteen ninety three , ninety four and being twenty eight million pounds , or one percent , below the current years budgets actually represents a four percent real terms reduction and that is a measure of the cuts which the government this year wishes to force on local government . ###Under any circumstances this would be difficult enough but this year Welsh local government has to suffer the commu the cumulative burden of previous years cuts . 
299321:29	###At the same time yes I I 'll happily give way to the honourable gentleman . ###Specific point of the South Wales police authority 's difficulties , would he not say that at least they 're partly due to the police authority believing that it was going to be er underspending in the current year and being out in its calculations by about two million pounds , would n't you think that that was at least a factor ? 
299326:85	###Is the honourable gentleman unaware that the district auditor has in fact indicated that there is a total lack of accountability or any sort of proper financial control in the police authority . ###Is he as the shadow spokesman for Wales , unaware of that ? 
299327:7	###Is he as the shadow spokesman for Wales , unaware of that ? ###But of course , of course is if there is any evidence whatsoever er of financial mismanagement in the police authority it is a matter which has to be properly investigated . 
299417:15	###Will he also ask the Americans how , as he claims , they 've created eighteen million jobs with a minimum wage provision and also make clear how much Britain is paying in family credit support to maintain low paid subsidised wages by the tax payer in this country ? ###Still the honourable gentleman talks down Britain . 
299417:34	###Will he also ask the Americans how , as he claims , they 've created eighteen million jobs with a minimum wage provision and also make clear how much Britain is paying in family credit support to maintain low paid subsidised wages by the tax payer in this country ? ###Still the honourable gentleman talks down Britain . 
299428:15	###What I would hope that we could achieve in this country is more through erm opportunities for disabled people , greater opportunities for disabled people to gain access into work and as my honourable friend knows , we have put forward some proposals we 're presently considering the position following the representations that have been made to us after the er new access to work scheme was announced and I hope to make an announcement on that aspect shortly . ###But I just say to my honourable friend I do n't think er compulsion er is the route with that we should follow . 
299502:35	###Tony Banks . ###Is the , is the minister , is the minister aware that Barclays have laid off or declared seven thousand redundancies . 
299512:43	###David Conolly . ###Er er Madam Speaker er non-wage costs never get into employees wage packets but do make it more expensive for employers to provide a job . 
299520:10	###Alex Carlisle . ###Given the favourable non-wage labour cost which the minister told us about a moment ago , how does he justify the enormous discrepancy in wages between England and Wales as an average and areas like South Wales and Northumberland where average weekly earnings are up to sixty five pounds less than the average and will he explain to us why the government is not tackling huge wage differentials in this country ?

299523:175	###If he had his way , and we signed up for the social chapter , those extra costs would have to be met out of those pay packets and there 'd be even less for people to take in wages so the honourable gentleman should n't be complaining about low pay when he wants to add to the costs of employment along with the rest of his party . ###Michael Bates . 
299571:17	###Madam Speaker , what er I and my right honourable friend will go on emphasising is the contribution which our tax policies are making to the economic strength and the improved standards of living of this country . ###Mrs Beckett . 
299572:9	###Mrs Beckett . ###But as the Lord President must be aware my honourable friend , the Shadow Chief Secretary , has questions tabled to this government about the extra taxes people will pay in nineteen ninety five to which an answer is not being provided .

299673:72	###The honourable gentleman trying my patience now please get back to the boundaries of the . ###Point of order , Mr Bill Cash . 
299690:85	###I give way to the honourable gentleman . ###Briefly , I thank the minister for giving way . 
299702:16	###But can I refer to the honourable member for Truro er again he talked about P R , he thought that it would somehow , if we move that the there for this election it would save some time . ###It most certainly would n't . 
299762:11	###But I think it 's important to make the distinction , learning about religion or actually teaching for belief . ###It is learning about religion it 's an educational process and it has an importance , whether it 's learning about religion and whether its learning it as a cultural , historical and a religious er tradition of the country and that is what is important . 
299769:74	###Hear ! ###Hear ! 
299798:28	###My Lords , it 's a question of cost in the long run , but er the reason that the our British Library will have fewer than the French Library is originally it was planned to have three thousand places , but er further er examination which has really been taken undertaken very , very thoroughly has proved that this is really not necessary . ###My Lords , may I declare an interest in this question as a user of the British Library . 
299802:57	###the case that most people regard the way in which the National Library has been built and planned as a total national disaster and a vast waste of public money . ###No , My Lords , I entirely disagree with the Noble Lord er furthermore as I 've already said we 're talking the builders site not the library in today 's question . 
299832:140	###Yes , My Lords , and certainly undertake to do that . ###I would like to set this into context though , because over thirteen million attend accident and emergency departments annually . 
299836:102	###If beds are blocked by for example geriatric patients er in medical or even surgical wards , wo n't there be a trickle effect and therefore it will be impossible for the patients who need to go up to these other wards to get out of the A and E department ? ###My Noble Friend is absolutely right er it is a er essential that the erm hospital does have a good discharge policy that there are community facilities to support people once they leave hospital er and My Lords we know that with some of the new procedures that are now being introduced er that is possible and that when a patient comes in for treatment , a discharge policy is worked out almost immediately so that the support services can be given when the time comes for that person to leave . 
299838:42	###has the Minister er studied the Royal College of Nursing Report which was published early last month , which shows that in a third of accident and emergency units in hospitals , patients actually have to stay overnight er before they are admitted to er a ward and would she a accept that this really is not a satisfactory situation , it 's actually worse i outside London than it is in London , contrary to some views . ###The average waiting time is five-and-a-half hours . 
299840:89	###Is not this really a situation to which er she and her colleagues must er address their mind ? ###My Lords , I found a very interesting er aspect in the Royal College of Nursing 's review was that resources were not the issue , the Royal College itself came down in favour of the fact that it was management that needed to be tightened up and My Lords it was interesting looking at that survey that it was a telephone survey and in one of the two hospitals er one or two of the hospitals that were rung up , it was quite difficult to find the person who 'd answered the survey . 
299844:102	###Baroness said she found it absolutely accept unacceptable for patients to wait in the corridor on trolleys . ###Did she mean the word absolutely literally enough to prepare prepared to commit extra money to preventing it ? 
299928:13	###The Transport Police investigate more crime than twenty four other police forces . ###In nineteen ninety two , ninety three they were called upon to investigate one thousand two hundred and thirty seven crimes of violence , I exclude , for various reasons those committed on the London Underground . 
299936:59	###I hope that we will be assured in unequivocal terms that er Government members will be introduced to this Bill probably at the report stage . ###Third , assuming that amendments are introduced to rectify these errors , what will happen in the period between April and the day when this Bill gets the Royal Assent . 
299938:57	###Presumably the rest of the police service overburdened with er investigations of crime as they are , will have to carry the burden caused by the Department of Transport 's errors . ###I would be grateful if the Noble Earl was able to answer these questions . 
299940:78	###Next , has the Association of Chief Police Officers yet been told that as from April they will have to take on this burden of work which has been removed from the British Transport Police as a result of an error in a Government Bill . ###If they have been so informed , I would be very grateful if I could be told on what date they were told . 
299941:107	###If they have been so informed , I would be very grateful if I could be told on what date they were told . ###I am sure the Government will appreciate the indignation that they will feel overburdened as they are with work , that they will now have to use their scarce resources to deal with criminal conduct arising on the railways and lastly , who is going to pay for this work ? 
299961:120	###In British Transport Police may act as constables in , on and in the vicinity of Rail Track 's property and my Right Honourable Friend , the Secretary of State for Transport is at presently urg er at present er urgently considering in conjunction with British Rail and the British Transport Police whether the wording represents a problem and if it is , how best to address it . ###My Lords er my er the Noble Lord , Lord er asked whether the Government would bring an amendment er , er down at report stage . 
299974:75	###there is no doubt about the matter at all that power as constables I have been inadvertently removed by the Department of Transport that is reality . ###At the same time , I have asked a number of questions which I , if I may so , have not been answered . 
299976:185	###I did ask whether the Association of Chief Police Officers have been told that they are going to they are likely to have to take over many of the responsibilities of the British Transport Police as from the first of April . ###I asked that question , it has not been answered . 
299985:60	###contrary not content , the contents have it . ###Clause Two of Amendment Number Four , Lord Payton of 
299999:121	###It will be comforting to me at any rate personally to know that even so eminent a , a , er an ornament of the present administration as my Noble Friends also found these th th this material a matter for stumbling and was not perhaps inclined to give it a crown of lucidity . ###Er My Lords , I do n't wish to prolong my remarks too much , but I really seriously believe that this is not the way in which legislative procedures should be carried out . 
300005:30	###Hear ! ###I , I , I am certainly not that man , I would , I would not dream of offering myself for such a ghastly post 
300012:131	###My Noble Friend Lord was if I may say so his usual wonderful combination of modesty and vehemence has erm drawn our attention to the very confused situation which arose . ###After the er Police Act nineteen sixty four had been in force for some years and when the government of the day which you supporters in the nineteen seventies and later , tried to erm modify it in order to er make a dovetail with local government reforms which we supported . 
300056:48	###Let me give an example of how this might work in terms of numbers . ###If you were to have as as there w is in Greater Manchester at the moment er a political compos composition of the councils where you would get from eight er lo local authority members er five Labour two Conservative and one Liberal Democrat .

300073:35	###As I said on the second reading , I do believe that some areas will need to have larger authorities because of their size , or indeed their particular problems , geographical and otherwise . ###I also welcome Amendment twenty-seven which sets out plans for the appointment by the Secretary of State for members of authorities which will have sanction of having to come before Parliament before accepted and I think that again is extremely important . 
300074:7	###I also welcome Amendment twenty-seven which sets out plans for the appointment by the Secretary of State for members of authorities which will have sanction of having to come before Parliament before accepted and I think that again is extremely important . ###Against the background of the changes proposed to the Government we have to consider the members of the authority and the appointment of some members . 
300077:59	###I am glad therefore that the idea of appointed or co-opted members as well as magistrates seen now to be pretty widely accepted if I understand the Noble Lord , Lord ' s amendment . ###I have come to the same conclusion that some a method of appointment is in fact right and it makes sense . 
300081:12	###That I know is the very strong view of my Right Honourable Friend , the Home Secretary and indeed , also amongst a good many members in another place and indeed in Your Lordships House . ###I therefore come down firmly in favour of a principle of appointed members . 
300101:147	###My Lords , to those who er who have objected to erm a body of large numbers o o need to reduce it to sixteen er I would say that those on the er my Noble Friends on the front bench would do very well to give their attention to the possibility of reducing the number of the cabinet er to sixteen er er er I w er forebear from making er detailed suggestions ###as to which of those distinguished people should be dispensed with , but nevertheless it might be the advantage of everybody if the numbers of the cabinet were reduced to sixteen , I personally thought that for a very long time . 
300109:259	###Er under the Government proposals , if the other two non-elected elements on the authority combined and then elected one of their number as chairman , perhaps at a meeting when a couple of the local authority representatives could n't be present , then the local authority members would in effect be in a minority . ###These bodies My Lords are after all precepting authorities and I think it crucial that those who 've been elected by their local communities should be in a clear majority and I sympathise very much with the er proposition in this regard , set out in the Noble Lord , Lord ' s Amendment number twenty-one . 
300110:185	###These bodies My Lords are after all precepting authorities and I think it crucial that those who 've been elected by their local communities should be in a clear majority and I sympathise very much with the er proposition in this regard , set out in the Noble Lord , Lord ' s Amendment number twenty-one . ###As regards size , to come to the second point , the Government amendments still seem to contemplate that sixteen should be the norm er but in practice , I would expect a great many exceptions to be made where for example there are number of constituent authorities er as in Greater Manchester er where there 's er a combination of urban areas and large rural areas , or where the authority tends to function through a lot of sub-committees each of which have to be manned as in Greater Man as in Merseyside . 
300156:24	###I fear that does not even begin to address our concern the assurances which were given on the last occasion about the Home Secretary 's attitude by the Noble Earl Lord which will no doubt be repeated later this afternoon , will of course hold good only for as long as Mr Howard is Home Secretary . ###His successors of whatever party will not be bound by anything the Noble Earl may say this afternoon , it is inconceivable that a Home Secretary in five or ten years time , also what Lord say in February nineteen ninety four , I really must n't do whatever er I thought of doing in er that given the fact that the Noble Earl Lord gave certain assurances , he will do whatever he considers on that occasion to be right 
300169:30	###My Lords there is no point in the Government denying that there is such a danger , pressure of precisely this character has been applied on chief officers of police outside our own shores . ###That is why so many of them admire our system of carefully designed checks and balances which has served this nation so well . 
300170:7	###That is why so many of them admire our system of carefully designed checks and balances which has served this nation so well . ###My Lords in a few minutes the House will have to vote on this issue . 
300302:103	###In other words we were , we were considerably concerned about the extent of the war . ###Now you can see what would have happened if McArthur 's advice had , had been followed . 
300313:34	###And the context in which this was er argued er was er the Bay of Pigs invasion of Cuba , a C I A American supported invasion , er which er failed very badly but which certainly indicated the American desire to get rid of Castro and er Khrushchev was asserting in effect that he had as much right to defend an ally as the United States had er to defend erm its allies and in the same sort of way . ###Now Kennedy had a dilemma although Cuba was in the Caribbean , and although the United States had the biggest navy in the world , and the biggest airforce and was easily able to exterminate Cuba if it wa if it wished to , it was vulnerable , however , in other areas , in particular it was vulnerable in Berlin and it was vulnerable in Indo-China . 
300339:104	###No one however at the time questioned why it was necessary to do that . ###What was the significance of keeping South Vietnam in the American fold ? 
300340:57	###What was the significance of keeping South Vietnam in the American fold ? ###No one asked that question , they simply focused upon er the , the communist insurrection in the south and the American , American commitment to the global containment of communism meant that they had to go and do something about it and domestic political pressures were there too er President Kennedy came out of the Cuban missiles crisis a hero because his people mistakenly believed that he 'd won a foreign policy success and that he 'd acted in a restrained and statesmanlike manor . 
300341:29	###No one asked that question , they simply focused upon er the , the communist insurrection in the south and the American , American commitment to the global containment of communism meant that they had to go and do something about it and domestic political pressures were there too er President Kennedy came out of the Cuban missiles crisis a hero because his people mistakenly believed that he 'd won a foreign policy success and that he 'd acted in a restrained and statesmanlike manor . ###Well regardless of the hyperbole and the rhetoric , in fact it was an American defeat er he had to accept the existence of a communist regime in Cuba and to keep his hands off it . 
300343:125	###Now in the case of Vietnam , a decision had to be made to intervene or not to intervene . ###If they 'd not intervened er then indeed the consequences would certainly have been a communist victory so the intervention was necessary to maintain that policy position . 
300370:189	###Erm the world is indeed inter-related erm we are talking in strategic terms of a multilateral er er erm system just as we , as , when we come to the later lectures we will see , as is the case with economic relations . ###What a country does in one part of the world reverberates throughout the system . 
300402:106	###Er and that means that the president 's attention is both diverted from substantive concerns and it also means the president , there 's a limitation on the extent to which the president can appear to be partisan . ###So the president tries to encapsulate the national interest to embody the common good and he puts forward policies , not in any spirit of er personal or partisan advantage , but simply for the good of the nation . 
300403:7	###So the president tries to encapsulate the national interest to embody the common good and he puts forward policies , not in any spirit of er personal or partisan advantage , but simply for the good of the nation . ###And so you have then a political system in which you , which you have a presidency er faced by a powerful legislature , a president who is not part of legislature but who has to lead the legislature without any significant controls over it a very difficult and demanding task . 
300421:7	###During the er civil war Abraham Lincoln er suspended , unilaterally , without consultation , er suspended the writ of habeas corpus who knows what habeas corpus is ? ###Right to a fair trial , any , any advance on that ? 
300423:7	###We must have one lawyer amongst our presence surely . ###Mhm . 
300427:105	###There were arrests , people were detained er without trial , they were n't charged with anything but on suspicion of being spies for the confederacy . ###And Lincoln was criticized , attacked for this , that er and he said in response to this the attention of the country has been called to the proposition that one who is sworn as the constitution says to take care that the laws be faithfully executed should himself not violate those laws a fairly reasonable proposition you might think , if your oath says to uphold the law then you start going round breaking the law er something wrong here somewhere methinks . 
300433:85	###I did understand however that my oath to preserve the constitution to the best of my ability imposed upon me the duty of that nation of which the constitution is the organic law . ###Was it possible rhetorical question was it possible to lose the nation and yet preserve the constitution ? 
300433:106	###I did understand however that my oath to preserve the constitution to the best of my ability imposed upon me the duty of that nation of which the constitution is the organic law . ###Was it possible rhetorical question was it possible to lose the nation and yet preserve the constitution ? 
300566:104	###Well each has a particular history erm each has a particular culture and pattern of doing things , structure of government as I 've mentioned but also of course we have common interests so in foreign policy we sometimes draw differences between what we would regard as the direct interests of each state and what we can call common interests of mankind . ###Now let 's take a couple of examples of those the direct interests of er say in Britain might be er let 's take the example of the fishing industry it 's important in Britain for the fishermen of Britain erm to have the right to be able to maintain their livelihoods and that 's an interest , direct interest , of Britain in negotiating with other countries about fishing rights . 
300568:50	###But there is also a common interest in the world of preserving fishing stock , not over fishing so that in fact you get the depletion of fishing stock , and therefore somehow you have to balance between your particular interests and the common interests . ###I think we 've become erm in recent decades more inter more concerned about common interests because we realize more about them . 
300583:51	###And again , you see this is on the one hand , on the other hand there is some justification in both views . ###Any state has limitations on how it can behave , they 're partly geographical , it does make a difference whether you 're an island or whether you 've got no coastline at all . 
300622:12	###Now who was the state 's interests with other states , was it were you the state 's interests in other states or no , I keep getting you wrong . ###Yes where did I get the state 's interest in other states from ? 
300735:69	###Okay this is the fourth in our series and the second on the presidency and I want to do two things in this lecture . ###The first is to spell out to you the precise erm constitutional position of the president and the second , and perhaps more interestingly , is to talk about the notion of presidential power . 
300788:121	###The president has the power to make treaties but the constitution says only , only if those treaties are approved by two thirds of the senate . ###And if you want to try to understand say something like the er Iran Contra scandal then part of the roots of that scandal lie in the American constitution in the way that there is , th that the president is controlled by other aspects of the constitution . 
300794:14	###One is a theme of er presidential frustration the idea that the presidency of the United States is too weak an institution to cope with the responsibilities that it faces . ###Indeed the best selling book of the nineteen seventies in American politics by a famous historian Arthur Schlesinger Junior called , it was called The Imperial Presidency . 
300830:148	###In the end Harry Truman decided that he really could n't stomach any more of Douglas MacArthur this , this guy was clearly off the planet , you know er and so er President Truman sacked MacArthur and er replaced him as commander in Korea . ###And this is an ex example , as er Newstat first presents it , of presidential power . 
300855:73	###When er the army was instructed by the president to go to Little Rock and enforce the desegregation of schools , they went and they did it . ###But how often , how often are presidents ' decisions or orders complied with ? 
300868:114	###Eighteen months previously President Kennedy had ordered the withdrawal of the American missiles in Turkey but eighteen months later those missiles were still there and when Kennedy was presented with this bargain , bargaining counter by Khrushchev he sort of shouted at his chiefs of staff and secretary of defence and anyone else he could shout at and sort of said what the hell are those missiles still doing in Turkey , I told you eighteen months ago for God 's sake get rid of them ! ###And his adviser said well Mr President you did say we should get rid of the missiles in Turkey but you did n't say when you know , you did n't say by Tuesday morning at ten o' clock or by next week or in three months ' time , you just said withdraw the missiles from Turkey . 
300923:7	###Bill Clinton invests a huge amount of time in persuading people , he likes to work , he likes to work in teams and groups , he does n't like to sit there giving orders . ###If you sit at the White House in the Oval Office and give orders then nothing will happen . 
300930:23	###Now where will we begin . ###We 'll begin with er , John , come on , we 're all laughing at you . 
300933:89	###No you do n't . ###Jenny , , she 's worked for Express for three and half months , and she previously worked for A N C , er , on their pallet service in Sheffield and South Yorkshire area . 
301065:7	###Erm , ###Actually , he could probably get a game . 
301070:68	###Yes , and erm , I 'm very sorry about it , er , because if they 'd breathalysed me I would have failed as well . ###Yes , 
301073:47	###People never used to , years ago , why did it happen like that now ? ###It 's crazy . 
301093:74	###Oh right . ###I mean it 's crazy , why do n't they have the conference time at ten o' clock in the morning , and have the conference and everybody go home at a decent time , it 's silly . 
301101:46	###Er , it 's a shame because er , to be honest I thought it was an excellent conference ###It was 
301199:19	###Erm , the point perhaps of , of , of the thing is , it 's called the Team Focus , and hopefully for that very reason what we 're trying to do is to look at the way in which you can improve your performance together if you like , erm , and it would be very interesting to see what Jack and Linda can contribute to this in that , people who 've worked together for sort of six or seven years , erm , ought to be able to show us something . ###So that 'll be quite interesting , I 'll be interested in seeing all your contributions to this . 
301238:7	###yes ###Right , so we 're looking at the right price as well , O K , and what else are we looking for ? 
301305:71	###I mean we 've got to pay for good , the way , the way that the business is at the moment , because everyone 's going next day now , no-one wants three day , ###That 's right . 
301312:10	###Eh , it 's dropped off ###And it 's got a right there , and the 
301313:13	###And it 's got a right there , and the ###, it must be carriage free , , said to these fell on Superman . 
301317:57	###And when he gets it on , the , the C and D truck it sets off , what happens when he stops at the first set of traffic lights ? or turns out ? ###It cuts through the back doors . 
301363:205	###Because you make four times as much money do n't you ? ###Erm , that is what 's happened to the business is n't it . 
301389:204	###You know what it costs to run , switch the lights on , you know what it costs to run a conveyor belt for goodness sake , and yet it , and if , if you , if you lose money on , on shifting one parcel , I know if you shift a hundred thousand you might make something , but the chances are high that you wo n't , and , and I mean there are people shifting more parcels than us , I know that , they ca n't make any money out of it . ###I mean it just appalled me I think that we are all of us , if you like to a degree , tarred with the same brush are n't we ? 
301400:39	###And ###And some of the people could n't take it could they ? 
301402:70	###Some of the people who had suddenly become saleswomen , they had to go , because they could n't cope with that . ###They were pretty good at making appointments but they could n't cope with sales , and there 's been a tremendous change in that over the last two years . 
301441:166	###When you get a bit more wool on your back you know it does n't work like that does it ? ###And what I would like us to do is to be able when we leave here tomorrow , to say that by what we 've learned about one another , and by what we 've actually decided , that we can probably improve what we 're doing by something between five and ten percent . 
301506:14	###Yes , and that 's obviously where she 's getting , we 're getting new business from . ###Yes 
301538:124	###Well , obviously nine until ten , ten until eleven , eleven until twelve . ###Right , so you 've got sort of nine to midday ? 
301540:186	###Yes , alright , yes , I mean I have n't done it like that , I 've got to analyse it through green , when I actually was aware that I was stopping doing my B M S and had to do something else for whatever reason . ###I think the main thing is there 's about six hours sort of realistically speaking of really good quality hours to be on your B M S set during the day , and just to sort of add up the hours that you are actually on the phone making outgoing calls , sort of brings it home to you . 
301563:24	###And it does n't happen very often , it was more a one-off , but it was also very necessary , because of the different types of jobs , it , it was n't just sales people sitting in there , it 's was people different departments , cab drivers from outside and we had , yes , ###We had the engineers up , but we had everyone , but ours started at one thirty 
301626:107	###Particularly the Pennines . ###But erm , it 's , it 's terrifying , and when we get , as and Jack 's made a good point and , and it is a good one , that perhaps if we spent only half a day when somebody joins the depot and said to them , this is the geography of our depot , and this is where everywhere is , and this is how you get from one side of it to the other . 
301633:247	###It 's the targets , you do n't want to be in a position where you ca n't pick and choose . ###Exactly and once you get that appointment on the phone that you wanted , erm , they 'll look at the day , you 'll take it regardless . 
301677:63	###Sit down and they , they swear to me when they 're talking to me and what have you , you know , but we can go into them without appointments , you know , we can work them in between . ###yes , that 's right . 
301718:42	###Hey , I wonder if that call 's come through ? ###And so on , and all these things happen . 
301740:34	###You 're doing something else . ###Now it happens all the time , and there is absolutely no way at all with the best will in the world , and I 'm sure that we all mean it , that we get on the phones at nine o' clock , and we get on the phones at eleven o' clock , you just do n't work like that . 
301803:12	###It delivers parcels ###It delivers parcels and guarantees overnight . 
301848:8	###Oh ###you see . 
301848:64	###Oh ###you see . 
301888:9	###but it does n't , that does n't mean to say that these associations you know are n't there and that we we should n't would be wrong to point them out . ###I think we are quite justified in pointing it out . 
302044:84	###All got that as a phrase the political subtext . ###and it it crops up at various different stages through the play as well , it 's not just erm , you know 
302063:17	###Alright . ###O K so carry on then . 
302203:10	###No , that 's another strange thing . ###Erm , I think that was gay and 
302228:47	###That it 's fun yes . ###To their heart 's content . 
302408:7	###A across the sexes and B amongst themselves and here George goes on . ###One of the things I do not know about them , that 's women , is what they talk about and why the men are talking . 
302460:12	###No stars . ###Erm so you think it 's in the countryside anyway ? 
302461:14	###Erm so you think it 's in the countryside anyway ? ###It does n't have to be . 
302461:36	###Erm so you think it 's in the countryside anyway ? ###It does n't have to be . 
302463:17	###It does n't have to be , why does n't it have to be ? ###Go on , you might be right , go on . 
302476:12	###Yeah . ###Yes . 
302477:13	###Yes . ###It does n't have to be . 
302477:44	###Yes . ###It does n't have to be . 
302478:9	###It does n't have to be . ###It does n't have to be a fox out there , it does n't have to be a forest . 
302488:96	###Good , you 're getting on to good ideas now . ###Erm , in fact Ted Hughes I think has largely lived in the countryside so it is quite likely that his house in which he sets this poem is in the countryside . 
302488:121	###Good , you 're getting on to good ideas now . ###Erm , in fact Ted Hughes I think has largely lived in the countryside so it is quite likely that his house in which he sets this poem is in the countryside . 
302552:14	###Erm , Martin says it 's a real fox out there . ###Well it could be a real fox , when in fact if there is a forest out of his window at all , 
302570:65	###Squirrels , erm so we ca n't see any of those things but we can imagine them , ca n't we ? ###You can imagine the squirrels running up and down the trees without seeing them , so something else is alive . 
302661:10	###He 's making you a visual image of the fox , is n't he ? ###Only in the end it is n't an ordinary fox , it 's a thought fox . 
302798:24	###Erm the shadow . ###Shadow of the body . 
302798:37	###Erm the shadow . ###Shadow of the body . 
302916:44	###Yes . ###It 's not deliberate though is it ? 
303045:16	###mention that . ###Well I think not so much about when Hastings was there . 
303100:15	###Yes and at the end of the play as well . ###Yeah . 
303229:35	###Yeah . ###Erm so if they this kind of erm poking fun at previous acquired affection . 
303352:27	###So we 're looking to there are n't we only relate to inferior women . ###Er is that truthful do you think human nature . 
303484:32	###. Whoops I 'll put that on the Somebody left a highlighter in my office on Friday , a yellow one ? ###No ? 
303490:7	###Happy ? ###Oh God , it 's appalling written , which one ? 
303540:75	###Now I 'm not gonna bother to put the N sort of equals one to N equals N or something on the top yeah ? ###What it means is that we 're just adding up all the products for all the paired scores , right ? 
303548:17	###The answer will be N minus one where N is the number of paired scores , so the maximum value that that can obtain is N minus one . ###Now , there 's a proof for that and I 'll give it to you but but you 're not expected to know it , but it 's there for those of you who want it . 
303562:45	###We substitute those into the Z scores and lo and behold , at the bottom of the page , you end up with the maximum value of those of the product of X Y , sorry Z X and Z Y is N minus one . ###Now that 's if they 're positively correlated . 
303593:57	###I suggest you use this version because it 's one of the easier ones to calculate . ###They all end up the same way but you do it by different ways . 
303614:15	###Approximately that now I 've it 's very y' know woolly , most people do n't bother but you should really do the scatter plot to see whether a relationship is linear as opposed to something like that which would be curvier linear . ###it 's a repeated measures design . 
303652:64	###Did you get a copy of the , , that 's what , I do n't know what 's gonna happen with that because nobody 's got back in touch with me at all ###Oh right but is I went to t I said to them , d' you wanna scrap it yeah ? 
303653:47	###Oh right but is I went to t I said to them , d' you wanna scrap it yeah ? ###I said there 's y' know it was a couple of minutes late and they said erm it had to be processed through the proper channels . 
303657:17	###It was a waste . ###I just went over there and said it was okay , th I 'd put in a letter and they still could n't just take it off . 
303657:46	###It was a waste . ###I just went over there and said it was okay , th I 'd put in a letter and they still could n't just take it off . 
303665:23	###Apparently last week there was a course work deadline , I did n't realise . ###Erm Schumann psychology first years erm , that you is n't it , H P one ? 
303689:87	###Maitlin erm you 'll notice that it concentrates on spatial frequencies which is a particular interpretation of the type studies where you look at the responses of the brain to particular stimuli . ###Now , as I said in one of the quotes that we were talking about , a psychological explanation does not need to rest on physiological causes . 
303745:18	###For example , if we take those words there , I I hope that most of you can work out that that says , the cat , right , some of you can be difficult and say that you ca n't but I should think that most of you can . ###But if you look at the H and the A 's , they 're in fact , feature-wise , identical but you 're able to work out that one 's er an H and one 's an E based on the context . 
303751:191	###When you look at certain letters , you can see that they 've got exactly the same features involved in them . ###Take the B P and D. You often see that the P 's , the D 's du du and the B 's share similar features . 
303754:23	###Another thing , when you look at how people recognise characters , it 's not a the features that they pay attention to , but the overall shape . ###Quite often when you 're looking at people 's handwriting , you can tell by the overall shape rather than the single features . 
303754:106	###Another thing , when you look at how people recognise characters , it 's not a the features that they pay attention to , but the overall shape . ###Quite often when you 're looking at people 's handwriting , you can tell by the overall shape rather than the single features . 
303761:32	###The next topic we 're moving on to in a way w is is erm speaking in terms of time , precedes the work of the feature analysis , the feature analysists . ###Erm it dates back to the twenties , perhaps a bit earlier than that . 
303761:57	###The next topic we 're moving on to in a way w is is erm speaking in terms of time , precedes the work of the feature analysis , the feature analysists . ###Erm it dates back to the twenties , perhaps a bit earlier than that . 
303841:93	###It really gets over . ###Percepts I think are sort of breaking things into their sort of components if you like . 
303841:99	###It really gets over . ###Percepts I think are sort of breaking things into their sort of components if you like . 
303867:20	###He did a load of different experiments , this is just an example of one of them . ###They 're all very similar He , or they , manipulated the notion that similarity , they manipulated proximity by varying the distance between the two brackets , the two pair of brackets . 
303910:24	###I 'm not sure which one is better to present to you first . ###Ah computational modelling is easier for me to present to you but then the role of context might become more important so you can appreciate it , in which case I shall give you that first . 
304141:42	###Okay , so that 's the kind of basic idea . ###Okay , in terms of communication . 
304177:14	###Issues about time are quite interesting also . ###Er , if you look at status and length of time you get kept waiting , then the length of time you get kept waiting reflects the status differential between you and the person you 're waiting on , okay ? 
304199:55	###If you 're at all interested in that area then I have got you a reference I can give you to hand but it 's but a great deal of er architecture , certainly the thirties , forties , fifties reflected corporate status , corporate identity . ###Erm if you look at er the kind of erm soviet er architecture of the thirties and you can relate that quite nicely to a kind of American corporate architecture in the fifties designed to project certain sort of things . 
304243:24	###You would still ha be able to have some kind of interaction but it would n't actually be verbal because there would be no words in common , okay ? ###If I give you an example . 
304243:45	###You would still ha be able to have some kind of interaction but it would n't actually be verbal because there would be no words in common , okay ? ###If I give you an example . 
304267:7	###Well we 've got gesture ###Yeah , gesture , right What else ? 
304276:63	###Erm smell 's an interesting one . ###Smell tends does n't seem to be that relevant . 
304468:51	###. Now , it 's gonna I 've probably already said this to you . ###This will be ok the exam or paper will consist of six questions which you will do in two hours , er not all six of course . 
304472:42	###Now , two of the questions out of the six will come from developmental and four of the questions of the six will be coming from the topics that I 've covered on most of s it 'll come from one one of the many topics that I 've c or several of the topics that I 've covered . ###Now , the paper format has n't quite been decided with reference to whether it will be compulsory to do at least one from each section . 
304475:54	###Er it may be that you can do three from my stuff , it may be that you can do two from developmental and one from mine . ###They 're the two extremes . 
304600:123	###Do n't for God 's sake , do that y' know it 's what I find is , once panic sets in w and that 's usually either the night before or the day , I d anything that I try and read does n't really go in very well . ###You 're better off , you 're much , and do n't stay up late . 
304603:55	###And then , for the first time ever in my life , I what I normally do is I have sort of maybe some questions that I definitely pre-plan and if I 'm lucky one or two of them , and this paper all three of my prepared questions actually came up exactly as I 'd worded them , or near enough . ###And I looked , I wrote the first one , first class answer and I thought , this is a doddle , and I 'd done three days then or two nights without kip , and I sort of and erm suddenly I f and I went Smith nineteen forty ? 
304652:12	###If it ever does . ###Just talk about examples of your everyday life that sort of illustrate in some ways some aspect of the question . 
304679:46	###Questions about the exam ? ###Right ? 
304690:19	###Usually what critical evaluation would mean , for example , is to erm actually compare erm the model or the theory with what happen in practice . ###Compare it with other theories , try and look for the limitations of it . 
304736:69	###Who was there of course ? ###If you did n't bother turning up and reading it then that was no p 
304751:121	###So wh I mean it 's all to do with behaviourism in the sense that , rather than being concerned with the mechanisms that iner er what 's the word ? ###Mediate behaviour that go on inside the head . 
304786:18	###My spelling is awful by the way so the chances are I wo n't spot any spelling mistakes , yeah ? ###So do n't worry about spelling o Any other questions ? 
304802:26	###Do n't forget if you , have written any essays for anything else , as course work ? ###Okay , erm the quality of exam I mean there 'll be some people here who will feel embarrassed to have submitted the work that they 've written , right ? 
304830:77	###I think it begins , is it A E I ? ###No , it 's it 's erm it 's somebody who , all they do is write your answers for you but dictated I m if you 've ever been an em especially I mean I used to be I usually end up doing the amanuensing for courses that I 've taught on students on my paper . 
304840:14	###Okay , overheads are boring . ###Would you go with that ? 
304986:13	###Brilliant . ###Students are n't in on that Monday . 
304996:46	###There have been other examples used , though not many that are n't historical , but there have been , for instance , there was an account of a road accident , I 'll give most of these to you as exercises . ###An account of a road accident written by someone who 's learning English , and had a very limited vocabulary on it . 
304998:55	###Erm , so the editorial task each each time is exactly the same , you had to rewrite the extract in modern standard English , and then comment on any differences , and explain why those differences occurred , but they are quite often , erm , eighteenth or nineteenth century extracts from books , descriptions of things , erm , dialect , descriptions of of events , and things like that , and last year 's one , on , the one of last year 's paper was er , a middle English one . ###It was a letter written by er erm , a sixteenth century woman to her husband , and again it had commenting on the language used . 
305134:14	###Then I , I think that the next sentence is actually the hardest one in literal terms , but , word for word is easy enough . ###Erm , Sam , could you try that , the last sentence . 
305186:18	###Erm , and it means to , standing up against , erm , rejecting , oh no , I do n't think rejecting is is ###But , but I mean I suppose if we take sense of standing up against , it 's saying , and it stands up against , and it withstands against many sicknesses and evils and inserted into the middle of that , and succoureth it by virtue , so it helps by its goodness to withstand sicknesses and evils . 
305187:25	###But , but I mean I suppose if we take sense of standing up against , it 's saying , and it stands up against , and it withstands against many sicknesses and evils and inserted into the middle of that , and succoureth it by virtue , so it helps by its goodness to withstand sicknesses and evils . ###So the process that you have to carry out , then is to find a way of transferring your literal translation once you 've worked out word for word what is being said , into terms which mean something to a modern reader or , listener . 
305190:146	###So , you 're , you 're trying to find something which is in the language of the modern speaker . ###But also which reflects the style of the original , and that means the for instance in the second sentence , no , third sentence , for by fairness they feed the sight and pleaseth the smell by odour and touch by self han , by soft handling . 
305190:191	###So , you 're , you 're trying to find something which is in the language of the modern speaker . ###But also which reflects the style of the original , and that means the for instance in the second sentence , no , third sentence , for by fairness they feed the sight and pleaseth the smell by odour and touch by self han , by soft handling . 
305430:43	###Right ###I 'd like to know 
305436:12	###Idiomatic means , in , wi with a sort of , with phrasing , with word ordering , with a choice of vocabulary which is immediately recognised what as modern English , but if this thing is written in a formal style then , it is fair enough , that the modern idiomatic version will also be very formal . ###Idiomatic does n't mean colloquial . 
305437:40	###Idiomatic does n't mean colloquial . ###It does n't have to be in every day speech patterns . 
305654:12	###What . ###You always know when Paul does a version , it 's going to be his own version . 
305654:30	###What . ###You always know when Paul does a version , it 's going to be his own version . 
305672:8	###I think in relation to the fact that we were talk , that the earliest earlier thinkers about the water running off the earth . ###I do n't think you could assume that they evaporated . 
305685:73	###Sorry ? ###Nothing . 
305819:23	###none that would make any difference at this stage for selling it . ###Yeah . 
305871:59	###make no difference at this stage , the only thing is , if you say , if you 're buying a house now , you 'll need a Mortgage Master , ###Yes . 
305935:73	###Whether we actually sell it or not is irrelevant , it 's the fact that it might just be the hook to get inside someone 's house . ###Mm . 
305962:29	###Yeah , if your self-employed , then do n't forget there 's tax as well , ###That 's right , yeah , the tax . 
305966:24	###Our income . ###Income . 
305968:21	###So from your income , that we must have , says we can do all those things , and have our standard of living . ###So the question Mr client is , what happens if that disappears ? 
306155:7	###Yeah . ###The friendly doctor . 
306263:49	###Okay , imagine she 's effectively not earning a tangible income . ###Mm . 
306342:121	###Okay . ###They 'd only normally be happy to do that , if they did n't have the policy in the first place , would n't they . 
306349:14	###ah right . ###Moving swiftly on . 
306350:16	###Moving swiftly on . ###Housewives definition she must be confined to her home , or that of a recognised medical institution . 
306405:15	###Yeah . ###But I mean , your looking at a twenty , thirty year old now , who says I 'm gonna be packing up when I 'm fifty . 
306652:40	###Group four ###cannot have four week deferred period So what we 're saying is the risk there is too high , and there 's obviously a greater chance they 'll be claiming at a very early stage Okay , so the client has the choice , say , apart from the group fours , they could be four thirty and twenty-six and fifty-two , but again dove-tailing into what they 've already got . 
306698:9	###we can then start the deferred period . ###cos it could be a case of , you know , waiting twenty-six weeks to tell us , then we might say right , we now start the twenty-six weeks deferred . 
306748:14	###It 's got to be the same , or related so if it 's something new , then it will be a whole new claim . ###But if it 's the same or related condition , we 're saying , it 's a continuation of the claim , rather than stop and start again . 
307039:23	###Seventeen two-fifty . ###Seventeen two-fifty . 
307040:20	###Seventeen two-fifty . ###That 's the first equation , you must it this way , cos any other way will not be accurate . 
307055:37	###I 've gone dizzy . ###So that 's er , no plan will commence with more than fifty thousand Okay , what we 've now got to take off from these two figures is if there any other permanent health insurance benefits the client 's got with any other insurance companies . 
307064:12	###Yeah . ###Okay . 
307083:176	###Yes . ###erm , but in that situation , erm , so I understand , yo you 'd actually erm , 
307184:7	###No . ###Have you seen the Graham Taylor documentary ? 
307248:48	###Hopeless , or rubbish as to put it , yeah . ###Who would really , who would really mind . 
307248:56	###Hopeless , or rubbish as to put it , yeah . ###Who would really , who would really mind . 
307253:9	###We 've got to do , how they started , whatever . ###You ca n't just leave it open at the end . 
307295:19	###I know . ###they 're bound to differ . 
307435:27	###okay ###We did say , that that if possible we should n't be , actually in it . 
307498:9	###But even then , I mean , if he wants to be the interviewer . ###ca n't just like , putting people off . 
307519:53	###So I mean , I 'm not gonna point the questions at anyone in particular , I 'm just like have them answered , but I might just say to is this normal for her to be late . ###Now one of them will pipe up , yeah , she bloody always late . 
307805:46	###okay . ###Hannah ? 
307897:36	###biology . ###And an answer has come up , with no , because they would n't let me do biology , you see . 
307925:110	###Well , in case . ###But they did n't say they did n't ever want to ever drive a car again . 
307935:31	###But you 're taking English lessons so as you can go and get a degree in sociology or physiotherapy ###doing A Levels , okay . 
307959:7	###Yeah , yeah , they learn their basic moves on corpses , so it does n't do any harm . ###Just as you learn you learn your basic modes of essay writing in essays that I 'm not going mark for A Level exams , okay , erm , but there is another way . 
307988:9	###Very difficult . ###Time commitment . 
308031:64	###Right ? ###Mm . 
308215:7	###It 's Miss Letters is the best one , erm , The New People , Summer Picnic . ###How did you get to work though , did you just like . 
308282:55	###Think about it , though , do n't just blindly put them on any word that ends in s , make sure you know why you 're putting it there . ###Okay . 
308380:9	###Mallards , then . ###Yes , we 'll have one on mallards , between the d and the s . 
308889:68	###Er well the pension planning ###Why was that ? 
308927:8	###Okay , thanks for that . ###Maybe erm 
308975:79	###Now earlier this evening you mentioned Chris who you er play squash with and what I 'd ###Yeah . 
308976:27	###Yeah . ###you to do is er give me his telephone number so that I er contact him , offer the same service to him as I have to you . 
309473:116	###The county council Cambridge and district council , could Friends of the Earth . ###This committee working party with a small budget has nonetheless through sharing funding with these other agencies has had it prum pump climbing achievement of er creating a very successful project throughout the city over a number of years . 
309474:20	###This committee working party with a small budget has nonetheless through sharing funding with these other agencies has had it prum pump climbing achievement of er creating a very successful project throughout the city over a number of years . ###Does she agree that this non-controversial form has a er essential role to continue er in Cambridge and that erm the the issues of safety , environment and the promotion of low cost schemes is something that must be preserved ? 
309485:10	###We can now go to the second choice question . ###First of all councillor is lucky enough to get two bites at his cherry . 
309489:129	###And it did bring it home to me that we have got a major security problem in this building and in our other municipal buildings and quite frankly the ease with which anybody can come into this building at virtually any time of the day or evening astounds me . ###When I go to other er council buildings er throughout the area they 've all got these little er digital locks and people have got cards to get in and out with . 
309662:47	###Mr Mayor I think we , we owe a debt of gratitude to councillor this evening because the sort of motions he 's been putting forward has effectively united the progressive forces . ###And made one I think realise yet again why one is in politics and what it is that we you know , on progressive winger politics actually stand for . 
309666:10	###When that happens then the , some of the most effective voices on behalf of the state system will be silent , they 'll have no interest in preserving the best features of the state education system . ###The same is true of the health service , the more the private health educa the pri private health welfare comes in , the less chance there is of people who are , who are articulate and people who count in British society start speaking up with the rest of us and saying come on we we 've got a common interest and a common stake in this service and we want the best po for for everybody and the same will start happening in housing if you get your way . 
309669:7	###Erm , councillor ###There I was , talking to people asleep this morning and I woke to the dulcet tones of talking on the radio . 
309696:16	###To conclude I think that we should go along rather than hope sort of an aspect of Conservative philosophy which is that people should be encouraged to earn money and they should be encouraged to save money and that therefore in this case this means proposing this Conservative motion , though I hope they will actually have the common sense to withdraw it . ###Erm councillor 
309700:35	###That , and we 've had this in the past , where I would say that people that live in Yarbury North and South probably do earn less and live in houses that probably are , do n't have as big gardens and things like that , so the natu the nature of the is that they probably do earn less money erm but I I do n't consider those to be ghettos at all . ###And so I I they 're not agree with you so this surely is n't a situation that has arisen or will arise . 
309720:12	###Councillor debt . ###Thank you very much I think er councillor said that in er Tory erm motions goes against er Conservative er national policy but what it does identify is a very worrying sub text to the Tory policies of the moment because w means testing for hou for housing welfare has gone back to the worst aspects of the nineteen thirties politics basically . 
309742:7	###At least he got one thing right ###Thank you Mr Mayor . 
309743:76	###Thank you Mr Mayor . ###I must say one thing . 
309760:45	###What does n't change so fast is housing need . ###If your living with your in-laws and you 're having a baby and you want a house or if you have a baby and then you have another baby and you 're still living with your in-laws housing need has n't changed it just grows . 
309767:71	###In any event , I think I put this to you financial status , okay , so you 've got a job and you 've got er er a reasonable income , what financial status straightforward thing that financial status does n't say what your outgoings are . ###You might be divorced and have all of family to keep . 
309767:141	###In any event , I think I put this to you financial status , okay , so you 've got a job and you 've got er er a reasonable income , what financial status straightforward thing that financial status does n't say what your outgoings are . ###You might be divorced and have all of family to keep . 
309800:13	###Thirty nine against , thank you very much . ###Sixteen councillors , I take it that you . 
309868:13	###I would suggest er I wha , I have three suggestions or two suggestions to make . ###You could I I er it seems to me that body that you should go to with this is the joint sub . 
309896:156	###I 'm feel that it is the remit of this council , or indeed other district councils to talk about the whole of the county of Cambridgeshire , particularly when they start mucking around with issues well outside their own geographical area . ###I can see that perhaps if they want to have a er they may feel they need to stray into other boundaries but I did feel that when I read what Huntingdon district council proposed which was if you like , to completely re-drawing the electoral map for the entire county I was n't actually looking at something that was designed to deal with the interests of the citizens of Huntingdon district council , I was looking at the straightforward political proposal which would be far better to come from a political party than from a district council . 
309899:54	###The amendment which has gone up there and which I think is being circulated is our amendment which is designed to achieve spending at the government target figure . ###Now , despite what er councillor said in the paper the other day , there are no real surprises in this , no rabbits to come out of our hats . 
309913:70	###Everybody I thought , accepted that in committee , I ca n't remember what the liberal democrats did but certainly we did and certainly all the members of the labour group . ###So I ca n't see any reason er for putting that back but obviously we 've . 
309916:75	###The labour group have now agreed to reduce it to a hundred thousand . ###I see no reason whatsoever for a council that will still have two and a half million pounds in balances after the labour group proposals , why on earth we need to build another hundred thousand pounds into the budget , paid for by er council tax payers to provide for unforeseen expenditure . 
309943:53	###What a waste of time , we all know that the county council is the the highway authority and is fully responsible for traffic management , we 're in a minority and to set up a working party is a complete waste of time . . ###Information technology costs , councillor said , do n't worry we 've already saved a hundred and fifty thousand pounds in the last year . 
309949:55	###Let 's face it , it 's the largest amount we spend in this council , is money spent on our employees . ###The balance of this er well the community groups we do n't feel it 's right to spend that money at this point in time until we 've sorted out er where the other four hundred odd thousand pounds is actually going in that budget before we start throwing even more money . 
309976:46	###Some of our , some of our er community centres are in fact run by volunteers , some of them are run , er most of them in fact have a very large substantial volunteer input . ###But when you have a community centre like street that is which a joint you can see the value of of of maintaining it as a a paid for as a a a erm and be substantial volunteer input that exists . 
309985:158	###I 've got councillor ###Erm thank you Mr Mayor , erm I 'm taking up to speak about the community arts . 
310059:24	###The second point is that of course as we accept into the role of opposition indeed to give these alternative proposals , give this particulary case to come within the government guidelines . ###But I think of course we can all debate er the various individual proposals and I think if we were in control of the council not only of course would we have different policies but the sort of detailed matters which would come up in debate would be discussed in committee , things would be in the normal way . 
310077:50	###We 're not trying to say to people , the information is there come in and get it , we 're actually trying to present it to them . ###Whether they 're the citizens ' charter , whether they are response to people from the press or from the public or constantly ringing in to the switchboard , or whether it 's by all the other ways in which we disseminate information . 
310108:15	###As with all financial decisions Mr Mayor , this one comes down to a matter o a question of priority . ###This group places extremely high priority on the abatement of noise pollution and I hope it 's something we can all support . 
310131:30	###Here , here . ###Councillor . 
310141:15	###Councillor I second it . ###Thank you erm , I 'd just like to digress slightly to start off with . 
310146:90	###The re the reason I bring this up , the reason I bring this up , you 've supported that in the past you know , they 've said , those in the you would agree with that , so the reason I bring this up is that if you we start off by offering a full service across the whole week . ###Then what happens is we say well we do n't need the service of noise abatement Monday , Tuesday , Wednesdays erm so what we 'll do is we will concentrate on Thursday , Friday , Saturday . 
310163:55	###I was quite surprised to see he was wide eyed and quite awake when when he came to my flat . ###But the point is . 
310167:44	###Thank you . ###councillor . 
310168:55	###councillor . ###Mr Mayor , I do feel after councillor er er er speech I just have to make a little comment erm people in my ward . 
310172:66	###Do these cars parking across driveways have horns blowing ? ###I do detect a certain er levity here I would point out that it is now twenty five past nine and we still have n't this afternoon 's business . 
310173:51	###I do detect a certain er levity here I would point out that it is now twenty five past nine and we still have n't this afternoon 's business . ###There is a lot left to do so can we please er try and stick to the point I have to chair right to respond should he so chose , but not about the cars in Stretton Avenue . 
310182:9	###Those who would wish to take it in parts please show those against taking it in parts this evening we will vote on it as one amendment in that case . ###Those in favour of the amendment please show those against the amendment please show thank you . 
310202:190	###Okay we a major cause of some five hundred thousand pounds and we give addition to the three point six five one million which has been identified in this amendment . ###And it would be helpful for councillor I would say that I know that there are a third of our members and from the program committees for capital expenditure which I suspect is going to be to excess of the five hundred thousand pounds per year which we actually have . 
310203:64	###And it would be helpful for councillor I would say that I know that there are a third of our members and from the program committees for capital expenditure which I suspect is going to be to excess of the five hundred thousand pounds per year which we actually have . ###Now that will need to be assessed by the council as a whole against it 's priorities with regard to the balancing of the use of capital against capital to prop up the revenue er expenditure of the council and conceivably er to deal with the problems arising er out of government er legislation and clearly we are going to have to make some decisions decisions about this . 
310250:103	###It abhors me , it hurts me . ###Ah 
310254:32	###Our rent levels have always been in line in the case of tenants guidelines and I of course there were savings that about is insufficient in in in areas . ###Erm , in we were not sitting here at the end of our , how many years is it now , thirteen , fourteen years . 
310254:60	###Our rent levels have always been in line in the case of tenants guidelines and I of course there were savings that about is insufficient in in in areas . ###Erm , in we were not sitting here at the end of our , how many years is it now , thirteen , fourteen years . 
310277:180	###Ooh . ###It puts forward a spurious long term disadvantages as reasons why we should ignore the short term benefits offered to us up to the end of this calendar year . 
310336:46	###You are reminded that members are limited to two minutes in asking their questions . ###Chairs similarly limited to two minutes in their reply . 
310355:7	###I think it 's er , I think it covers the largest area for any er one association and er y' know it 's g very pleased about that , erm I am aware of your er meeting and I think it it 's obvious that all new residents association will identify erm a lot of things which need doing er when they 're first formed . ###And I think they 're actually picking out a particular area for a report is is not necessarily good practice. , erm I think we can identify er those areas piece by piece we will go through them , they can be brought forward to a variety of areas . 
310363:83	###Thank you Mr Mayor . ###I think we all recognise that traffic issues here in Cambridge are likely to be controversial issues and I think we 'd all equally recognise that er the joint traffic management sub- committee has made considerable progress in recent years in the provision of cycle lanes for example , in dealing with illegal parking er on the city 's road and in improving the environment for pedestrians in our main shopping streets . 
310372:36	###councillor to the councillor . ###Erm , well my question about the break-in at the Kingsway flats launderette , erm in the launderette the facilities are controlled by a vending machine built into the wall . 
310406:44	###But Don apparently took his ###Right . 
310474:31	###With so many visiting stewards all the time we have n't got a regular pattern of of any stewards that 's going to be responsible . ###A absolutely . 
310476:7	###So it 's it 's all in all must be done by staff . ###Yeah yeah yeah . 
310478:12	###It must be . ###You cannot rely on stewards because you know they 're they 're not here all the time . 
310482:42	###as opposed to an individual , because our staff is switching round all the time ###Yeah . 
310558:40	###But now that we 've changed the thing we 've got to this is something we 've got to add into it ###Yeah . 
310784:31	###Well ###problem with them . 
310805:30	###Erm can you push him up on the standard bearings ? ###Very doubtful . 
310823:20	###Yeah . ###John was just running it for me now so I 'll pick it up on the way home tonight . 
310830:12	###Right . ###Yeah ? 
310888:19	###is no longer valid . ###Right . 
310904:75	###Erm but er I have the problem with trying to balance up which way to go . ###I mean obviously I 'd like to sell it all at price levels but there 's get away with that . 
310904:156	###Erm but er I have the problem with trying to balance up which way to go . ###I mean obviously I 'd like to sell it all at price levels but there 's get away with that .

311847:41	###And that applies to twenty fives and obviously pre-packs . ###Er before I went off , we were talking about packaging , have we decided to bring any in yet ? 
311863:15	###Well s well erm Pete said originally , at the end of the month but it looks like , with this problem , it 's gonna be phasi If we can get some off-site at the end of the month . ###It does n't matter though does it if we overflow ? 
311962:9	###They loaded I think one and two thirds . ###Yeah . 
312073:9	###Well he keeps telling me that he keeps saying . ###Well can we not buy it see where stocks lie . 
312119:65	###Well Arthur wants the sealer anyway because if you 're not doing over there , you 'll have double shift working on pre-packs . ###So it still wants 
312199:48	###And and Chris has just put his head in his hands and said I ca n't do it . ###Mm . 
312324:65	###Oh no I have n't . ###So they got paid their own rate . 
312375:29	###Like hell you will . ###I 've had bloody platforms put up there to make it a lot easier for people to get up there . 
312413:71	###Now the mix-up we had yesterday , er on a lot of aggro when I got about this dust extract system one line three . ###I do n't know whether people think they can move a dust extract in an hour or two hours . 
312465:5	###Brian 'd be under stress anyway having to move that er dust extractor quickly and he 's ###Well he got called away . 
312512:66	###I shudder to think . ###I mean yesterday was yesterday really was there was n't a deal of wind at all but bloody sandstorm 
312629:12	###When we get this list typed up that Joanne 's doing at the moment , ###Yeah . 
312683:25	###Cos used to tell ' em when it was gonna be and they would have time before the event to get it all tidied up , it was all ready , he would in and say , there 's such and such on that one , such and such on this one ###A four letter word Dick , time . 
312692:49	###Well yeah I mean bear in mind bear in mind you 've got a week 's notice to put one together . ###Mm . 
312716:7	###We wanted to split it into three , ###Mm . 
312735:10	###But I mean you know , we did n't have much . ###I 've got a lot in reserve , you 've got a 
312900:46	###I 've never seen it fully extended actually so I ###forty foot . 
313044:72	###No no they 're not gonna use it today . ###Well they 're not gonna be using it tomorrow when it gets there . 
313093:9	###Then when you asked me if you could have Bill for Thursday morning . ###We rearranged it . 
313099:29	###Well yes , see so Jack we did n't know that 's right , ###No it 's all been done . 
313108:26	###Is that gonna be is that gonna be a recurring problem ? ###Or has it been a build up over a ye number of years 
313299:76	###I 've got it down on my desk somewhere . ###The bill . 
313323:13	###I 've got them as well . ###You 've got a file of them . 
313445:12	###Yeah . ###Straight onto a pallet , palletize it , wrap it , forklift it , put it in , stack it three high . 
313470:10	###But you do n't do you hav wil will have you got to shrink wrap it at all or will it hold will it will it just sit right on the pallets without falling off ? ###shrink wrap it . 
313575:55	###seven guys . ###Yeah . 
313602:10	###On Friday w would it be a good idea Cos I do n't know what time the generator 's but I mean it would be really best if we could set things up . ###Would n't it on Friday . 
313694:65	###Yeah I mean there 's no comeback on us is there ? ###This lifter three pallets high lifting 
313779:12	###So we we well all I suggest is we get the three together after the meeting , John and our two men and say , well look , who 's done it and if they have n't , see the other man when he comes on . ###as far as the racking itself 's concerned has it erm affected the stability of the racking or has it just dented it I mean is do we need to do anything about it ? 
313780:12	###as far as the racking itself 's concerned has it erm affected the stability of the racking or has it just dented it I mean is do we need to do anything about it ? ###The beam 'll have to come out . 
313783:7	###And what we do n't know yet if the back beam 's alright . ###I I think the back beam 'll be alright . 
313808:61	###I said , no no we have n't got any scrap racking . ###But he put me in touch with a chap who was interested in buying it . 
313831:24	###Yes . ###Nothing to do with me . 
313853:9	###Because I could n't er i mean Chris was one minute he was on the phone , the next minute you could n't get hold of him . ###Yeah . 
313869:77	###Okay we had n't attempted reducing the nutrient ###thin ground I think you 're on dangerous grounds adjusting the formulations are n't you without 
313946:27	###What do we do with all this stuff that 's got excessively high conductivity , I mean is it being what 's happening to it ? ###Well nine times out of ten we re re-sample it and it 's allowed to go out . 
313948:43	###But there are occasions when we 've had to rip and tip but it 's causing a problem ###Most of it has been 
313949:14	###Most of it has been ###cos we 've got thirty five pallets down at street which then has to be 
314025:7	###We select the pallets then ###Do you ? 
314026:7	###Do you ? ###they must be uniform . 
314029:27	###We go to no end of trouble to ###D K I mean the fee 
314056:66	###He knows which way he 's going . ###Alright all I all I 'd ask is that would you erm just mention to him what I 've said and that if he believes after discussion with you that there are some pallets which are not in a fit state to send out , and they are gonna tip over on a lorry and dislodge , then they are rejected and Pete Pete knows about it and they are they are actually isolated and rewrapped . 
314069:18	###then it 's you know , the plant will do it . ###Oh no I we understand that . 
314075:7	###Now here it i this is what we do this is what it 's like , it 's fine , you 've got nothing to complain about . ###I could n't say that . 
314097:7	###But we are conscious of D K . ###Right . 
314450:18	###You have got some at Morton ? ###Yes . 
314460:86	###Well , they , they may be quality builders , Mr Chairman , but I 'm not sure that it happen , has any relevance to this discussion , we 're talking about a planning application . ###Oh yes , yes , but you just asked what benefit they thought they brought to the village . 
314782:10	###Well we will retain as many trees as we can . ###Yeah , but it 's impossible to retain them with two four bedroomed houses , now is n't it ? 
314835:15	###Is grass . ###Yes . 
314856:81	###Erm that 's putting it bluntly because erm obviously being a volunteer is a sort of two way thing , we could n't run without volunteers , we 're very grateful for the ones we 've got but So it 's clearly a matter of whether you decide and whether you like the way we like to run things or or not . ###And we 've had people quite often in these sessions eventually have said , well no I do n't I do n't think I will . 
314858:19	###Because er there 's too much , because they did n't like the way things were run , something like that and on occasions we have had to say to people , we 're sorry , we just do n't think you 're the right kind of person for us . ###So it it is a sort of selection process a sort of mutual selection process . 
314883:87	###We actually at long last , now the Winter 's nearly over , are having made for them some big heavy red cloaks for those who are standing on duty in the courtyard . ###Er not to costume them you understand but simply because a cloak is something that can be worn by a man or a woman and can be worn over whatever you have on . 
314926:49	###So in fact we dropped the alleyway in nineteen ninety one , that was the line of the alleyway , the horizontal line along along there . ###So in order to get back to the medieval level , we took it back down to there and we caused the to slope . 
315066:12	###Occasionally you 'll get people who do n't want to take at all . ###That 's true 
315111:81	###Mm . ###Now if somebody steals that it 's an awful nuisance but that 's all it is . 
315117:11	###Cos it 's so like the original and oh you ca n't really test er metal for date , well not without a lot of problems anyway . ###Now we do n't have any new things , I should have Thank you for asking the question because we 're trying to give the impression of a medieval house the what 's special about this is that it 's a medieval house as it looked when it was new . 
315118:41	###Now we do n't have any new things , I should have Thank you for asking the question because we 're trying to give the impression of a medieval house the what 's special about this is that it 's a medieval house as it looked when it was new . ###Since we had to renew so much of the timber , we thought we would turn that to good account , rather than trying to We do n't want it to look as if it 's five hundred years old . 
315191:27	###Every now and again , we run up against what you might call a medieval . ###Erm because of having to do everything as much as we can the medieval way , if we were ordinary people and we said we wanted to tile we 'd say , oh well we 'll go out and buy some tiles . 
315193:9	###But we ca n't do that because we have to make our tiles in the way that 's most . ###The reason being that when tiles are made , they 're made with clay in a big frame and then they 're cut with a thing like piano wire . 
315292:249	###Are the pegs attached to the tiles so they hang on the the lathes ? ###Yes the pegs the pegs go through the tiles so the tiles are are made with little square hole . 
315316:140	###They 're woven as you see on thirty six inch wide hand-looms . ###Just with a without a flying shuttle , passing the shuttle back and forth . 
315318:97	###They 're dyed also naturally in the medieval way with red for the madder and then welled to give the yellow as the basis of digris and then a woad an indigo from woad erm slightly cheating there because we could n't have enough woad , we have to use import the actual substance . ###So you dye it yellow and then you dye it blue and it goes that green . 
315338:44	###However if you go in there and there 's no one to disturb , I always look and make sure there is n't anyone first , and look at all the wall cupboards , the wall cupboards the wood has been cleaned , actually are about the largest collection of late medieval ironwork in England . ###Because all their hinges and c all their hinges and straps are all original and they all date from about fourteen ten . 
315348:84	###And we have n't tenterhooked this wall because we wanted to be able to open and shut this curtain so we 've adopted another medieval style taken from erm er medieval manuscripts . ###The rail is made of wrought iron and the rings are made of cast bronze . 
315348:111	###And we have n't tenterhooked this wall because we wanted to be able to open and shut this curtain so we 've adopted another medieval style taken from erm er medieval manuscripts . ###The rail is made of wrought iron and the rings are made of cast bronze . 
315354:57	###The reason why that 's been preserved is that that part of the wall was never bricked in . ###So that it was always able to breathe . 
315381:63	###He 's coming tonight to stay , to bring the benches which are gonna go on the outside here . ###Er the gentleman coming from Scotland on Saturday is bringing me all the table linen and we 're table linen for . 
315383:39	###Including these tremendously long towels which are er one and a half times the length of the table because they have to go over everybody 's lap as a napkin kind of communal napkin . ###Mhm . 
315389:9	###Everyone is going to be given er or lent er one of these er eating knives which we had specially made . ###And we 'll give them a fork and knife and I wo n't go into it in great detail but everything is going to be the six courses will be entirely accurately served on bread plates over on pewter trenchers . 
315410:23	###Smoke went out there . ###The original beam , black and that beam across there is the original beam which is blackened by all the smoke . 
315435:36	###Erm well I mean they did n't know it was there you see . ###Mm yeah . 
315450:25	###And and not really even a living room for the owners cos they were in the bed chamber . ###Mm . 
315536:127	###Otherwise we would n't have known what it looked like . ###Now we do . 
315536:134	###Otherwise we would n't have known what it looked like . ###Now we do . 
315543:25	###Probably with braziers we think as far as we know , although there is also a chimney breast there which is a later date . ###Although it may well cover something of an earlier date . 
315558:62	###You 're not required to know all that remember or indeed any of it because they have everything they need to know , particularly if they do the long tour , they have everything they need to know on the tour and everything they need to know about the furniture well pieces of furnitures . ###On the other hand you 'd be very odd people if you did n't take an interest in something in particular , some people take an interest in the w wooden frames , some take an interest in the textiles or some piece of furniture . 
315559:8	###On the other hand you 'd be very odd people if you did n't take an interest in something in particular , some people take an interest in the w wooden frames , some take an interest in the textiles or some piece of furniture . ###Some people I mean , Elsie loves cleaning things so she 's spends all her time waxing things cos has to be cleaned very carefully . 
315564:39	###. Erm so you 're not required to know all that , or any of it or much of it . ###Probably if you if you were to absorb the information in that guide book , that would be enough . 
315631:15	###Yeah but roofs used to get twisted did n't they ? ###Yes they do , it probably will twist a bit . 
315654:177	###Which is really the urgentest most urgent thing . ###Which I hope we may be able to in April because really they are a disgrace at the moment . 
315654:242	###Which is really the urgentest most urgent thing . ###Which I hope we may be able to in April because really they are a disgrace at the moment . 
315697:28	###And you have a plate per mess and you take as much as you want onto your trencher and your bowl . ###Like that . 
315715:7	###They have we 're having to employ a specially approved you see we 've got the Health and Safety . ###Oh yes . 
315720:10	###And that 's why that 's another reason why it 's all so expensive . ###Yeah . 
315739:10	###I 'm afraid not , you can imagine why not ca n't you . ###Yeah . 
315739:38	###I 'm afraid not , you can imagine why not ca n't you . ###Yeah . 
315834:49	###Usually after elections we have an upsurge in memberships , so this year , thanks mainly to Tom Hilton , er it 's been good that we 've managed to maintain our membership . ###The membership unfortunately have seemed rather passive . 
315843:7	###Perhaps we need to involve members in er other ways . ###I feel that we need now new blood on the committee , and coupled with the fact that I 've done one one more year than the constitution says I should , I 'm not standing for reelection as Chairman . 
315904:28	###Talking about the closing of mines . ###Yeah . 
315904:33	###Talking about the closing of mines . ###Yeah . 
315984:155	###That 's right . ###their their range . 
316077:14	###So at the moment it 's ninety six . ###If anybody can help me help me to get it up to three figures again personal contact could be er very useful in these cases if you come across anybody who you might think we could interest . 
316092:183	###Expenditures , er some of the the er higher amounts are printing at ninety pounds fifty , cons conference fees at sixty pounds , er Euro Election er donation of twenty five pounds , photocopies of forty pounds , er bank charges Which er was a point that I took up with the bank erm Mr Chairman last December . ###Er they wanted to charge us eighty pence per transaction , and after a lot of argument we managed to pin them down er at er ten pounds for the at at the rate of two pounds fifty per quarter . 
316095:78	###Mm . ###And that one pound sixty would be eroded erm in the amount that comes back on our erm direct payments from Downing Street . 
316115:16	###I 've had a package at long last er back from EARS er but I have n't actually erm put it onto the computer yet because it 's erm it 's proving a bit temperamental at the moment and I did n't want to risk overloading it with with yet another er software package u until I 've had it seen to . ###Er I suspect that what they 've sent us is the software but not the database for any wards and the the deal was that we would get er at least er the database for two wards er and a printout annotated with telephone numbers of the er electoral register . 
316120:87	###It 's a it 's a thing called EARS er which is an acronym for Starts with Election anyway . ###And what it enables you to do is er to to either type in the electoral register or er read it in from the corporation 's disks , er maybe after translation , which is what one of the jobs that EARS did for us , er and you can then tag it with erm er serv erm canvas er returns and telephone numbers and things like that . 
316156:12	###Memberships . ###Er well the Liberal Democrats or even S L D if you want . 
316165:44	###The the other factor is that ###we used to get . 
316321:115	###First of all nursery schools would be dealing with the County Council on a different basis from the vast of , of the schools population and that will give rise to anomalies and complications which would be undesirous and secondly there might be problems particularly if they are considering expanding nursery provision between nursery schools and nursery classes in primary schools . ###Both of these can be avoided by delegating nursery schools on a similar basis to the delegation which was made for ordinary schools and again you consulted about that and the proposal laid in this report . 
316365:8	###The third area I need to take you through is some erm typographical amendments to the resolutions that you have in front of you , so if you just bear with me I proposed to go through those and perhaps if you want to mark them on the sheets as I go through and if I 'm going too fast erm just wave . ###The first erm resolution sheet that you have in front of you is a pink one erm so the Labour group there are no typographical errors on the pink sheet . 
316401:10	###That does not change the fact that as far as parents are concerned if there is no nursery school or nursery class available to them then for them there is no provision at all and I know that you will want to address the question of whether you can find additional resources for nursery education er in the course of the debate . ###I would also I think put in a word for the work of the joint po policy panel erm which is shared between this committee and the social services committee because it seems to me that it is not for us to be thinking that there is a group of children for who nursery education is necessary er or desirable and a different group of children for whom something else erm is necessary and desirable , largely because of their parents ' position . 
316414:77	###I think I told you some months ago that I would be asking you to consider that ###in the course of your budget debate and er true to form I 've brought it in front of you this morning . 
316507:38	###Well the growth area section in ten , part of that is again , again , maintaining this level of service , er so if I move on to er the savings under paragraph nine , bottom of the pink sheet . ###I 'm going to say a word about the efficiency savings on school meals and the proposal from the Conservatives bringing this alternative meal system . 
316513:41	###my daughter , who 's sixteen and also her school mates and she said , well where 's the beef burgers ? ###where 's the beef ? so , so I 'm dubious about this in terms of quality of nutrition , in terms of choice being offered and I think we need to look a lot more closely at this before we jump into agreement , change or in the system . 
316567:18	###And now we call upon er Paul to present the er Liberal Democrat er . ###Yes , thank you Chairman , I hope to be slightly er more brief erm , in proposal of the Liberal Democrat budget of er , er three , six O point six million which I would remind with your permission is the er the minimum target er , er suggested by , by . 
316570:22	###I would like to extend my thanks also to the officers who have worked er very , very hard er both sides of the Christmas . ###Erm I have thought that the same is listed in paragraph seven er and the growth of paragraph eight were non , non-controversial and er would have received all party support but I . 
316570:222	###I would like to extend my thanks also to the officers who have worked er very , very hard er both sides of the Christmas . ###Erm I have thought that the same is listed in paragraph seven er and the growth of paragraph eight were non , non-controversial and er would have received all party support but I . 
316573:24	###erm and while we 're talking about er , er ###Conservatives , this government has perpetrated some dastardly things 
316576:42	###Here , here , here . ###Not because they granted its continued necessity , your sanction will continue providing someone else pays . 
316583:130	###Er so with these three measures plus the seven hundred and one thousand estimate er underspent th this year to carry forward , we have er about a million and a half to use against er further grant and of the options listed in section ten er , ours are not dissimilar from the , er from and I best pick the ###erm we have , we , the Liberal Democrats have made no secrets in , of the fact , locally and nationally that er within the nursery places are our top educational priority . 
316592:140	###Er I assure you there 's been no conclusion on this and I am sure will agree with me ###here , here 
316592:166	###Er I assure you there 's been no conclusion on this and I am sure will agree with me ###here , here 
316593:12	###here , here ###erm the rest of arbitrary proposals maybe considered small comparison in , in financial terms at least but er differ a little if any in , in educational value , that 's two hundred thousand to boost the fourteen and nineteen strategy , er I think there must in the present climate in which we have to regard the vocational content of education as well as the academic . 
316594:53	###erm the rest of arbitrary proposals maybe considered small comparison in , in financial terms at least but er differ a little if any in , in educational value , that 's two hundred thousand to boost the fourteen and nineteen strategy , er I think there must in the present climate in which we have to regard the vocational content of education as well as the academic . ###Erm we must recognize 
316596:93	###that the , to cope with the expression on that there , that erm we , we must fund , fund this referral unit , erm coming last to capital , erm many of school buildings are in an abysmal and dilapidated position through neglect over many , many years before er , we 've given perhaps , erm , but our meagre a hundred and ninety thousand er I 've , I admit wo n't go very far . ###Er there and er it 's therefore er the best use we can make of it , not specifically for any particular school in any particular circumstances as I read in the , that the , that the Tories proposals have been in , on , on , on the issue . 
316615:59	###whether it 's nineteen ninety , ninety five which is relatively small , it widens to a potential sixteen point five million , fourteen point five million minimum , in ninety five , ninety six and to twenty seven point two million in ninety six , ninety seven . ###Even if those figures are reduced by the two million each year that leaves a very large financial mountain to climb in the years ahead and I apologise for beginning with that gloomy prognosis but it does get better , thanks to our proposals . 
316643:17	###Members of the committee will see that savings continue to come through on the school meals service and this is to a very considerable extent , the result that the ethos of the previous Conversative administration which ran a tight ship and positively encourage deficiency . ###A number of the savings in this report come into that category . 
316645:70	###I believe that we must look very closely into the alternative meal . ###It uses modern technology to provide an extremely cost effective meal and it 's substituted with fresh items every day . 
316705:87	###Frankly one of your a hundred and forty pounds because at a hundred and forty thousand pounds that is an insult ###that is three pence per child per week . 
316745:7	###Thank you , Mrs Pauline . ###Thank you Chairman , I appreciate that erm prudence is n't flavour of the month in the current majority at this County Council and that indeed has been proved by several speeches from the opposition parties that were made this morning 
316748:7	###In the other parties ###the other parties 
316753:12	###Following on from the last administration , the Conservative proposals and that it would enable something like four hundred and fifty extra nursery places to be provided . ###That follows on a steady increase in nursery provision over the last few years . 
316761:57	###The budgets of course proposed by the Liberal and Labour groups , have some aspects which would be desirable . ###The problem is as they know in their heart of hearts much of what they propose this year is not sustainable in future years . 
316781:53	###Okay then , erm six tanks erm reinforced concrete er two metres square by about two metres high with er on the top . ###Er basically we call this area and the area here we 've got er and for the actual set up . 
316782:79	###Er basically we call this area and the area here we 've got er and for the actual set up . ###Er the problem with the job is it 's very tight inside there so we 've had to use cranes and basically poured concrete er ours is being done by a separate sub-contractor . 
316783:7	###Er the problem with the job is it 's very tight inside there so we 've had to use cranes and basically poured concrete er ours is being done by a separate sub-contractor . ###Er few problems with the job before we started or during the job er , come back to us for a six so far so we have to What we will do is drop them down and Er another problem with the job is we 're about three week 's behind er arranged for them to come in on Monday . 
316797:10	###and the other was , which I do n't think you said ###Did you find that a particular problem ? 
316809:57	###Erm , good morning ladies and gentlemen . ###My name is Alan and this is Terry and we 're Group Two . 
316811:31	###We 're going to talk to you about er Farm project and its basic problems which we had to put a programme together and er make the job ###Erm you 've seen this before so 
316814:59	###Now we just have a couple of minor problems to start with . ###Here we go and that is that , up to now , erm we 've only made six beams , we 've got to reach , for these tanks , we want to make sixty and the problem is we 're on stop now redesign the whole thing and going on the present rate of production we 're going to go up to about week twenty-eight . 
316819:31	###That 's for the We actually calculated them by using the unit quantity ###Now , ow ! 
317015:64	###I 'd like to spend a few minutes now trying to pull that together and then go onto how we evaluate these plans , because you 've all produced these and would n't you like to know how good they are and how bad they are ? ###Can you tell how good they are and how bad they are ? 
317031:9	###Is that right ? ###I ca n't remember . 
317035:31	###Is that right ? ###No , you may have said , ah , I 've got room this to do , I 've got this base to do , this base formwork base , erm , thi this wall er reinforcement to do . 
317036:12	###No , you may have said , ah , I 've got room this to do , I 've got this base to do , this base formwork base , erm , thi this wall er reinforcement to do . ###So in , in both projects I think we had to do that first step . 
317038:12	###Er , we had to get the number of resources . ###If only I could spell resources , number of resources . 
317039:95	###If only I could spell resources , number of resources . ###Now , everybody had to do that . 
317040:57	###Now , everybody had to do that . ###Er , there you said I 'd got three formwork gangs or four formwork gangs six a gang er and here you said I 'd got so many so we had to do that . 
317045:57	###The questions are identical I think . ###They were just slightly different types of work which were being done . 
317045:70	###The questions are identical I think . ###They were just slightly different types of work which were being done . 
317045:88	###The questions are identical I think . ###They were just slightly different types of work which were being done . 
317048:33	###In this one it was n't quite so er , straightforward in that we , we had n't given you the actual activities to do . ###We 'd given you the activities to do there so you could find the output of them . 
317048:55	###In this one it was n't quite so er , straightforward in that we , we had n't given you the actual activities to do . ###We 'd given you the activities to do there so you could find the output of them .

317048:108	###In this one it was n't quite so er , straightforward in that we , we had n't given you the actual activities to do . ###We 'd given you the activities to do there so you could find the output of them . 
317050:9	###In this one we had n't told you that you had to strip formwork , that you had to er , make the formwork , that you had to fix the steel , you had to know this from your own knowledge . ###Yeah ? 
317050:49	###In this one we had n't told you that you had to strip formwork , that you had to er , make the formwork , that you had to fix the steel , you had to know this from your own knowledge . ###Yeah ? 
317050:84	###In this one we had n't told you that you had to strip formwork , that you had to er , make the formwork , that you had to fix the steel , you had to know this from your own knowledge . ###Yeah ?

317051:28	###Yeah ? ###So you had to know that in order to , to pour concrete you had to have something to pour it into and you had to put the erm you had to have er reinforcements as well . 
317052:7	###So you had to know that in order to , to pour concrete you had to have something to pour it into and you had to put the erm you had to have er reinforcements as well . ###Bu but basically the output rates were , you had to do . 
317062:9	###Is that correct ? ###Yeah ? 
317062:32	###Is that correct ? ###Yeah ? 
317062:79	###Is that correct ? ###Yeah ? 
317064:7	###So you had to choose that er , you have to do that and the fifth thing that I wrote down here which I had to do , a sequence er , of work . ###Now there are two sequences here I , I think erm in , in all these things . 
317090:14	###And I certainly think the results that you 've produced show that the , the problem is quite manageable because I think in the end you 've actually produced a very good programme for work . ###All of them ! 
317092:46	###Because you 've had to make different assumptions and you 've er decided different ways are different . ###But I think your , your thinking has gone along these lines which is fundamental to any planning programme . 
317093:23	###But I think your , your thinking has gone along these lines which is fundamental to any planning programme . ###Now when you 're out on site some of these things you have to do each week . 
317095:34	###Some of them you do n't have to do each week because they 're there from previous work on , on the site . ###So you would know the output rate , or you think you 'd know the output rates but you only know those output rates if somebody bothered to collect them ! 
317109:23	###And I think there 's a lot of goes on here . ###Er , in , in , in the real world where people say , you do it , it 's yours . 
317209:51	###I 'm not saying it is . ###Yes . 
317223:10	###Sorry ? ###Well I do n't know where . 
317324:55	###Yeah . ###Once again , you know , you 'd have thought in a green field construction site that you would n't get access problems and in er , a restricted area like a city centre building or er , a you would get access problems . 
317509:27	###So I 'm only interested in that . ###If I can get these , that 's great . 
317646:27	###Yeah . ###Yeah . 
317783:31	###Who 's responsible for raising documents in the despatch department . ###Or who 's responsible for erm received or going out . 
317800:31	###Is not to persuade them to change on that call . ###Is to gather information . 
317801:27	###Is to gather information . ###Alison I understand you 're the person who has to drive information on . 
317953:49	###Well I 'm not researcher I could n't say how they do it but it 's done it was done from their recruitment and marketing sales . ###And they put on every consultant through out training course they got I think we 've made I think we 've got sixty five . 
317961:24	###no no if you 're not careful . ###I wanna tell you the way the word perhaps the one where . 
318052:14	###That 's it you do want that 's all that 's all body language ###Does n't even speak 
318069:11	###Women are really expert at it . ###We 've got it . 
318107:10	###Now when you 're often they phone up and say , There 's someone here to see you . ###And . 
318110:9	###They get post land on their desk . ###But they have n't got the instant feedback . 
318123:7	###People get confused then they think , Oh when something I 've got to and I 've to read all those messages a lack of rapport really is n't it ? ###You 're saying it 's not not it is n't impossible but it 's harder to generate a warmth over the phone is n't it ? 
318173:10	###He 's interrupting . ###I think it can also be I think Have you never 
318215:10	###You know you can . ###And er I think that helps and er they 'll talk to each other you know . 
318273:13	###Listen . ###Yes .

318688:40	###of the first thing and fixing that in your mind and then well you ca n't keep abreast of how much . ###Anything else girls ? 
318731:9	###But I wo n't sorry could you repeat that again . ###Yes . 
318792:16	###Mm . ###Yes usually erm someone manages the place somewhere . 
318794:10	###Or even if you have to clarify the title by saying who is responsible for making sure that materials that you use arrive at the place that they 're supposed to arrive at the time . ###Who 's responsible for your organization of that sort of backup . 
318796:10	###You might have to be more clear about what you 're specifically asking for rather than use handles titles . ###You understand ? 
318809:77	###But if you use the function who is responsible for doing then you can often find out who . ###So you need to be careful of the language . 
318811:53	###Is there anything else that you learned thinking of the exercise now listening when you put the shoe on the other foot and you have to stick to . ###What other things do you think could have helped you ? 
318818:24	###Make notes . ###Well you make notes when you 're listening to customers and make notes when you were questioning me did I and it was hard to even if it 's only four or five questions it was hard to pull together . 
318819:7	###Well you make notes when you 're listening to customers and make notes when you were questioning me did I and it was hard to even if it 's only four or five questions it was hard to pull together . ###Or I ca n't do it I have to scribble . 
318878:12	###When the man in the wallpaper shop was he was tried flogging floor tiles instead of concentrating on wall coverings and so on . ###Erm he perhaps he remembered who he was talking to and what it was all about . 
319033:72	###I know the company ca n't do without you . ###What would happen if you were ill ? 
319084:172	###Well it 's it , it 's very much like , you know , a lot of things I 've come across in everyday language where , where people , I do n't know , er friends and relatives have found out that somebody 's been gay , oh well I never thought it of him , he seemed like such a nice person as well ###Mm . 
319090:88	###it 's like sort of a guy comes into lectures and , and , and he can be , particularly when talking about things like racism and disability , be quite liberal as it were , you know , and that kind of when you get him down the pub all on his own er a quite different repertoire comes out so er ###situational . 
319120:137	###erm and I was just thinking about erm how people actually label people ###Yeah .

323751:62	###What was your job ? ###What did you do ? 
323751:172	###What was your job ? ###What did you do ? 
323771:21	###motorcycle side-cars were very much a luxury trade you see . ###It was totally devoted to war work . 
323775:45	###and also the Home Guard or the army were in the house at the far side of the airport which was called Aldridge Lodge they were very much in there the erm ###Where there ever any breaches of security ? 
323783:140	###Erm how types of craftsmen were employed there to do things ? ###Well there were electricians there were carpenters , the carpenters were into directly involved with building aircraft but they used to create the engines and make engine stands such things and do maintenance work around . 
323787:81	###Not as I remember no funnily enough but they used to have people who , who went out to work at different airports after the planes had gone out they used to have gangs that went out to Perton and er we used to draw equipment from er the maintenance un RAF maintenance unit at Stafford things used to come from there . ###What did these gangs go out to Perton for , what was that all about ? 
323798:24	###Well in the war five pounds a week was extraordinary money , cos they used to say a fella had got a good job if he was getting five pounds a week in those days , so that when I started work first I , I was getting fifteen shillings a week , so you can understand that seventy five pence today , at fourteen . ###I went to the Bluecoat School in Walsall and they erm they used to run a A T C wing in there which later to belonged to and they they brought this Hawker Demon in , which was a plane into the playground for the instruction of the A T C fellas and the kids all ripped the canvas off it for souvenirs and it was down to a skeleton in no time 
323822:20	###No , no I 've never been down and er they 've always been full of water whenever I 've been up around there . ###Did they have problems with keeping the water out during the time they were storing the 
323837:215	###Tell me about V E day . ###Yes , I was working at Walsall airport er Walsall electrics , sorry , at the time and er I 've been out to the pictures I , with a couple of friends and er I got home this particular evening and I put the late night dance music on on the radio and they , they interrupted the programme to tell us that er Germany had accepted unconditional surrender and the war was over . 
323846:7	###What was his name do you remember it ? ###Colonel with a K the this band , they used to , that they had from the tenth replacement depot used to come down and play at the Town Hall , and they they like I said before they were fellas on the way to join Glen the absolute ultimate musicians of America and it was why I 'm still today erm I 've got a big collection of jazz records and have always been interested in the big band sound . 
323878:200	###When was that about , what year would that be ? ###I think it was the impetus of them getting promoted and the enthusiasm the er then the next home match was against Newcastle which Walsall played to a packed house . 
323883:206	###When would that have been about this were they in the second division then or ###Oh no no it would be ten fifteen years ago I think . 
323883:268	###When would that have been about this were they in the second division then or ###Oh no no it would be ten fifteen years ago I think . 
323904:53	###Well that that is now accommodation for away supporters down at there is no cover over it as yet , there were plans to make a covered stand of it but er they have n't it has been covered over and that 's where the away supporters still stand to this day and a little bit around the corner at the bottom end , at the railway end as they call it now , not the laundry end . ###What about the Hilary Street end is that still open ? 
323961:16	###What about the ground itself ? ###Was it a good ground to play on ? 
324050:64	###Half a gross on each board yeah , oh you could n't move away from your board at all and it was erm Mr his eyes seemed to be perhaps I should n't tell you this , but I 'm going to , it may be a bit humorous for you my er Mr used to send me out through the back way into street I think it is now , to wait for the paperman with a sporting book oh should I have said that ? ###No that 's all right 
324057:198	###And then some at Jailside Parkses and in the , during the winter months we used to , we had a spot to meet about half a dozen of us from the various factories , because we were afraid to walk home through and that way er because men used to wait in Lane . ###This was while you were working at was it ? 
324059:235	###Yeah oh yeah I did n't work anywhere else in Willenhall at all , and erm but we 'd got to be in for seven o' clock and if erm you were n't in for seven o' clock and sometimes I used to hear the bell began ringing when I got to go around the corner and get into the , but you had to wait a quarter of an hour before they would let you in and that was stopped off your money and my wage was eight and fourpence a week . ###Were you allowed to keep that money ? 
324071:77	###About half and hour and er , I used to take my sandwiches with me you see you could n't , there were no canteens then , you 'd got to take it was a bottle no and flasks ###So there was nowhere to heat anything up or anything like that ?

324166:9	###Oh oh yes yes the union did erm get that er sorted out you know , and er and then when the buses began to run it made it easier for those worked in Willenhall and er and it just be about threepence of fourpence in our money go there then , but erm and then the hours were altered you see , eight o' clock and finish at six o' clock and er and then it used to be seven to seven you see . ###Mm . 
324297:146	###Yes a long street or somewhere around there , and yes I mean many oh many a time I 've , you 'd see ca every Wednesday night you 'd see the cattle being driven up . ###Always the same night was it ? 
324399:9	###Quite a time really ? ###Yeah , yeah , oh yes of course a lot of the people were , that were in the we were in under the balcony but they were up to their knees in plaster and goodness knows what that had come out of the roof they could n't move it all dropped round them . 
324420:9	###Mm . ###Where did you train ? 
324461:7	###and so we had our own homes , for the boys in Brighton when they were older and the girls at Hastings . ###Oh I see . 
324469:17	###They were n't , you know they did n't , were n't girls that would er in those days know what they 're doing so much you know . ###No , no .

324689:20	###and the night we slept in the garden and the night before we went we , Mrs was taken ill and I was giving her , tepid sponges up and the towel where she was sleeping in the garden ###Mm . 
324705:58	###They used to ring a bell up at the hotel . ###I see . 
324710:54	###All the English families went down south . ###Oh yes . 
324733:74	###There was over a thousand lads on the camp ###Mm .

325207:48	###Then they used to take the others back and put them in the yard again . ###Yeah , that was every Monday , that was , yeah . 
325353:98	###It picked up yes . ###Couple of years after the war it got sort er bit more freer , you see . 
325354:10	###Couple of years after the war it got sort er bit more freer , you see . ###Then er on a Saturdays our slaughterhouse was , our slaughterhouse was still open up the street then and we used to perhaps kill twelve , fourteen pigs for private people , but they had to give their ration up , six months ' or twelve months ' ration up to have these pigs . 
325451:47	###allocated from the ce ###there was , there was slaughterhouses at different places , you see , and all these bullocks went to the market and they was graded with the government people , you see , and perhaps , twenty or thirty bullocks 'd go to Ely and about forty go to Cambridge slaughterhouse .

325963:64	###And Harry then had just Ernie to help on the slaughtering . ###Well he was just a slaughterman then he always used to try and have Frank , another one of our butcher boys , or David or Frank to help him . 
326001:9	###I felt after working hard for twenty seven years I felt it was a shame . ###I did n't accept er the opportunity to retire and take it easy , it seemed as if I had worked twenty seven years for nothing !

326463:8	###You see these young men here . ###Those of us who have fought those of us who have fought still have one job we can do and that is to see that the military capability of the United States is such that no potential aggressor will ever dare attack us . 
326630:68	###Some of the local fellas would trade cigarettes to the local farmers for eggs to fry and a lot of other stuff . ###Well anyway getting back to on hardstand number thirteen , it seemed as if he was filling his , it ran out of supplies , so he was filling his supply tank and one of the flight crew of the airplane bumped into him so he spilled this mixture of gasoline and oil over the stove and naturally the tent caught on fire .

326819:24	###Yes , well anyhow that , that more or less covers the early part of me being on the beat . ###Well then 
326840:7	###I do n't really think at that time I would have had enough experience to justify going on the staff . ###I , I

326970:52	###You know , anyhow . ###Yes , yes .

327057:45	###When you talk about f fire prevention , what do you actually mean ? ###Yep , well , I mean the objective of fire prevention is to , is to try and make places safer and to alert people to erm to the risks and dangers of fire , before it happens , that that 's , the objective is to er try and stop fires happening .

327195:13	###Have there ever been any fire ladies , you 've got firemen ? ###Erm , they have n't had them in Suffolk , we 've had one or two try to join and one did reasonably well , but right at the end of , of the , of one of the tests , the strength tests , she failed , she could n't quite manage it erm

327257:45	###Very , very rare indeed . ###Now that 's marvellous I think . 
327281:43	###They 're very pleased at that because I mean they obviously found it to be useful , erm we proved it to be useful and it 's nice to see them all taking on this responsibility now , now and doing it , because that 's all progress . ###It sounds like the Fire Service has come a long way from the early years . 
327287:85	###So we were all issued with army battledress . ###I mean , nowadays you 've got nice jackets and , and , and so on , and the hats were , were stiff sort of hats with , caps rather with wire brims on them , you know and , and they , they were really flat on the top and there was no style with them or anything , it was , it was the styles of the , of the forties I suppose and , and nowadays it 's so much smarter and nicer and more comfortable as well . 
327289:68	###The battledress was very good , I mean the army seemed to wore it all that time so er we had it for several years and we had to press that every day , thick material , very heavy . ###Press it every day ?

327313:9	###I 'm well . ###Er medically , as best as I understand what the doctors tell me , er I 'm er fine to carry the responsibilities and strain of er the cabinet job that I had .

327499:7	###I believed she was one hundred percent right . ###I believed then and I believe now . 
327500:9	###I believed then and I believe now . ###I must make that absolutely clear . 
327531:21	###What would it need to provoke you then ? ###We 'll just see . 
327609:54	###And the more you stand back and look at it , the clearer it is . ###Every political leader of an advanced democracy , is in deep trouble , whether it 's in America , Japan , France , Germany or Britain . 
327624:45	###You said exactly that I quote word for word in November nineteen ninety and a week later what happened ? ###You challenged Mrs Thatcher and brought her down . 
327629:73	###Er I thought that it was wrong that she should , as everybody knows . ###Er and I think frankly erm we won the election because she was not leader of the party . 
327666:34	###Smaller majority . ###It is only small because a very limited number of Conservatives on the back benches are not totally reliable on too many occasions . 
327678:9	###The dash The the the sort of headline dash out of the House of Commons , the moment the news breaks , to get on television with some quick quote . ###And then to withhold one 's vote as with almost a matter of habit and routine , that cannot be in the best interests of the Conservative party . 
327690:77	###You then stand for election . ###The reason why you 're elected is because a sufficient number of people wanted a Conservative government . 
327701:9	###I 've made it clear I I personally like virtually all colleagues at some stage voted against my party . ###I and that will always be a right and proper thing for a member of parliament to do . 
327733:9	###Er I think they genuinely believe their case , it 's not a case that I believe , but I I 've always genuinely respected them for the case they take . ###Er so I I do n't find it in my in myself to condemn people who as Conservatives take a different view to myself . 
327734:76	###Er so I I do n't find it in my in myself to condemn people who as Conservatives take a different view to myself . ###But there has to be a degree of discretion , a degree of responsibility . 
327781:22	###The fact of the matter is , every directive that comes out of Europe , comes with the agreement of the British government . ###That 's where it comes from . 
327794:19	###So poverty is worse ? ###Er not relative not relative poverty because obviously the tide of prosperity has brought up the living standards of er the western world . 
327801:112	###Er no , Beveridge did , but he never intended to achieve what we 've got . ###Er I mean , you will know that I wrote a book called No time for Ostriches in when I was on the back benches , in favour of work fare . 
327808:11	###There 's absolutely no point in saying to some sixty five year old or or seventy year old who 's living on a state pension in a council house , What you 've got to do is help yourself . ###What 's it mean ? 
327809:9	###What 's it mean ? ###So the government must help ? 
327833:96	###Now that 's significant , that is n't just a this is n't just a debate about some vague ideological nicety , how many angels on the head of a pin ? ###This is fundamental to the way British politics is going . 
327851:16	###Mi ###What have we been doing all this time ? 
327872:9	###And that should apply also w with the railways . ###There 's no great enthusiasm in in this country for railway privatization . 
327874:34	###The railways must be kept together say on the on the Peyton amendment and they could raise money on the private market . ###but it keeps together The idea that they 're going to broke up br broken up into competing er items , worries people in my constituency and it also alarms me . 
327886:7	###They chose the state railways because theirs was the lowest bid . ###they gave them a three year trial period , to see how attractive they could make the service . 
327904:32	###Cos there are people in Britain who simply do n't believe that the public sector can be as efficient as the private sector . ###I think we can show that this is possible . 
327912:49	###At least a growing number of Tory M Ps are coming round to the idea . ###The key question is how many Conservative m Ps are on board for the Peyton amendment . 
327928:17	###But I think there is room for compromise here . ###I 'd be surprised at the end of the day if er we did n't find a solution that would enable John Macgregor to go forward . 
328044:10	###If it does n't absorb it it will cut horrendously into circulation figures in my view . ###Because there 's never been a time before when all newspapers have gone up simultaneously . 
328045:32	###Because there 's never been a time before when all newspapers have gone up simultaneously . ###We 've had to cut prices of some of our newspapers in order to prevent a decline in circulation . 
328058:47	###And I think we 've seen a good number of those erm from the Telegraph , the Mail and the Express , going to the Times . ###Because the Times price cut was so large , no-one 's sure if its gains are due to the publicity , or it 's proved wrong the conventional wisdom about quality newspaper pricing .

328064:68	###it expects them to lose a staggering twenty million pounds in the first year . ###But Associated Newspapers reckons it 's well worth it . 
328087:35	###And that 's very good from our point of view . ###Rasing prices when others are cutting is a bold , high risk strategy . 
328095:126	###And we 'd only be interested i with that scenario that you could virtually er get the Independent at a song otherwise it would n't be worth having . ###The question that is raised about the Independent , is not whether it exists , but who owns it .

328164:30	###Most British firms even if they recognize the problem , do n't do anything about it . ###But in the wake of legal precedents from America , the prospect of workers suing their employers for stress related illnesses could soon be a real one .

328263:16	###Because it 's been linked to so many other illnesses like heart disease and ulcers , stress is thought to indirectly account for as much as a third of all U S health-care costs . ###Rising stress claims have also been bad news for big employers like Wells Fargo Bank , the California institution which echoes back to the stage coach era .

328440:62	###Joshua , did Mr Justice Garland explain why it would n't be possible to instruct a jury to ignore the publicity and concentrate on the specific charges . ###Well I think he made it clear that no jury could forget what everybody knew er which is of course er the the facts that emerged at the time er that the Birmingham Six were acquitted . 
328448:125	###Well he did n't reveal any of this new material and none of it was revealed in open court . ###Er it 's a matter of speculation as to whether it did play any part .

328668:21	###Only making this coded appeal for the armed forces not to be left too stretched over too many tasks . ###The white paper that was published some months ago indicates I think , very clearly , the kind of commitments that we have and the way in which we are meeting those commitments .

332071:13	###And you dilute it with more methylated spirits . ###But you 've got to be very very careful because if you use too much methylated spirits , it cuts and takes the polish off . 
332079:14	###Well you mix up er you mix up some colours , black and er and black and wh i stuff Bismarck brown which Mix them together and you make a colour to match up the rest and maybe bring in darker streaks and make a pat You know what I mean ? ###Mm . 
332085:106	###Mm . ###It 's just polisher he could get a job , see that . 
332130:33	###Mhm . ###But there were some like Cathy 's er My chum was Cathy and it was her mother and she was a first class French French polisher you know , and her daughter was a French polisher who was a chum of mine and her son was a cabinet maker and er we used to laugh we used to say . 
332132:25	###different people you say , Oh my , your house must be lovely Mrs . ###Er you 've two French polishers . 
332146:41	###Yes . ###Mm . 
332184:10	###You know there was there was quite a there was quite a number of people er lost their lives at that particular time . ###What year was that ? 
332230:181	###So it was n't well ventilated ? ###Mm . 
332246:180	###And er that was the first time I 'd ever seen a continental headboard . ###And they had got this contract for this er this lawyer who there was a great big er case it had run for long enough . 
332283:73	###Something else . ###And you would go back to that and you would maybe have um you maybe had you 'd maybe have a chest of drawers and the drawers were out and you would be polishing you know , doing so much on them , put them aside and then go back to that . 
332414:89	###. He was a cabinet maker and er then the boss and we just all sort of worked You know sometimes we had a quite a lot of work going and other times we would n't have anything and other times you were standing waiting doing nothing , waiting in the job g coming for the cabinet makers who would send through legs , something to get started just as long as we got started to work , maybe it was in a hurry . ###We just started on different things you know . 
332572:65	###big houses you know . ###But er I would I would have liked to have been able to done that you know . 
332614:15	###Why is it called French polishing ? ###I do n't know how it came to be , whether it was the the French that really in invented it . 
332622:9	###Mhm . ###And er you know , the different er things they can tell you just how l old a thing th And then I think they were the sort of the fashion Er you know they were first in the fashion trade to introduce these sort of things you know . 
332639:28	###After the war we 'll get nationalization you see . ###But that was er er a a faint hope . 
332656:11	###But I do n't think there were any anyone that I knew on the railway were not against nationalization . ###They were all for nationalization , because they believed that nationalization was the only way to solve the problems of the development the future development of the railways . 
332663:104	###And that 's why at that time , near the end of the war , and when the talk of nationalization become greater , the hope of nationalization because as I said before , never in our wildest dream did we think that Labour would get in with such an overwhelming majority . ###But the the the railway stock was in such a bad state , that that 's when people started the real activists of the Labour movement really started talking about confiscation instead of compensation . 
332667:9	###But I do n't know how it was , but it came about that this confiscation business was dropped just as soon as we Labour got into power . ###That the government got into power , That seemed to be put aside , confiscation . 
332668:8	###That the government got into power , That seemed to be put aside , confiscation . ###No we had to be fair , was the saying , for the leaders . 
332671:10	###You see , A fair price for their stocks and their holdings . ###Now that disappointed me I know , because I knew from where I stood , that the stuff was practically worthless . 
332735:7	###That 's how they were placed in the position you see . ###Alf Robbins , Lord Robbins as he was then , knew what was going on . 
332796:28	###Because he was just doing the same job as he 'd been doing under the private under the L N E R. Management were more conciliatory when nationalization came on . ###See in pre-nationalization days , a superintendent was the big chief . 
332820:28	###And I should have told him , if you 've any complaints , come to the branch meeting and make your complaints there . ###But er I knew that it was n't poss always possible for one to be at the branch meeting you see . 
332889:7	###The worker paid his contribution and that was for own benefit . ###Shocking when you think of it is n't it , your wife and family . 
332889:79	###The worker paid his contribution and that was for own benefit . ###Shocking when you think of it is n't it , your wife and family . 
332890:27	###Shocking when you think of it is n't it , your wife and family . ###You had to pay them five shillings a visit to the doctor , and then your spectacles or any dental treatment you got , you had to pay for them . 
332911:12	###Security and Health that 's from the cradle to the grave , it 's a wonderful a wonderful thing . ###And Ni Bevan obviously felt that for he fought tooth and nail to get it through . 
332973:37	###And I settled for that . ###You see , And it was a just a bit of a trick , I was putting in the rosters you see . 
333135:105	###To the Edinburgh , at least the Scotland passengers , to Carstairs to connect up to the main Glasgow Central to Liverpool , Birmingham and there were all these places . ###And London . 
333276:64	###If if it had n't caught , it was a dull sound you see , a thud . ###Whereas if it caught , there were a cling a ring you see .

335739:9	###remember here well that was certainly true for the Wintertime . ###Yes . 
335748:28	###There was Sammy and Davie and and er from Comely Bank , Willie and Jim they were all Stevedores and Andrew and They were stevedores you see a lot of . ###They worked at that just unloading on the boats . 
335872:28	###And in that time you see , the steamer did n't come so often . ###And a drifter would have come out with any soldiers that was coming home on leave and that . 
335990:87	###And kept them . ###Mhm . 
336148:63	###Yes that was the diamond jubilee . ###Yes .

337131:33	###And er and then he was the only one who did it . ###I see so the older chaps would just gradually 
337150:51	###And they did a lot of things just the old way you know , where they had the ###Mm . 
337172:20	###Aha . ###to take 
337184:12	###That was it . ###And his keep at home . 
337194:11	###And then how long would a apprenticeship take then ? ###Aye well I think it was three years . 
337200:9	###I 'm not certain about that . ###Aha . 
337204:9	###Right . ###Mhm . 
337238:18	###It was just seen as a normal part of the job then really . ###It was indeed aha . 
337241:7	###And it ###Yeah . 
337248:10	###and you would he used to go to the house and ###Mhm . 
337250:8	###and er had to measure up the body because the coffins were made to measure . ###Oh I see . 
337250:42	###and er had to measure up the body because the coffins were made to measure . ###Oh I see . 
337305:11	###Mhm . ###Mhm . 
337307:9	###for the sides had to be shaped . ###mhm .

337378:77	###Oh much longer . ###Much longer . 
337379:33	###Much longer . ###Between because before they got he went away and measured up the body and he also had sometime then you see he would have to go and put the body in the coffin . 
337381:13	###And before the funeral the they would he would probably have to take a window out of the house . ###Oh 
337387:89	###Yeah . ###Aha . 
337389:76	###I mean you like the ordinary houses are , there 's no room and you could not bend the coffin with a person in it so they would have to take the window or the bedroom or wherever the corpse was ###Mhm .

337424:12	###Aha . ###Aha . 
337454:12	###Mhm . ###With a name on . 
337455:49	###With a name on . ###And that also had to be done by hand . 
337465:20	###Aha . ###Ready made . 
337474:17	###Ah . ###Mhm . 
337483:11	###I mean if they were known widely through the island they might have bids going further but it might just be your own district . ###Mhm .

338801:14	###Were they ? ###Yeah . 
338878:16	###Did you ? ###Yes . 
338929:44	###And a big hat and she had a big bow she looked you know . ###Yes . 
338930:23	###Yes . ###Can you tell me about erm a typical days work that you would have to do . 
338931:40	###Can you tell me about erm a typical days work that you would have to do . ###Can you remember what you 'd have to do ? 
338931:55	###Can you tell me about erm a typical days work that you would have to do . ###Can you remember what you 'd have to do ? 
338931:76	###Can you tell me about erm a typical days work that you would have to do . ###Can you remember what you 'd have to do ? 
338938:28	###ready to put in the oven see . ###Yes . 
338980:7	###oh yes I liked it . ###Yes . 
339032:33	###Oh I think the work the work was very hard in those days you know . ###Mm . 
339035:7	###Oh no . ###You did n't think that ? 
339074:30	###And er they used to catch er pheasants and er what else , the pheasants and ###Poultry . 
339074:41	###And er they used to catch er pheasants and er what else , the pheasants and ###Poultry . 
339181:13	###But I got with that some some time . ###Did you was it you who chose to go and work in Llaneilian or did they send you to work there from ? 
339182:7	###Did you was it you who chose to go and work in Llaneilian or did they send you to work there from ? ###Oh no We had to look for work . 
339195:9	###Yeah . ###Mm . 
339222:7	###Oh yes . ###You did ? 
339222:18	###Oh yes . ###You did ? 
339222:39	###Oh yes . ###You did ? 
339225:8	###Yes . ###Mm . 
339253:14	###Yes . ###Erm what did what did your other brothers and sisters do when they when they left school ? 
339254:15	###Erm what did what did your other brothers and sisters do when they when they left school ? ###Oh they they had to go to service . 
339306:25	###Yeah . ###Mm . 
339319:9	###S and they were paid by the church ? ###Yes . 
339411:9	###Mm . ###So I was left on the on the on the on the verge . 
339555:12	###We , we 'll almost certainly finish about quarter to four . ###Now if anybody seriously objects to , to this , erm , I actually do give everybody my home telephone number and I 'll be happy to carry on er , a remedial session er , later tonight . 
339662:87	###This is of course , assuming that you get your expenses reimbursed . ###If you are in the unfortunate position where you do not get your expenses reimbursed , my best advice is go get a job where they are , er , because this is one of the few good things going , er , in terms of tax efficiency and all the rest of it . 
339666:210	###Er , there are , I think it 's ten columns and thirty one rows , erm , so that you can plot where your money is going if you need to . ###Some amazingly well organised people , and this does , category does not include me , erm , also use these for their personal expenses . 
339687:45	###make it easy to ###The expense envelopes always go at the back , because they 're bigger than anything else that you 're going to get , to , to put in the binder . 
339757:9	###Well I thought the English one was so they 'll come as a massive shock because they 're not on the calendar cards , but no , I do n't . ###I mean I do n't find the rest of them interesting . 
339777:83	###I was last in my office yesterday , as it happens . ###The next time I 'm going to be in my office will be a week next Tuesday , as I , you know , I 'm due to arrive in on the twenty eighth . 
339791:22	###And I think I 'll stop right there with even more comments , erm , in case I lose that contract too . ###Erm , so those are the options with the , the , the reschedule marker . 
339817:11	###And it 's something I 'm experimenting with myself but I have n't quite got it right . ###Certainly , I mean , something you should be aware of , however , if you 're using colour coding , if you 're using symbols and abbreviations , is the minute that you need a key to understand your own abbreviations and your , or what the colours mean , you 're wasting time . 
339821:19	###Erm , you know and that 's just insane . ###It 's supposed to save you time , erm , not make your life more difficult . 
339833:130	###I want to be aware of that when I 'm planning my month . ###The second says mailing list . 
339838:44	###Erm , I 'm doing an exhibition next month , I need new panels for my exhibition stand . ###The people who make these panels are closely related to estate agents , in other words they are a lower life-form . 
339846:21	###Next , going back to that erm , you know , I said that the key business goal there was to create a mailing list . ###Now I know from past experience , that creating that mailing list is going to take approximately sixteen hours of my time . 
339846:52	###Next , going back to that erm , you know , I said that the key business goal there was to create a mailing list . ###Now I know from past experience , that creating that mailing list is going to take approximately sixteen hours of my time . 
339847:97	###Now I know from past experience , that creating that mailing list is going to take approximately sixteen hours of my time . ###Er , I do n't physically have to type out the labels , but I have physically have to be in the office , to initiate the computer sorts , because under something called personal job insurance scheme , I 've layered the sort of routine under a lot of security codes and I 'm only , the only person who knows where they are . 
339901:85	###So it , it is constant repetition of something that 's actually important . ###Erm , again if you 're not comfortable doing this kind of thing then you should n't do it obviously , and the last thing on the monthly calendar card is as you 'll see er , er on the twenty fourth , twenty fifth , twenty sixth and twenty seventh , it has another personal message there . 
339966:12	###Er , in any detail . ###It is not enough just to have that prioritised list . 
340025:8	###Yes , I 've not started to plan the day yet . ###And inevitably when you turn up a diary page you have between say one and twelve things already entered into the to do list . 
340044:122	###Now going back , at this particular day , I have forward reminders er , they represent different sorts of forward reminders , so I 'll go through those in detail . ###Before I do that , you know , let me point out , I 've got three commitments on this particular day . 
340084:149	###Underneath expense and reimbursement record , I 've got two personal items there . ###Erm , I mean I separate them out , incidently because they have equal validity . 
340132:32	###Erm , I erm , employ people , so I decided to have an employment section , six months later when I was reviewing the daytimer , I discovered that I had one sheet in my employment section , er , about a lady I had interviewed and not employed , whereas I had a prospect section that was overflowing , and needed drastic sub-division . ###I was able , because I 'm a director of the company , to tear up my dividers and steel another set . 
340224:65	###You have an ice-breaker , and then , and then on to the important stuff . ###And lastly you 've got material needed and people responsible for bringing it . 
340224:117	###You have an ice-breaker , and then , and then on to the important stuff . ###And lastly you 've got material needed and people responsible for bringing it . 
340248:61	###Why do c , I 'm sorry I 've just remembered something I have n't covered , okay . ###What you can do is to insert the cardboard backing into the envelope like that and then you put that bit through the rings , and then it becomes a tear pad . 
340302:82	###Every job that I give Kevin I write down a , a brief summary of what that task was , and I leave a gap of three lines . ###When the job is over , I then write a brief summary appraisal , as it were on his performance . 
340336:41	###When you 've got enough boss imposed interruptions on the sheet , you know , twelve to fifteen , take the rest of the week off . ###You will be right , he fished . 
340339:116	###And maybe the solution would be regular one-to-one meeting for ten minutes in the morning , and you could get rid of all this garbage , in one go , rather than having him wander in , or her wander in , at any particular time , you know , and just disrupt your flow . ###So that 's what this sheet is for , it 's an interruptions log , particularly good er , when you 're with the boss . 
340357:186	###Erm , and you can certainly use them for that . ###I use them for breaking down annual goals , to monthly goals . 
340415:13	###An and I I 'll keep me mouth shut . ###That would make a change 
340522:49	###This is one of the major problems of the civilianisation program . ###Er as we know round about July August time , the remaining nine P C 's will be er turned into civilians wave of a magic wand the biggest problem there is the total loss of our skills base overnight effectively , the second thing is it 'll take a long long time to get them trained particularly in relation to A L O work . 
340525:166	###It could take a number of years before we get them all on A L O courses and in fact there 's no way w I assume there 's no way we can put them on A L O courses til they 've done a crime prevention course at Is that right David ? ###er Yeah 
340616:14	###Yep ###So is he to be he does n't know whether to just carry on or to put a stop to it now or what the hell to do 
340620:10	###But th the thing is that Ashfield and Mansfield are still stra sending him plans ###yep three ?

341143:26	###files ###Oh 
341465:7	###I bet I 've done it four or five times this year already ###Yeah bu bu but the thing is its 
341470:121	###Yeah but it End of tape ###Any plans ? 
341507:98	###Yeah ###Once a co-ordinator 's retired or resigned who do you actually communicate with to find out if the group wants to continue playing 
341535:101	###That trawl will bring out a couple of dozen schemes that have totally lapsed , and people will write snotty letters saying I 've told you this once before . ###Mm yeah 
341559:18	###I think we still have priority at the moment to computers , in effect Paul is going to ###We might as well 
341605:22	###I 've been offered the opportunity by er Bob in training er in force have taken this on er the tactical unit have taken it on , the chance of er one day erm assessment or appraisal training , at erm probably at Exeter for those of us that do it and erm I think that perhaps with the the way that the diverse way that our staff 's spread out the proper ways of assessing people which I 've I 've never been shown how to do and I do n't think many of us have . ###Erm I mean he it sort of went through our staff inspector wise and er Paul was sort of chatting , and he was n't being unkind he said yes , they 'll be dinosaurs because it 's a long time since you 've had er any training like that . 
341650:14	###yeah ###We 're not gonna put any down cos it 's going somewhere else 
341653:7	###Erm Bob Bob ###No no no 
341735:29	###Take sugar ? ###No thank you . 
341892:32	###Just looking at yourself , not taking your wife 's salary into account , just yourself ###Yeah sure . 
341928:46	###That 's right , yeah . ###After six months you would only get half your salary so this would then go down to fifteen thousand . 
341943:49	###Yeah okay yeah . ###Holidays ? 
341949:11	###and the things that we 're left with are all the bills ###Essentials . 
341974:14	###The car would go . ###The education would go . 
341987:30	###If I can , if you can just concentrate on that figure now ###Mm . 
342008:45	###If you were to take out erm health insurance cover ###Mhm . 
342110:50	###Yeah . ###the only thing but I mean you know you accepted what he said and then went on and , and by using your picture with the , with the cheque I mean you had him eating out your hand at the end did n't you ? 
342143:141	###Yeah . ###that er Martin worked with . 
342316:7	###You wo n't see the papers again but you 'll get , I mean you should n't really see them I have ###No . 
342322:46	###they 'll have rung all your branches and given the results ###Right . 
342490:15	###Well what I would like to do is obviously erm when would be convenient to come back and see you ? ###Oh you want to come back ? 
342521:35	###Fine I 'll just take a note of that , thank you . ###Right . 
342621:198	###that 's the way that I saw it . ###Erm I 'm not quite sure about this , I may be wrong , but I thought that maybe that you could 've erm questioned him a little bit more about why he thought he needed to speak to his accountant . 
342684:19	###because , you know , especially to people , and this is this is not talking down to people but er to somebody who does n't understand pensions or anything who ###I 'm a carpenter I 'm not a rocket scientist either , yeah . 
342728:232	###Yeah . ###Because the then again I was er at the back of the form and I knew who his accountant was er 
342733:129	###Mhm . ###Er and as for budgets erm you know I 'd , I 'd be saying to people come on you 're not buying a raffle ticket , let 's talk serious funding . 
342763:53	###Yeah . ###Well and , and the press comments th that have been made here , you know , that you could end up 
342828:15	###Funny enough I 'm tired ###last night actually and it did n't exactly help , well , it 's a long trip up here , longer than I expected and I did n't 
342839:12	###because I ###did you come ? 
342839:30	###because I ###did you come ? 
342855:15	###Yeah . ###it 's just that all I heard all morning was there 's so many delays there with all the water , surface water erm so I thought well let 's try and avoid that . 
342905:25	###No . ###They just left you to it ? 
343150:73	###So erm ###Mm . 
343162:219	###Possibly and sometimes the C C Q . ###Yeah . 
343207:47	###What affect will that have upon you or your family if you made inadequate erm pension provision ? ###Have we got notes on this er 
343225:45	###pounds ###pounds a week , you know , you know the kids are off your hand pounds a week would pay your , would just cover your er your food bill . 
343427:269	###The exploration ne the exploration of needs by open probes erm confirming by visual er conceptualization using PEGGY use whatever tools you have available at your armoury but do n't move on until you feel the guy is either totally not committed to do something or sufficiently disturbed to do something . ###Again be aware you do n't go completely OTT . 
343439:74	###Yeah , great . ###Step two exploration of needs . 
343442:37	###Soft facts are also important as they 'll help you to get to know your client better , to understand their feelings , views and aspirations in a number of areas . ###At the same time look for referral opportunities , for example if a group hobby has been identified then who does your client do that hobby with ? 
343476:36	###How would you afford it ? ###I do n't know . 
343505:21	###Right . ###Okay so the mortgage is paid but what do you suggest your wife does with the forty five thousand pounds ? 
343534:24	###Oscar material ! ###appointment all areas should have been discussed . 
343552:37	###any queries before arranging your second appointment . ###So when would be the best time for me to come back and present these ideas to you ? 
343572:42	###Aha . ###You should proceed to support these referrals with age , occupation , family circumstances and so on . 
343596:55	###So Robert , Barry and Gareth you 'll be doing role play number one which is linked around life assurance . ###Joan , Diane and Max will be on P H I which is role play number two , Bill , Roger and Vince you 'll be looking at pensions and Rob you 'll be just doing savings . 
343603:17	###So know that , if you now refer back to the , the book that I 've given you this morning and if you turn to where it says okay it says stop here do not read on ###if you can subsequently turn over from there you 'll see inverted commas first appointment skills . 
343633:21	###Or does that come later ? ###No okay , so you just have the appropriate page which relates to his savings for the future . 
343646:94	###So you do record the role play but you do n't play it back . ###So it 's vitally important now that the people that are watching really do pay attention cos you 're not gonna get a second bite of the cherry . 
343652:22	###No secrets . ###the appropriate sales person so that he and she can log it away in the manual . 
344171:62	###Wo n't it just . ###But that , that is a problem . 
344391:18	###Step two yeah ? ###Who 's next then ? 
344545:31	###Thanks Ron . ###you 're marvellous Bill . 
344631:35	###Oh just say I know him quite well . ###Yeah I knew Joe s yeah , I know Joe very well . 
344718:112	###I , I found it with utmost ease . ###Mhm . 
344745:11	###Now erm how , how long is it since you 've seen anyone from Friends Provident ? ###Coo ! 
344769:15	###I mean like you , you , you chose the route via the post ###Yes . 
345013:85	###Mm . ###erm would you have any objection to letting me contact them ? 
345091:190	###Erm and then after the , the greeting you went , the actual erm way that you went was statement of purpose and then you did actually start asking for referrals , you started but then you did n't actually follow anything up , you started the script of referrals but you did n't actually follow it up again with anything . ###And then you went on to the stat the statement of purpose again followed by your business and buy business card and buyer 's guide so erm tt that was that . 
345112:30	###Bill ? ###Very near the beginning Maggie gave a wee tip , do n't say you 're a representative say you 're an employee of Friends Provident , it makes life easier . 
345130:97	###Erm I thought you hung in there for referrals there , that was good , you , you were , you were a terrier there , you 're gonna get stuck in for referrals . ###The old handshake was just I was gonna see who was gonna let go first , well he was n't gonna let go so I thought erm you know 
345142:105	###Well t I mean to be honest erm tt I wanted to try some different things er cos I 've seen these guys today ###Yeah . 
345197:73	###Yeah . ###and you need the to get on level two . 
345267:32	###Yeah . ###and , and that 's er it 's all the slowness which was doing me in . 
345345:59	###my Lord another factual situation which I 'll simply referred to is the er on going debate in European commission or cases relating to up stream fuel , er , where there 's very little trade , erm for technical reasons because of the isolation of the United Kingdom , however the commission has searched jurisdiction over restricted competition in the market because the fuels have a direct impact upon product , erm from production costs , product down stream of which there is trade ###mm 
345359:47	###my Lord , the , the first point is the extent of what we 're claiming ###well , answer the question Mr , if your clients are n't gonna meet these claims , who is ? 
345369:106	###my Lord I , I , it ###the suspect counsel to is no they would n't , and they would raise precisely the same points as er being raised in this defence , er which are surely if there is anything in them , equally available to every other name 
345391:222	###well at , at , at the moment our , our defence of course goes to case , the defence by ###Robert this , this presumably implies that the agent is suing the name 
345392:22	###Robert this , this presumably implies that the agent is suing the name ###erm well it does n't necessary apply that the agent is suing the name , the question is whether , what any right the agent has got , er the fact of the matter is as I understand it and tell me if I 'm wrong , that your client has erm received a demand under clause nine er , er which he has failed to comply , I think that must follow because er if he had complied with it , then that would never of got as far as the central fund 
345423:46	###yes ###that risk 
345423:52	###yes ###that risk 
345428:23	###do n't be do n't necessary be influenced by those at ###although no doubt they are doing the best they can for you Mr , erm , but I mean that 's why , that 's what I was putting to you at the beginning . 
345431:196	###yes ###I mean if it 's then it 's the end to the clause , erm , er 
345446:46	###Belgium police officers ###them so much that I 'm worried about it 's the policy holders which I Mr 
345451:62	###the sums in the premiums trust fund , it 's a very simple answer my Lord to notify now in the same way the commission suggested that they should notify some ten years ago ###of course that would n't help would it on the er great mass of er policies that have presently been written in respect of which claims are likely to be received over the next fifteen to twenty years be included so help 
345454:75	###mm ###it is not the Armageddon situation that suggest . 
345465:43	###er yes you 're probably ###to establish them 
345467:7	###you 're probably right , but the point remains of course and I have to have ###my Lord 
345538:81	###no my Lord I 'm not saying ###restrictions no , well I 'd rather I did 
345619:157	###that 's how it 's effected ###if you exclude somebody on objective criteria 
345666:218	###yes the , the commission does n't seemed to of addressed itself to , to , the only question it seemed to of addressed itself to are whether the criteria objective , erm , that there could be reasons when it takes decisions and erm there should be an appeal procedure ###mm 
345674:73	###it 's a negative clearance ###negative clearance , yes 
345676:18	###my Lord that 's why we say it was so strict , the commission said you 're not getting exemption you have to remove everything from the market ###mm yes 
345683:115	###could er , I do n't think that can be right because had that been right , had the commission been saying you 've got restrictions but there not malign , then we 'll be given you exemption , they would of said you 've got restrictions but you 've justified them ###mm 
345689:17	###my Lord , no , er if you have a good reason for preventing someone who is capable of being a competitor , eighty five applies but you can only exempt , if you 've got a good reason for preventing someone who is incapable of being a competitor then eighty five one is inapplicable . ###You ca n't have a restriction of competition which falls outside of eighty five , one , it can be exempted . 
345690:19	###You ca n't have a restriction of competition which falls outside of eighty five , one , it can be exempted . ###so you say it must be implicit in that decision that the , the commission was satisfied that the objective criteria er would separate the sheep from the goats , erm so that no one who would , would be excluded who was capable of competing 
345698:65	###they , they have that power and er , erm article three I think regulation seventeen or er article erm , it 's article two or three regulation , article two of regulation , seventeen of nineteen sixty two , you can apply to the commission for negative appearance ###sorry article 
345718:111	###on the grounds that until I knew where I 'd got to ###yes my Lord 
345720:109	###erm , erm it might not be erm particularly helpful , but having thought about it again I , I quite like you , in , at least in broad outline er to hear what you have to say on the aspect orusese gnitteg ton er ' uoy dias ###yes my Lord 
345730:57	###I think that 's gonna be erm asking to much Mr because we have n't er beginning to loom very close you know erm ###yeah but he wondered if just that a short period of time could just get your Lordship a question of 
345762:39	###Erm , yes have you managed to gather your er notes ###Er no my Lord perhaps I was , I was thinking about time to let me just sort out 
345763:57	###Er no my Lord perhaps I was , I was thinking about time to let me just sort out ###would you like , would you like to hear what I have to say on that one Mr er do you want ? 
345781:57	###yes ###see it 
345812:49	###I do n't think any of us have ever seen it my Lord , erm the erm , the just , the , in this was a case where you will find er that er a reference was made for guidance as to the scope of the broadcasting directive ###yes 
345980:24	###Ian , , okay could you all please just draw a house ###Rachel , Ian , Gary , Pete , just those four of you , if you just draw a house , please , 
346035:31	###I 'm quite happy with mine , they do the business . ###There 's one student in our branch , and she runs the provisions department , in Bolton , yes 
346045:80	###Yes , yes , they have er , a temporary student , and they asked him to leave us , he 's , there 's no work for him like . ###But I 've got this other kid , he 's twenty eight , and he 's absolutely a waste of time , he does n't know anything about it . 
346048:10	###go , so these plonkers can stop here . ###There is a lot , there is a lot of tension there is n't there ? 
346064:108	###Well , were you a plonker when you started ? ###No , , it 's just a but he was , you know , I was fairly slow , and then I went on , I followed erm , I ended up slightly , as well , erm , then I went to college up to the age of eighteen , erm , and as soon as I finished college he made me a department manager . 
346067:121	###Erm , ###The question is , are you tapping that potential ? 
346093:56	###It depends some students are good and some students are n't . ###What happens with a student is they 're more likely to take the piss . 
346135:100	###Dee , how did you , how did that feel , the feedback ? ###It was alright , but I did n't know why it was good , or whether there was anything I should do better , it was just alright then , that 's it , I 've done it . 
346246:50	###He , he 's trying to make , he , he 's making him , you aggressive is n't he and I would say that he 's just thinking it 's low if I 'm going and this guy because , you know ###Yes , yes , I 've said , I 've said this , yes , why 
346289:9	###The rotters , the cads , the bounders , the bad-hats , exactly , yes . ###It 's my job to weed out the black sheep really , it 's pretty straight forward . 
346290:30	###It 's my job to weed out the black sheep really , it 's pretty straight forward . ###But you must get borderline cases from time to time . 
346389:90	###I think you expect me to spell everything out , oh , just hang on for a moment will you Barbara , fine . ###Thank you Tony . 
346536:7	###Tell him the bits that he does do right . ###Right . 
346538:7	###There must be something . ###Pardon ? 
346602:35	###I do apologise for this noise . ###Start at the end . 
346658:21	###Yes , of course , I understand Mr. Lewis . ###She did n't quite get my drift did she ? 
346661:15	###What are they ? ###To see that each of her catering units operates to the highest standard possible while balancing our clients ' requirements against profitability with due regard to company policy . 
346699:43	###Oh right . ###So the first lesson in organising your staff successfully is to define their responsibilities , tell them what they 're there for . 
346722:52	###Woolly management of the worst kind . ###Er , a substitute for thought and no help to anyone . 
346757:38	###Let 's imagine that you 're an effective one . ###Now these are the minimum standards we expect from our salesmen . 
346794:15	###It worked quite well , ###Speak for yourself , 
346842:27	###If I could have all the managers and all the observers , please . ###If you could come out , and out of the room with me . 
346846:12	###You 've got er , a sh , a T , we knew it was a T , but it could turn to different shapes , ###No I did n't do that one 
346850:27	###The object of that was do n't assume that people have got a sign for , you know . ###The beauty of having to describe a shape . 
346851:9	###The beauty of having to describe a shape . ###And as they 're describing it , you had to draw it . 
346904:121	###Here 's the , to go on . ###It can be anything real or imaginary . 
346904:161	###Here 's the , to go on . ###It can be anything real or imaginary . 
346998:9	###Because it , it 's terrifying looking at a blank piece of paper when we needed ways to start the comment . ###yes 
347001:17	###They all had an input , and Tracy kept them a lot . ###Erm , as I say , she 's like , she 's very democratic , and she 's always asking them what they felt how , how they felt they should tackle it , I mean They had n't decided what the message should be 
347112:22	###We did , yes . ###yes 
347131:12	###Okay then , let 's leave that there , and then talked about that at tea , and you can have a talk about it then . ###Come on Ian . 
347161:42	###Yes , the vast majority ? ###How do you go about that , and what sort of things do you delegate ? 
347170:38	###Okay , does that , and you find that that works well ? ###Mm , very well . 
347172:138	###Er , what kind of checks to do have , do you have to keep on that ? ###About once every week I 'll check that everything 's been done . 
347235:91	###Reactive , yes . ###Can you erm , explain what a reactive task is , Tracy ? 
347235:116	###Reactive , yes . ###Can you erm , explain what a reactive task is , Tracy ? 
347237:92	###It 's something you have n't got planned into your day , is n't it , it 's something that comes up , and you , you have to respond to it , so you have to have time between the day , to be able to do those things . ###Okay , can you give an example ? 
347268:62	###They are things that you do which actually improve your department both in the short and in the long-term . ###The long-term specifically . 
347302:13	###It 's to be done A S A P . ###What about important ? 
347309:20	###No , because things come up unexpectedly , so things will become urgent that maybe you did n't think were important , but have just suddenly emerged . ###Do you know what I mean ? 
347312:193	###The whole day 's important is n't it ? ###The whole day 's important . 
347313:117	###The whole day 's important . ###Yes , everything , a lot of things are important , and what you 're saying is true Alex , that if you do the important things when you should do them , they wo n't become urgent , but equally what Tracy says is that , is true is that you will get unexpected things cropping up where you have to drop everything . 
347324:97	###Can things be both urgent and important . ###What can you think of that possibly is ? 
347359:26	###It 's just an everyday task . ###I would agree with you yes , 
347390:70	###Yes , I agreed . ###Okay , we 've got two issues here . 
347414:56	###If you get your books right , it 'll all happen on the shopfloor . ###Say that again ? 
347429:28	###There are certain things like active , that I actually do throughout the branch as well . ###I mean I could quite easily delegate it out , but I ca n't because it 's a management function , so , I 've got to be the one that 's got to walk round the branch for half an hour , taking twelve blocks off , checking all the sealed . 
347448:9	###No , not necessarily , no , an active task is something that takes your department forward , actively improves the way your department runs , which could be something like . ###Would be suitable by anybody 's standard whether locally or by er centrally do n't volunteer either because they find working with councillors and local officials particularly in recent years when local authorities have become much more party political and that 's been a pity , or the suitable people are too busy running their own businesses . 
347449:35	###Would be suitable by anybody 's standard whether locally or by er centrally do n't volunteer either because they find working with councillors and local officials particularly in recent years when local authorities have become much more party political and that 's been a pity , or the suitable people are too busy running their own businesses . ###So I have to say that though I at this moment very close to this in the smallest county of England I have also had experience in three other major counties in mainland England er and I have found the same experience the difficulty of finding people who will even be councillors or magistrates , let alone these other jobs that the er that the er Home Secretary seeks to find . 
347453:277	###Hear ! ###Hear ! 
347466:147	###We 've had a an expose if that 's the right word of the method of appointing them , but from my own experience in my own area , where are they going to come from , what functions are they going to carry out ? ###Well now I 've been clearing my mind on the role of the Chief Constable a and of the Police Committee . 
347466:161	###We 've had a an expose if that 's the right word of the method of appointing them , but from my own experience in my own area , where are they going to come from , what functions are they going to carry out ? ###Well now I 've been clearing my mind on the role of the Chief Constable a and of the Police Committee . 
347468:8	###What is for sure on the basis of a judgment made in nineteen sixty-eight when my Noble friend Lord Callaghan of Cardiff er was Home Secretary , it was made quite clear that no Minister of the Crown can tell a Chief Constable , can tell him he must or mee no or must not keep observation on this place or that . ###I wonder whether that has been carried out to the letter on one or two occasions in the last ten years . 
347468:12	###What is for sure on the basis of a judgment made in nineteen sixty-eight when my Noble friend Lord Callaghan of Cardiff er was Home Secretary , it was made quite clear that no Minister of the Crown can tell a Chief Constable , can tell him he must or mee no or must not keep observation on this place or that . ###I wonder whether that has been carried out to the letter on one or two occasions in the last ten years . 
347475:104	###What are these appointees to do ? ###What are they supposed to do ? 
347524:24	###There is considerable evidence to show that it is partnerships between the various departments of local authorities , voluntary agencies and the police working together which are most likely to curb crime and improve the quality of life in c in local communities . ###If that is to happen however , I believe My Lords that it is essential that local authorities should feel that they have a real contribution to make in the policing of their areas . 
347528:47	###Hear ! ###Hear ! 
347540:7	###My Lords , I very much hope that my Noble friend Lord Fellows , the Minister will feel able to er take the advice of my Noble friend Lord Wrenton er for a particular er and it is not quite the same reason as his . ###Er My Lords I do not see within this of amendments the answers that we want , I see two or three narrow misses . 
347541:161	###Er My Lords I do not see within this of amendments the answers that we want , I see two or three narrow misses . ###We have to answer an er your Lordships are in danger of getting into the mood of treating this debate as a charge with a single issue to be decided on a single voter . 
347558:108	###I think too that we should reflect upon who it is that receives the blame er when policing falls below the standards which we would all think appropriate . ###We seldom read in the tabloid press local police force fails er we may frequently read in the local press in the tabloid press rather , that the Home Secretary has failed and yet what we seem to be saying is that we believe that all the responsibility should be local , all that responsibility , all the blame when things go wrong should go to the Home Secretary . 
347564:96	###In terms of er political views , or even those who have no political views , of ethnic make-up and everything of this kind and yet now it seems that at a time when our police forces above all , need to move into the present day and prepare themselves for the challenges of the crime and the criminals at the end of this century and into the next century , we seem to have some misgivings about giving the Home Secretary the powers which are placed in this Bill . ###I doubt if that is so I think to some extent we may be in what we are saying and doing , feeding the current which says that nobody in national politics could conceivably be honest or decent or competent in any way whatsoever , that to be a Member of the House of Commons or to be a Member of the Government is somehow to have the mark of put upon them . 
347568:61	###I think if I may say so My Lords , we 're becoming slightly over-excited . ###That 's quite different from Amendment Number Twenty Seven . 
347613:117	###We did get through some pretty hot language , erm he did say that this would destroy the tripartite system and he quoted me and said that I said it was a system which was the end of the world . ###That 's perfectly true , it is a system of the end of the world and my only consc my only complaint is that I do n't think that what my Right Honourable Friend is suggesting is in fact a destruction of the tripartite system . 
347617:39	###We are talking about the tripartite system , the Home Secretary , the Police Authority and the Chief Constable . ###That as it were milkman 's stool with three legs and each of them has a certain amount of power and it is a question of the adjustment of that power and it is not the of the power to my Right Honourable Friend , the Home Secretary and yet when things go wrong , and they do , in police forces and in local auth police authorities , what happens , people turn round to the Home Secretary and say what are you going to do about it . 
347639:46	###Hear ! ###Hear ! 
347656:62	###Er Lord Elton in favour of a local authority majority . ###Lord Tenby in favour of a local authority majority and c and co-option . 
347659:7	###Hear ! ###Hear ! 
347695:143	###Ken erm y you 've asked some questions , I 've actually seen the I M R O letter and can I say that there are two questions in the I M R O letter to Mr Maxwell and Bishopsgate , which quite categorically asked for accounts and also details of the ownership structure coming out of Liechtenstein . ###I have n't seen the re final reply that went from er the Maxwell organisation to er I M R O but I did see a draft reply . 
347743:157	###So that so that actual that particular settlement was rather a good one , because it was thirty odd million plus eight was n't it ? ###Ken , would you say though that erm one or two recent announcements connected with these judgments , I think including the er the judge in a recent M C C case which actually went I think against the administrators , b on shares but actually the judge said if the argument had been made that er these assets were held er on a trustee basis , then I might have made a different decision . 
347747:20	###It was , can I just bring you back to that point ###Yes . 
347781:84	###No the erm none of your papers to the committee concentrated on the the compensation er proposals from the Good report , and as you know it 's a scheme er which is proposed to be restric restricted to losses ari arising from fraud , theft and intentional misappropriation of assets and is just up to a limit of ninety per cent . ###How do you consider that the proposals for that scheme offer adequate cover er to members of pension schemes ? 
347782:116	###How do you consider that the proposals for that scheme offer adequate cover er to members of pension schemes ? ###No we do n't , erm we in principle obviously we are in favour of er there being some form of compensation scheme and that has to be regarded as erm a step forward , er it would be better if er whatever compensation scheme is gonna be introduced was introduced now and the committee recommended and not in nineteen ninety-six or whenever it may be that the legislation is enacted . 
347782:156	###How do you consider that the proposals for that scheme offer adequate cover er to members of pension schemes ? ###No we do n't , erm we in principle obviously we are in favour of er there being some form of compensation scheme and that has to be regarded as erm a step forward , er it would be better if er whatever compensation scheme is gonna be introduced was introduced now and the committee recommended and not in nineteen ninety-six or whenever it may be that the legislation is enacted . 
347782:185	###How do you consider that the proposals for that scheme offer adequate cover er to members of pension schemes ? ###No we do n't , erm we in principle obviously we are in favour of er there being some form of compensation scheme and that has to be regarded as erm a step forward , er it would be better if er whatever compensation scheme is gonna be introduced was introduced now and the committee recommended and not in nineteen ninety-six or whenever it may be that the legislation is enacted . 
347808:206	###We believe it should be . ###Could , could erm , I ask you then how you think it should be funded ? 
347811:106	###We believe that it would be more sensible if a proportion of the compensation would be met by people like pension fund managers if for no other reason that it would encourage them to er keep their own house in order erm and you know it 's not a bad er principle to operate in these areas . ###Now you know , wi with lots of experts in this field and so we ' re we only simply put that forward as a , a general suggestion whether it should be one-third from them and two- thirds from the pension funds , you know , I do n't think is a matter of great importance to us , but we do think that the should perhaps be a bit spread , spread a bit more widely than just into the pension funds . 
347816:120	###H how would you balance that out back to the date that you 're talking about ? ###Well 
347818:48	###W w w we can see , you can visualise from now if we start it now , you 'd say well , everyone now knows that if anything goes wrong , this is what they will have to pay , but how are you going to take it back ? ###Well actually , no , I I I would disagree with you at the moment . 
347819:63	###Well actually , no , I I I would disagree with you at the moment . ###If something goes wrong , they do n't know what they are going to have to pay because if I 'm a pension fund manager now , I do n't know what is likely to happen in the next year which is going call on me for compensation . 
347832:169	###I thought you were trying to actually pin responsibility not to organisations , but to people that here was Mrs Thatchers philosophy really working and market was gonna discipline pay out their own pockets . ###Now if I 'm the fund manager and you 've gotta deferred member , nobody 's gonna waste thirty years for me to pay up their pension , I wo n't be here probably in thirty years time er so they want the money up front . 
347834:167	###They do n't want me paying d you know like their pension deferred , so if you 're serious about the fu pension fund managers paying , we 're talking y you know earlier you said four hundred and eighty million whatever it is lost , they 're paying a third , pension fund managers have got to come up with that sort of sum . ###Now that seems to me , that might induce er slightly might do , but I could I I think that , wha I what I thought you were saying was different from what you ended up saying and I 'm not sure which 
347855:93	###Er financial institution is sure to meet its position , it comes to the pension fund says can you loan me th this stock in the return of which I will er pay you the equivalent sum of money plus some interest . ###That sounds all very well and good , the way as my reading of the at least one of the writs is concerned is that er Maxwell operated this in entirely the reverse . 
347902:15	###And we 're also saying that if you have a new pensions act , the work of the regulator will be much easier . ###Why ? 
347925:135	###Yes , the reason why we picked a forty year lifespan of work or working life er with four tens was because Professor Good himself told us that er on their research the common employment pattern today is in fact four employers over the working life and of course that is very different from the experience of many pensioners who are drawing today from their pension funds , because many of them were long-term , long-service employees throughout their lives with one employer . ###But you were saying were n't you you described this world which lots of us now have lost and somebody leaving school starting a job and retiring from that job , so the que the question David 's asked you is more important is n't it because deferred pensions are probably gonna become more , not less common . 
347925:210	###Yes , the reason why we picked a forty year lifespan of work or working life er with four tens was because Professor Good himself told us that er on their research the common employment pattern today is in fact four employers over the working life and of course that is very different from the experience of many pensioners who are drawing today from their pension funds , because many of them were long-term , long-service employees throughout their lives with one employer . ###But you were saying were n't you you described this world which lots of us now have lost and somebody leaving school starting a job and retiring from that job , so the que the question David 's asked you is more important is n't it because deferred pensions are probably gonna become more , not less common .

348000:53	###Erm if my reading of Locke erm differs from that of most of my erm fellow historians and political thought erm it differs in a matter of emphasis . ###Erm I think that Locke 's theology erm plays a much more crucial role in his thinking than many of my colleagues think and I mention this because er you might note this as a possible bias that you might like to take account of in reading Locke . 
348081:56	###Well Locke 's contemporaries would know exactly what he meant in the late seventeenth century . ###This was the age of political oath taking and I think it highly likely that Locke was thinking of , for example , the Test Act of sixteen seventy three . 
348081:81	###Well Locke 's contemporaries would know exactly what he meant in the late seventeenth century . ###This was the age of political oath taking and I think it highly likely that Locke was thinking of , for example , the Test Act of sixteen seventy three . 
348120:17	###I find that Locke does n't really address this point . ###Erm okay as British we all form a single civil society , now Locke wants to say that we can act , for example , erm we can change the form of our government and we can do this independently of the government itself . 
348199:61	###And any of you who have been to the United States may have experienced this . ###If you drive from er I remember being stopped by one of those men in the dark glasses erm if you drive from Maine into New Hampshire the speed limit in Maine is sixty five and the speed limit in New Hampshire is fifty five and you just cross a si er y there 's a signpost which says welcome to Maine or New Hampshire , whichever way you 're going , and the second you cross that line , theoretically , you have adjust to the different speed limit . 
348204:89	###So you could literally have a situation in which you could live say er er a woman could er live er you know a mile from the state line and in one state er abortion er could be something which ended up with a doctor in prison for life , in another state , across the state line , it could be something which was er you know er provided free of charge by the state public health authorities . ###So wide fluctuations , entirely different er codes . 
348219:35	###So if you take er another example erm most American states , the majority , have er a sales tax of some sort , equivalent to VAT as we would call it , er most of them have a property tax , equivalent to rates or council tax or whatever you want to call it now , er and the majority have an income tax as well , a state income tax . ###So they have a wide tax base and they can generate large sums of money if they , if they choose to do so and in different states there 's a different culture , a different attitude towards public spending and taxation and so on . 
348228:206	###Erm you know there is no doubt in our system of government that the power is highly centralized and that local government is seen as a , a possible convenience well a public convenience probably erm something ###something we 
348232:47	###In the United States the , one of the impacts of federalism and the size of the United States and its diversity , is that politicians in America are all local . ###Everything is local in America . 
348262:101	###So in financial terms the local authorities are entirely virtually in the pocket , literally in the pocket of central government . ###And because he had a very happy turn of phrase , Ron , he said that the states had become federal aid junkies . 
348276:200	###They actually taxed their own populations more to keep public services at , at the level they were before . ###So it was n't the fact that he 'd cut back on government it 's just that the government came , the spending came at a different er point in the , in the political structure . 
348276:231	###They actually taxed their own populations more to keep public services at , at the level they were before . ###So it was n't the fact that he 'd cut back on government it 's just that the government came , the spending came at a different er point in the , in the political structure . 
348277:174	###So it was n't the fact that he 'd cut back on government it 's just that the government came , the spending came at a different er point in the , in the political structure . ###So erm what I 'm trying to say here then is that the federal government is important , the federal government tries wherever possible to guide states into , into good practice and it offers rewards to states to comply with , with federal er guidelines so that , you know , if you want federal aid for er a particular project you have to , if you accept federal money , you have to ensure that you meet certain standards or certain conditions , but a very convenient way of enforcing civil rights er policies . 
348285:50	###Sad tale of the runaway slave and so on , separated from his family and his children and he runs away ###and they er as in many countries erm there is a very high incidence of er of death through death driving erm amongst young people and in America each state has a different er age in which you 're allowed to consume alcohol . 
348337:103	###In other words we were , we were considerably concerned about the extent of the war . ###Now you can see what would have happened if McArthur 's advice had , had been followed . 
348348:34	###And the context in which this was er argued er was er the Bay of Pigs invasion of Cuba , a C I A American supported invasion , er which er failed very badly but which certainly indicated the American desire to get rid of Castro and er Khrushchev was asserting in effect that he had as much right to defend an ally as the United States had er to defend erm its allies and in the same sort of way . ###Now Kennedy had a dilemma although Cuba was in the Caribbean , and although the United States had the biggest navy in the world , and the biggest airforce and was easily able to exterminate Cuba if it wa if it wished to , it was vulnerable , however , in other areas , in particular it was vulnerable in Berlin and it was vulnerable in Indo-China . 
348685:43	###And all the crofters then that was paying rent . ###In those days how many people were actually involved on the estate ? 
348686:7	###In those days how many people were actually involved on the estate ? ###Well there was a lot of people involved on the estate because they had to repair paths . 
348686:69	###In those days how many people were actually involved on the estate ? ###Well there was a lot of people involved on the estate because they had to repair paths . 
348763:121	###Then after the the well there 's er the library as they called it was lined with books leather bound books great big kidney shaped oak table and beautiful chairs there and we used it as the office you know for the principal keeper did his returns and all the rest of it there . ###And er then er after that there was the gun room or the magazine where they stored the ammunition for the gun and er then the light room . 
348792:50	###Went twelve miles from us to . ###Er some navi navigators aboard that boat . 
348832:87	###There 's one small landing you can er you can do in the in the west landing they called it . ###Er they you can very fine day you can make a relief there . 
348832:191	###There 's one small landing you can er you can do in the in the west landing they called it . ###Er they you can very fine day you can make a relief there . 
348837:37	###But there was three months er commissioners put three months supply of what they called iron rations onto the rock . ###Er a bowl of flour and er and er so many kists of bully beef and er I think that was about all they they supplied er which was n't taken . 
348838:45	###Er a bowl of flour and er and er so many kists of bully beef and er I think that was about all they they supplied er which was n't taken . ###But we if we used a tin of bully beef we had to supply that tin of bully beef out of our own seven and six pence . 
348838:83	###Er a bowl of flour and er and er so many kists of bully beef and er I think that was about all they they supplied er which was n't taken . ###But we if we used a tin of bully beef we had to supply that tin of bully beef out of our own seven and six pence . 
348912:24	###The man was n't watching the light room he saw smoke coming up under the so he went away down and there was a fire in a in the er in the library . ###And er of course he alerted the other two fellows and there were no fighting there was only about two little fire extinguishers on the tower . 
348913:33	###And er of course he alerted the other two fellows and there were no fighting there was only about two little fire extinguishers on the tower . ###And er there were well they had to get water up from the from the bottom t ladder in pails and three men er with pails trying to and of course they could n't fight it . 
348996:43	###So those are the some of the physical properties . ###Have fairly high melting points . 
349124:10	###The current of the electricity . ###Good . 
349372:42	###where we can pick up some marks . ###Now tell me what erm what sort of preparation you did for this . 
349550:28	###Mm . ###The equations they will give you in the book are in that one . 
349651:19	###Yes , good answer . ###Take it to an expert who 'll tell you what 's happening . 
349651:42	###Yes , good answer . ###Take it to an expert who 'll tell you what 's happening . 
349863:38	###Five year apprenticeship yes and er it was more or less labourer work you were just a boy and run and did messages and carried whatever the journeymen bakers wanted . ###Er you did n't really start thinking seriously about being a baker until about your last year of your apprenticeship . 
349867:9	###Went to a night school in Fountain Bridge . ###And if you had a complete attendance you got your er you got your fee back again from the from . 
349894:65	###Yes . ###Very little very few apprentices were sacked unless through misdemeanour or anything but if you done your work you were there to as long as you you liked . 
349898:9	###The the thing that er sticks out is that at time there was no women organizing the union and er I had a go at organizing the women and I was very successful . ###Because at the end of the day we had a hundred percent women in the union in that bakery . 
349903:7	###And they loved the national agreement . ###How long did it take to establish that did it take you a long time to ? 
349911:104	###In these days they were feared of their job . ###There was unemployment going about and the man that had a certain job at making certain things were n't to keen to show the apprentice what to do or give them the recipes . 
349924:64	###That was er more or less the compartment that I worked in . ###They had other compartments where it was only bread and other compartments where it was just confectionery . 
349924:87	###That was er more or less the compartment that I worked in . ###They had other compartments where it was only bread and other compartments where it was just confectionery . 
349946:67	###So you were working eight er eight hours six days a week ? ###Eight hours six days a work that 's right . 
349960:9	###Plain bread was a different matter . ###It comes through the comes through the machines and moulded . 
349972:22	###Compared to the pan bread there 's a crust all round it . ###That was er that was the process of bread . 
350022:9	###They so it could be five pound now for the responsibility I do n't know . ###But it was a very responsible job because if you got an oven for your stuff and you burnt that boy there 's a lot of waste . 
350064:23	###So if you were in the and you were forty years of age you were n't safe for going to the to go to the army . ###Well er continuing on bakery the bottom floor which was a break making plan . 
350068:24	###Now the squad that worked down there when anybody left there was nobody would take their place . ###Because they did n't want to work under these conditions . 
350086:87	###The the dues was deducted of their wages so therefore why should they go to meetings . ###They had n't they had no er inherent right to make resolutions or ask for increase in wages that was all done at conference by their their representatives . 
350086:97	###The the dues was deducted of their wages so therefore why should they go to meetings . ###They had n't they had no er inherent right to make resolutions or ask for increase in wages that was all done at conference by their their representatives . 
350111:15	###The despatch was complaining that the stuff was late . ###Well you either left the line for me to try two or three mixes for custom purposes . 
350142:18	###I think it was forty six forty seven forty er forty six forty five forty four . ###They come down that way . 
350153:24	###Compared with these big electric rollers . ###But the however we got by and it was a very progressive wee bakery . 
350214:11	###They met with the branch and discussed it with them and told them how it was out of order . ###And usually that was accepted . 
350238:64	###Because as soon as the national agreement come into being our our of the meetings dropped down dropped down dropped down until there were very few attending . ###And I think the reason for that was because they did n't have a say in what was happening . 
350239:30	###And I think the reason for that was because they did n't have a say in what was happening . ###Now to take you back to when you were on the committee representing what kind of complaints did you have to get there ? 
350241:15	###Well one of the commonest complaints that we had to deal with was er when your time was up at twelve o' clock you they usually kept you working until about five or ten past twelve . ###That that was a regular thing and er that was unpaid of course . 
350308:12	###Yes ###but we 'll go back again . 
350424:10	###but there you are , that 's how it goes , anyway I hope to see you ###Right 
350569:95	###Have a , take as much as you like , there 's another packet there ###Oh right , that 'll do me I think , thank you . 
350577:32	###Oh yeah , aha ###how long ago , I mean how long has it been there ? 
350577:37	###Oh yeah , aha ###how long ago , I mean how long has it been there ? 
350578:9	###how long ago , I mean how long has it been there ? ###Erm , nearly twelve years I think now , no must , must be more than that 
350734:9	###Mm So when did you first come back for leave , on leave ? ###Erm 
350786:13	###Er , are you ready for tea or ? ###Yes please , mm , mm 
350803:25	###local preachers . ###Where did your ministers go for training ? 
350882:7	###Oh , oh ###Mm 
350893:38	###Very bad ###erm 
351113:85	###And of course , our discussion of ministry i.e. the activity of the people of God is not just a domestic thing about the URC . ###I mean , we we get bound up with with all sorts of domestic things , and will , I expect , later today . 
351132:23	###I 'll say at the outset , that Holy Communion is not something that we play about with . ###Our communion service is part of the rich tradition which has been passed down to us from Jesus Christ . 
351159:79	###Like it is n't you know that the Eucharist , er the the the communion is very central to our worship and having had ten years working at the Navy that was an eye opener and deepening of my own spiritual awareness in the , as in the sanctity that I got , the sacrament and how other churches see it and er helped to create a very affirm , at the very centre of my own if you like , pilgrimage . ###What had abhorred me in the past and sometimes , er , perhaps arrive and been to the church and say , oh by the way it 's communion ! 
351314:42	###But not , at any time , in the context of the church . ###A number of us went to that presentation the minister , the church secretary , myself , and the treasurer at the time and a few of the elders . 
351316:7	###We listened and learned that if the church is to grow it must consider all its resources ! ###Reference to that again this morning . 
351436:34	###It was a simple story , and I would of forgotten it er , about a woman struggling to bring up a family in a depression . ###The story was that her husband in the deep south was killed by some young hoodlums who were black . 
351549:29	###Well you see , like like . ###Exactly ! 
351551:20	###Yes well erm we 're still going to have to talk about it with the elders you see . ###Sorry , what did you say ? 
351623:9	###Erm I do n't know what the situation will be in the other churches . ###Mm . 
351707:15	###Well that seems to be the mood . ###Well what the church meeting 's got to decide 
351712:4	###But erm on the other hand we we 've gotta try , as a group of elders to come together I ###Mm . 
351806:52	###But I think that came through in this morning 's conversation . ###And I 'm glad also to to to greeting , it 's my last part John , if you 'd like to know ! 
351850:61	###Yes , but I 'll try to be brief . ###As I understand things , and I work from what I know to what I do n't know anyone ordained an elder following these guidelines is recognised as an elder within the United Reform Church and within the Presbyterian Church of Wales . 
351883:50	###We . ###We move to page five , the top half of page five and and Graham will introduce the world famous issue . 
351940:24	###Delegates from the member churches . ###And , in a sense the World Council of Churches at this point can be regarded as the supreme legislative body of the World Church . 
351941:50	###And , in a sense the World Council of Churches at this point can be regarded as the supreme legislative body of the World Church . ###And you 're quite right er we must regard the World Church as meaning ourselves .

351952:94	###And then , the fourth assembly er , was held in Loopsala Sw in Sweden and the fifth assembly was er , held in Nairobi . ###And then er , the sixth assembly in Vancouver in nineteen eight three and the seventh assembly in Canberra , last year . 
351978:83	###But all these statements revealed the desire of the assembly to pray more ardently for the spirit of unity to reconcile people . ###Indeed , this was a very rare opportunity for all delegates and visitors , as I said , to meet to listen yes , and to hear it first hand about the life and witness of more than three hundred member churches throughout the world in a hundred countries ! 
351983:135	###If you had read this I should n't be here this afternoon ! ###But are we going to inflict that on you ? 
351997:9	###But first of all the global situation in the Gulf . ###This marred the peace situation ! 
352032:27	###The culture of the minorities of indigenous people that was given providence at the assembly . ###And this was expressed in a very imaginative presentation by Professor a young in her keynote lecture when she called for three significant changes . 
352033:18	###And this was expressed in a very imaginative presentation by Professor a young in her keynote lecture when she called for three significant changes . ###The first was that for our generation we must learn how to live with the earth promoting harmony sustainability and diversity and , therefore , creation , spirituality was the keynote of the address .

352048:31	###May I make one or two observations and then I 'll finish . ###On the whole , the assembly gave us and understanding of the worldwide church which was struggling to achieve reconciliation and to promote peace and justice . 
352089:14	###Er , if you have not had a copy of this sent to you what I have said to them , by what I say afterwards erm it will be worth purchasing . ###My question ha , again another question , how do you make the Lord interesting ? 
352095:9	###And registration may be denied anyone who has been convicted of any certain types of offense . ###It 's the responsibility of the local authority to ensure that all those leading groups are people of good standing . 
352097:29	###The church must make every effort to achieve the highest standards . ###And the church as bible road to fame in alerting us to our responsibilities . 
352105:89	###An introduction that is important . ###There are a number ar , of areas in the ma state legislation that have been aligned to the church , or will affect the running of the church . 
352129:156	###Thank you . ###And I I , I hope that I , I hope there 's a good variety of people will again , as you always have done will turn up er , this year to share fellowship a , on this theme which er , is is a refresh theme I think for , for many of us . 
352187:10	###High notes ! ###Very good ! 
352187:26	###High notes ! ###Very good ! 
352193:73	###But then ###That will be , it is thousand so that 's er that 's three thousand four hundred short of a four by sixty . 
352194:60	###That will be , it is thousand so that 's er that 's three thousand four hundred short of a four by sixty . ###And what the difference is that er , we thought that you could have one young person per district and that they only have to pay thirty two pounds each , but I think these are only purely

352196:43	###Yes , er , I have them for those who received that incorrect information from me , I must apologise erm young people who are going as delegates as representatives of their district must be treated as adult representatives and they have to pay full price . ###Er for , for people who are going to group and and , for any young people who are going observers there are special arrangements to be made which does n't relate to our official represented district , I 'm sorry about that ! 
352213:185	###So , er , we 're getting people saying it 's impossible to pay this even though they were asked if they could pay it at the the the time it was given sometime last July . ###Well that 's one the other reason , of course we have got a large number of chur , very small churches in fact , looking at our mai , ministry figures nineteen ninety there were thirty churches that did n't pay anything to the maintenance and a lot of these , I think , maybe 
352218:21	###So , the , the other thing which is er erm , a real problem , partly because of that , is , is when one talks about an increase in in giving , increase in percentage i , or a contribution of the church is in er , we were talking about twenty percent la , twenty one percent last year that would be alright if everybody gave twenty one percent ! ###Those who did nothing , they can eas , easily increase their giving by twenty one percent , it 's still the same ! 
352225:62	###and are doing their best to do it . ###So that 's on the down side . 
352240:91	###There seem to be our two groups er , in one of our provinces and they say that the rich and poor but the rich er er are not so rich and others . ###That , in fact , er there are three provinces who are already now contributing more than anyone else that , they feel that the churches should go forward to try and raise the minister 's to what was proposedly that the assembly last year , they should be paid thirteen thousand two hundred but in order to do that see another six hundred thousand pound raised and it is likely that this will be put as a challenge to the churches at assembly .

352254:110	###I think so , yes . ###Yes . 
352319:30	###Oh ! ###Erm in order to meet a commitment which is the same as this year commitment then last here increasing last year because this year 's commitment we will not reach this year therefore , we 'll be into deficit ! 
352319:87	###Oh ! ###Erm in order to meet a commitment which is the same as this year commitment then last here increasing last year because this year 's commitment we will not reach this year therefore , we 'll be into deficit ! 
352337:127	###And that is as one of the members of , we have a I think we can afford to have member on the finance of churches who are called at the assembly of the URC who er ###Good , yes ! 
352371:27	###Because we hear great erm shouts , cackulations of joy from those provinces that can afford to increase their giving should n't allow us to sit on our morals ! ###I think it 's a great tragedy that Wales considers itself to be the poor relation within the United Reform Church and the answer can only lie within Wales ! 
352384:120	###Now , clearly if you were paid say six hundred pounds for that and you only did twelve hundred miles , you 're getting fifty P a mile anyway ! ###And they 've got , I think the odds are that people are giving more perhaps er and that er , if they were paid at fifty four P per mile and and got how that would affect the churches er contributions they make ? 
352529:7	###You will have tea at half past four which is which is er splendid ! ###There are a couple of things I would like to say one is that you will find people have asked regards the paper which David mentioned in Northern Ireland that has been distributed it was pinned to another sheet of paper erm , headed The Last Attempt and there are more copies available it 's simply to know where to find that . 
352564:7	###Shall we settle down ! ###Shall we settle down ! 
352638:24	###He 's now our guardian all our lives , for every and . ###God his name and if thy name for carry him in every heart and . 
352639:8	###God his name and if thy name for carry him in every heart and . ###he has bless my Lord and we must . 
352682:24	###Well that 's . ###Just once , and then we 're going . 
352960:7	###I ###everybody in ! 
352967:12	###I was taught that when I worked in the grocery warehouse . ###If you open a box with a penknife always do that . 
353123:4	###I have n't got his work number on the memory so I 'll ###Right . 
353196:14	###Mm . ###erm it will it reads the clock automatically . 
353313:38	###Make a sub- directory as . ###Make as sub-directory as WP papers . 
353465:32	###D-base is what ? ###Five at the moment . 
353476:10	###I could probably re-name them ? ###To make it easier to remember , except it maybe it refers to it , maybe it uses book something to refer to them . 
353533:17	###this advert went on the back of it . ###So if anybody locally wanted . 
353545:31	###If you have two sides it 'll be quite a few wo n't it ? ###And sixty copies will be three pound . 
353682:91	###And the ###Mm . 
353778:12	###Yes . ###Some of them being too large . 
353779:18	###Some of them being too large . ###But we 've had to bear with it . 
353809:63	###No but as erm Mrs has mentioned to me , when it comes to er converting an existing garage into a den or a study and then asking for another garage to be built . ###Well you know , it 's not good enough is it ? 
353928:7	###but usually once one gets sort of started it it gets better . ###And he , he possibly had done it at least a half a dozen times 
353935:9	###So he 's done it before . ###And and lots of churches that he was telling us that he 'd been in contact with . 
353974:7	###a recommendation to the church you see , so I ###Erm 
353974:31	###a recommendation to the church you see , so I ###Erm 
354037:15	###Who was put on a spot . ###Erm and as you said he , he could n't leave his notes . 
354043:18	###Yeah . ###Erm there was the whole time a sense of anxiety about him . 
354044:45	###Erm there was the whole time a sense of anxiety about him . ###Alright he knew he had to go to afterwards , half past three , but he could n't unwind one bit there . 
354044:66	###Erm there was the whole time a sense of anxiety about him . ###Alright he knew he had to go to afterwards , half past three , but he could n't unwind one bit there . 
354055:12	###Yes . ###Yes erm you see we 're in a different , different situation than what you are at Salisbury Park . 
354057:14	###We have n't had to make a demand upon our congregation to make such a decision for twenty two or twenty five years you see ? ###Mm . 
354119:12	###I would say the second is the more important . ###The more important being a good pastor .

520058:63	###And is n't that how the congregation is ? ###Some of us seemed to be awkward and the truth , new and the truth , inexperienced , others seemed to be so polished do n't they ? 
520071:4	###I was just gonna say , some sometimes , I have n't been for a bit mind you , oh , well the last time I went , sometimes I go to Wales to Blaenau Ffestiniog or to congregation ###Mm

520201:12	###does n't it , right ###Oh it 's only first names anyway 
520217:9	###and then I hear him back , he says that he 's got great faith to believe the truth , know the truth , mhm , mm ###Oh , I can see you 're getting me baffled this morning 
520225:7	###Not initially no ###No 
520272:11	###See we , if I can just say Mark now , you and I know this truth , pe pe people in the world generally do n't know what you and I know do they ? ###That 's why the 
520290:36	###Somehow or other ###Yes , that 's 
520292:4	###it 's sort of in relation to it , there must of been some reason why he said that to take them to , hear more to other people ###Yes 
520303:26	###Exactly , Jesus was saying to this officer that I 'll cure your master when I get there ###Mm 
520328:7	###faith which he had ? ###Yeah , well 
520330:79	###There must of been some particular reason why , why , why he mentioned that , which maybe might be difficult to try and realize ###Yes I can see your point Mark I see 
520330:92	###There must of been some particular reason why , why , why he mentioned that , which maybe might be difficult to try and realize ###Yes I can see your point Mark I see 
520334:7	###Mm , in other words why did , why did he continue in chapter eleven go on about there will be many in eastern parts will come and required at the table or in other words in the kingdom ###Yeah 
520364:37	###Mm ###and everybody will have an opportunity of learning about that kingdom 
520419:54	###Mm ###he 's only got erm , well I mean provisions and store for those whose artist complete towards them 
520423:37	###which proves that it would n't be easy to get in there anyway , so ###No 
520429:7	###it is n't like an immortal soul which is sort of given automatically ###That 's right , yeah 
520466:55	###because ###says to him , but we 're not blind also are we ? 
520468:58	###And then he replied that well just because you think you 're not blind , then you must be ###Mm 
520489:13	###No it 's alright , keep talking ###Mm 
520492:52	###Mm ###if , if they refuse , well that 's , that 's a choice they have is n't it ? 
520498:29	###Mm , yeah , the , all the scriptures from then on even are all pointed out to achieve this heavenly thing ###Yes 
520505:46	###and erm in erm , speaking about it however and in mentioning about the scriptures which referring about them ###Mm , most of them do do n't they ? 
520531:45	###Mm ###and these ones will be made up , er faithful ones from , taken from Jesus ' 
520531:63	###Mm ###and these ones will be made up , er faithful ones from , taken from Jesus ' 
520562:37	###colourful visions ###oh lots of visions were , were had by 
520567:41	###Yes they were , yes ###They , they were er , the , the 
520579:35	###one logical thing is that erm , if erm letters were sent to er , to angels , which I do n't know whether that the judges believe that , then you would n't actually need to send the literal letters to , er angels who , it because they 'd be far advanced in , in whatever they 've got ###Yes 
520583:46	###in other words if you read it without any experience you might start thinking that it 's giving you a vision of the real heaven where as it 's just symbolic ###Yes 
520616:32	###which was God 's spirit in some way ###Yes 
520630:35	###Mm , it 's alright I 've just seen a , a woman er passing a three wheeler on the pavement here , wheel chair and she was doing quite a bit of a speed , I was just gonna get my , my my speed checker ###know of her , see if she was speeding on the pavement 
520660:9	###that 's came to them ###Yes , so what act , so do you know Mark what it is that makes these people think those things ? 
520660:46	###that 's came to them ###Yes , so what act , so do you know Mark what it is that makes these people think those things ? 
520672:103	###Mm , what , the ###but , but these things 
520777:43	###It was n't something that the child automatically got ###Yes 
520787:9	###The apostle there that wrote that letter has quoted a verse from somewhere out of the Hebrew has n't he ? ###Yes 
520818:57	###Sorry watch that ###Forty five minutes left on here , mm 
520821:7	###Yes ###But also the , the being inferred to , that enlightened them on the Hebrew did n't it ? 
520821:61	###Yes ###But also the , the being inferred to , that enlightened them on the Hebrew did n't it ? 
520823:15	###It must of enlightened them on what the scriptures meant , by the sacred secret , cos before it must of been some kind of weird mystery to them ###Yes 
520838:72	###lives or is that talking about they 've approached straight line that 's already there in heaven , in other words , the , the , you know that the understanding which I have it from this bible is er that seems to be suggesting that er that 's talking about apos the apostles ' lives before they died , our spiritual lives with brightest ones who have at that er point been made perfect by being prepared to go where they 're going to ###m=Mm 
520985:59	###the truth erm , oh you never , never hold back and make be known in God 's name the kingdom , he always told the truth whether it was popular or not , that 's really , so erm come on you , are you going out with Clare , come on , hey , come on , come on Pip , go on , go on ###We 've just got this one paragraph , before we go to the next sub-heading erm , then we 'll close there shall we ? 
520998:15	###In other words ###God 's son , all our sons the same 
521000:39	###And what would Jesus have to do for that ? ###Die 
521012:15	###so how , how was it that Jesus saves us and had he , he 'd got to die for us , what , could n't he save us without dying because his death was , was n't very nice by any means ###No 
521072:105	###Yeah ###but it 
521209:15	###Do they pay for your batteries as well ? ###Oh everything , they give me a stack of batteries , they told me to change the batteries after every three tapes 
521245:10	###You know ###it 's so quiet you know this place is , it 's such a , it 's such a big place , it 's ever so quiet inside 
521271:42	###So ###Yeah .

539275:12	###Nearly twelve . ###Ooh yeah . 
539469:24	###You know like your i if you move into an army quarter you can have it fully furnished if you want , I mean ###Oh ?

540218:24	###Different ###And this one 
540740:10	###Yeah , yeah . ###So it 's erm it 's all a bit peculiar . 
540765:142	###month of December was sort of off and trying to do odd things and then she went down with this , this flu er which was progressively worse since the new year . ###Yeah , that 's right .

540842:7	###I think , I think that 's it and er tt ###You mentioned Christopher , what er the last time it 's , I 'm going back a little while , the last time I was talking with Janet he , she was a bit unhappy , I think he was in er a teaching practice at the time and she was wondering how he was going to go on . 
540899:11	###And then I say to myself oh come on , oh do n't say when I was your age I wanted did nearly or whatever . ###Say 
540930:10	###No no , that 's right . ###Yeah . 
540950:91	###Well I mean , yeah , he ###Er thinking , yeah .

541020:27	###Yes . ###Sort of on the , on the horizon for the end of the year and er I , I er do n't know how we 're going to do but erm I think the answer probably is to take a chunk at a time on the basis that erm one is n't going to be able to charge around as violently , actively as some people will .

725727:37	###You ca n't do it can you ? ###It 's not realistic . 
725834:24	###Must be going to a funeral . ###Or going for an interview . 
725870:12	###Yeah . ###and then getting all the the chassis numbers and that and welding them on to these stolen cars and Because what , you know , er Siobhan 's dad had a , bought a Montego and I do n't know how it came about but they discovered that erm it had a diff I mean it 's had a Maestro engine in it and it had this that and the other . 
725954:35	###job lot . ###And er he did n't say how much the toilet was but that 'll probably be separate . 
725973:51	###Yeah . ###How much ? 
725981:10	###Perhaps he 's just moved there . ###Mm . 
725999:18	###We reckoned that was about quarter of a page . ###It 's a lot of money is n't it ? 
726001:9	###But see the reason I have to send this to Liverpool for them to put it in ###Mhm . 
726006:12	###Mm . ###and we have the logo on the bottom and that . 
726077:5	###Yeah and the alternative you know Mi Mike 's made calls in the past . ###That 's always been very important and that should be the letter so that should be on on the , on the 
726164:7	###Was n't it did n't you ring them up and they said we have exams on or something ? ###No . 
726227:46	###village hall , church hall ###Yeah ? 
726252:17	###That would be twenty five pound a day as well , or fifty pound a day as well . ###Anyway it 's a thought . 
726263:38	###anyway ###Okay so they 're a few options to try as regards the coding 
726408:10	###Yeah . ###Now I do n't think they sound very to suit our needs . 
726412:12	###And there 's all separate , two pound a table from fifty pence to one pound fifty for a chair . ###There 's no toilet in them 
726474:54	###Ah . ###So what we , we need to go to him I think in the first instance and say we want to do X Y and Z , and if he , if he says fine you know . 
726503:91	###Yeah slow census and whatever . ###So presumably if , if Staffordshire have them made and we get those three whizzed up to Caernarvon you know , the rest can sort of fit into place . 
726543:26	###Yeah . ###Okay . 
726620:25	###Doctoring it ###Oh I see yeah . 
726652:13	###I think we need to write three letters . ###One to the police , one to the ambulance , one to the fire brigade just saying we 're proposing to do them . 
726847:23	###So I need to do that do n't I ? ###Er in fact I never gave telephone call it 's no good telling me to do something 
726959:12	###Right . ###Are they wanting a budget figure from us ? 
726992:24	###So I ###And that 's where the survey 's gonna be , right in the middle is it ? 
727037:15	###So what did she say about the money when you tried her for less money ? ###Or did n't you actually say ? 
727037:47	###So what did she say about the money when you tried her for less money ? ###Or did n't you actually say ? 
727045:72	###Yeah . ###I said do you , do you think there 'd be any discount er with it being a block booking ? 
727127:13	###What have they done , dropped their prices ? ###Well Rob 's doing them is n't he ? 
727128:10	###Well Rob 's doing them is n't he ? ###Oh they have had to drop their prices . 
727129:14	###Oh they have had to drop their prices . ###They 've had to go for the we did them a few sort of quotes on the survey side of this Arrow Park and er we 've gotta , you know , really stick to this tight budget because it 's the only way you can get them no matter what people are telling you erm about the recession being over , people still want things for nothing . 
727149:10	###And then see how long each vehicle stayed there . ###There 's two entra entrances 
727159:17	###So we 're looking to do it with tape recorders on the busiest entrance and you know and just say car D five one four R G M blah blah blah . ###Get them all down and then the person on the quieter entrance can just write them down . 
727162:20	###You know you can just say D five one four . ###Well that 's what you wanna , so much quicker would n't it , just say the Escort D five one four . 
727193:10	###Mm . ###How the hell he 's wangled it , honest to god !

737422:9	###I got pull over inside then the motorbike 's ###Yeah but you do n't 
737495:29	###Would you see the ###I would I could .

743690:27	###So it it 's not specifically related to the benefit office where they 're signing . ###It 's based on where they live . 
743723:47	###Erm situation where you have somebody who has left their job . ###Was n't clear at the time what the circumstances were .

760408:16	###There 's one at Thatcham ###Thatcham ? 
760418:73	###yeah , I think it 's an organ , and that , that is all in those two recesses , now , you know if I find you know that I do n't get anywhere and I ca n't see that I wo n't , but if , because the bathroom is where the dog is there , of course consequently that comes through the corner of the lounge ###Mm 
760426:18	###I know , and this is what I said , he said I know I do n't really want the old vinyl , do it anyway ###oh it 's a pig of a job 
760449:63	###down ###Oh yes 
760467:13	###Yeah , like where I sit in my chair if I look up there I can see it , but as I say it 's not there all the wallpaper ###it does n't , but when he first sort of put it up , I thought oh crumbs look at that

760672:33	###Where did you hang your clothes ? ###Hook on the back of the door or there was no such thing as wardrobes . 
760695:8	###And it was wicker did you say ? ###No I believe that 's gone now . 
760700:47	###There was Mr and then a bit further up on the right hand side was a fella who used to have the contract for making the bread for the ###This is in Street ? 
760704:154	###Tell me what you remember about the Palfry Working Men 's Club , your sort of earliest memories of it ###So you say it was a few railway men that got together and

761254:23	###Postcards please to Funny Man , , Derby , Leicester , Lincoln or Nottingham , whichever is closest to you . ###Postcards to be here by Wednesday next week when again we 'll have , all being well , our Funny Man competition . 
761531:7	###It 's obvious that the people of Skegness do not want to give . ###Mhm . 
761532:22	###Mhm . ###You have to live with this . 
761623:19	###Well I used to run my business from the teashop in and I ha they put phones and everything in for at the corner table . ###Er but when they changed the room round I moved to the because and I became a director of the for a while fo three f four years something like that . 
761641:52	###She was er I mean was a pop s ex pop singer , I 'd only just stopped singing a few weeks before I started to work with Sybil and she could not have been more gracious and generous in helping me get through it . ###She was wonderful . 
761662:9	###I did n't ever relish the thought of becoming a sort of geriatric performer , going around clubs and summer seasons . ###Er I 'd always wanted to act even as a kid of fifteen sixteen er and I got into singing before I went into acting and so acting s see that seemed to be a good period to break my life and start again .

761670:23	###Yeah well I 've always done that , you know for good or worse . ###Er I 've always er , I do n't think I e I b th whenever I 've been unhappy with work it 's been work that I 've allowed myself to do for ulterior motives , for money or whatever I m The things I 've done er even th the things that have been unsuccessful th if I 've wanted to do them , I 've been able to live with that . 
761679:47	###That corner at the Hotel ? ###Well er ha you know I found myself after Budgie managing a singer called Leo and that led to a lot of interesting business and getting involved an , and I sort of forgot Adam Faith for ten years and just got diverted really . 
761746:9	###two minutes twelve seconds could they ? ###It did n't take a lot of learning . 
761758:12	###And I think if any performers know any where they may find problems is if they 're still very much involved in the music industry , because it becomes a sort of er a diversionary activity . ###It 's a full time commitment er t and you if you are very if if you are er like say it 's so all the time , it 's difficult for her then to cease to be that , to be somebody else . 
761758:57	###And I think if any performers know any where they may find problems is if they 're still very much involved in the music industry , because it becomes a sort of er a diversionary activity . ###It 's a full time commitment er t and you if you are very if if you are er like say it 's so all the time , it 's difficult for her then to cease to be that , to be somebody else . 
761791:9	###Acting or singing . ###So 
761872:42	###Yeah definitely . ###Yeah . 
762215:50	###Eh ? ###Can you believe that ? 
762245:54	###Yeah . ###You 're saying that there is no traffic problem in Newark , 
762545:91	###aye is it not in there ? ###no , only 
762607:130	###I think what what we want to know is er the estimator at . ###yes , right 
762693:130	###George funnily enough the time that we did a course with I P R before ###mhm 
762714:30	###No I find him quite helpful ###aha 
762717:30	###right well that 's a possibility I mean ###So when are you thinking about that in the summer 
762725:106	###I 'll quickly rattle through the next one effectively nothing more has happened at Napier , they went off for their Christmas holidays about the fourth of November and came back about the nineteenth of January er , not quite as bad as that but nearly as I mean they 've even longer holidays than we 've got and we get a fortnight at Christmas and New Year ###I think you meant the fourth of December and not fourth of November 
762725:192	###I 'll quickly rattle through the next one effectively nothing more has happened at Napier , they went off for their Christmas holidays about the fourth of November and came back about the nineteenth of January er , not quite as bad as that but nearly as I mean they 've even longer holidays than we 've got and we get a fortnight at Christmas and New Year ###I think you meant the fourth of December and not fourth of November 
762759:50	###yeah , that 's the core but it needs fleshing out more and a has agreed that you know it 's if you just stuck to the Editor 's Handbook it 's too narrow and it does need , I mean B A I E in London thus far are being extremely helpful if slightly cautious and I 've to go down and talk to the revamped education committee when the revamped education committee gets around to having a meeting ###Well it 's due to have one very soon 
762765:19	###I know , hang on I 'm not sure whether that 's right ###well I have it I have it from the words of himself er 
762769:120	###mm ###and they want to make it an elected module for people doing other things 
762885:9	###I 'll call him tomorrow ###finished transcribing those notes 
762953:57	###yeah ###yes 
762957:44	###But I think the difficulties buying into sections of an H N C course ###Well that would be up to the colleges , if they 're commercially astute they 'll say right yeah twenty-five quid for that , in fact it would be a lot less because it 's only for three months 
762969:15	###I mean this is something that we could maybe be of help to in fact maybe something that I could be of help to them on because I actually do lectures on public relations how to assess what I mean at a very basic level you want to communicate with press how do you do it but before you do it why do you want to do it . ###Have you made up your mind what your message what 've you got to tell the press this is how you go about targeting 
762985:32	###He 's the young lad who was at S T D he 's now working for himself ###that 's right , that 's right and now that he 's shaken off the Scottish Office I invited him to come along to it as well so we may find 
762997:107	###now I was reading about him a few days ago ###that 's right because they 've just released papers after thirty years of work that he was doing for the M O D he was actually doing it in his role as a member of the P R flight , Beaver Brooke sold the government this idea 
763000:130	###sure that 's right but I mean I think the beginners are the people coming in new to the bis ###when you say new to the business do you mean new in terms of employment as opposed to say graduates from Queen Margaret or Napier or anywhere else ? 
763037:97	###about thirty two and female ###um right I think I need you to sign it actually so if you could just sign here 
763037:134	###about thirty two and female ###um right I think I need you to sign it actually so if you could just sign here 
763096:49	###That 's in fact , probably how much you earn every time you collect a no . ###Let 's keep it dead simple . 
763110:66	###So your ratios and the things you should be looking at , or the activity stuff is how many calls I 'm making , how many no 's do I get , and how much is each one of those no 's worth . ###Because what you do , you go great , I 've made a sale , and that earned me two hundred and eighty pound . 
763138:28	###Eighty five percent . ###Do you all understand the benefits of doing that ? 
763234:115	###Yes ? ###Personal obligations , well , this is vitally important , because you are going to need the people you share your life with . 
763322:41	###Alright . ###So what I 'm saying is here is , again your ratios and anything on the computer , it will tell you how many appointments you need to make just from your ratios . 
763323:9	###So what I 'm saying is here is , again your ratios and anything on the computer , it will tell you how many appointments you need to make just from your ratios . ###Let 's say then , I just , I used to have to work on eleven appointments a week because if I had eleven appointments a week , two people would perhaps blow me out , change their minds , two people would rearrange , two people would say no thank you , and another two would say , yes , but I need to do it next month , which might leave me with two sales . 
763343:50	###It 's prominent , yes ? ###This is good , because it gives me control when I make my appointments . 
763343:65	###It 's prominent , yes ? ###This is good , because it gives me control when I make my appointments . 
763354:7	###So that eventually we 'll find a mutually agreeable time . ###Yet I 'm in control . 
763355:53	###Yet I 'm in control . ###You must be in control . 
763355:76	###Yet I 'm in control . ###You must be in control . 
763364:65	###Are you with me here ? ###I 'm working this week to set up , I 'm over here , I 'm setting up next week . 
763365:11	###I 'm working this week to set up , I 'm over here , I 'm setting up next week . ###If I 've got a couple of these blank , I cannot finish on Friday night , I 'm going to have to do some overtime . 
763365:73	###I 'm working this week to set up , I 'm over here , I 'm setting up next week . ###If I 've got a couple of these blank , I cannot finish on Friday night , I 'm going to have to do some overtime . 
763371:96	###So again it 's a discipline . ###You 'll be letting yourself . 
763516:47	###Dreadful ###It would n't be a good night would it ? 
763607:11	###What do we do if there are n't ###It 's just a matter of waiting for your references to be checked out , or whatever the complication is , so all you 'd do , is stay , I mean , do n't sit at home . 
763692:11	###Well there 's not much of it . ###Make the best of it aye 
763697:10	###As soon as you 've got that , you can . ###Is that the results that you 've taken today ? 
763714:29	###Section three , goes in there , and then I 'll give you your induction report back , which Alan 's got at the moment , and that goes in section three , and that 's fantastic eh , so let 's have a nibble something to eat . ###So what have you got to take on Sunday , it 's these two is n't it ? 
763733:31	###It did n't just start off with human beings , they s started in sectors and it spread . ###I do n't think it 's as bad as that here but I do n't think it can ever happen here , hopefully . 
763921:43	###Against . ###and Mr 
764122:23	###Here , here . ###I and some others have tried to do something about it because you 'll remember in the last year last two years , we have put in a a sum of money in the budget to increase the allowances for members and for resources to to support members . 
764144:12	###New management styles are being developed to deal with new roles new circumstances . ###Local governments at the forefront of this changes . 
764149:57	###Unfortunately erm er , the er argument has been sidetracked into a spat about whether you 've got more powers or you have n't got more powers and er and other matters and er er I do n't think if we 're gonna get a sensible response to the D o E that we need to axe er er grind axes in that way . ###There 's no doubt Chairman local government is changing erm the Leicestershire management initiative actually acknowledged the need to change to an enabling authority . 
764164:17	###Chairman wants his tea not yet Mr . ###I do 
764208:12	###That would be totally wrong and totally undemocratic and heaven help us if we ended back in the situation where we had a lady in number ten Downing Street who waved the hand bag at all and sundry without any thought at all for the democratic situation ###Can you be quiet please . 
764217:8	###I endorse everything that was said and everything that said . ###Mr do you wish to reply ? 
764245:36	###Right , I think we 'll call them to order shall we . ###Yes , let 's 
764260:45	###I will not support this amendment . ###I I find this quite extraordinary Chairman after two years of consistently arguing and voting in committee and at council , they appear to have been bought off by the Labour group and now intend to to support a fudged half merger , half federation option . 
764289:127	###adequate youth and community provision in their areas . ###I know I would and I would n't blame anybody else for doing so . 
764309:31	###The reason why this amendment in my view is one that can take us forward is that it places responsibility now for clearing up the mess clearly where it belongs and that 's with the Labour group . ###This is a Labour amendment it is up to them now to implement it implement it within existing budgets is what it says and we shall see whether they take their responsibilities as seriously as they should . 
764309:215	###The reason why this amendment in my view is one that can take us forward is that it places responsibility now for clearing up the mess clearly where it belongs and that 's with the Labour group . ###This is a Labour amendment it is up to them now to implement it implement it within existing budgets is what it says and we shall see whether they take their responsibilities as seriously as they should . 
764328:30	###You pour the money into this , it 's bounced back on you but as usual there is no limit . ###I 've heard members from the other side say money does n't matter this is democracy . 
764348:12	###No we 've got the other amendment but it 's not been moved yet . ###It 's not been moved . 
764382:9	###Can I can I say before I do launch into the amendment to Mr that you have played your card at the last election and the Leicestershire public has resoundedly given their answer to your particular policies . ###So I do n't think anyone here as an elected member , needs to defend their positions if they wish to move from a political or a bureaucratic policy to something which is more pluralist and much more representative of the kind of policies that this council should be discussing not only now but also in the future . 
764393:36	###Much more importantly , not only does it preserve the integrity of the people of Highfields but I guess in many ways it preserves the integrity of both the parties concerned while moving and supporting this particular amendment . ###Can I say finally Chairman , that I will be instigating a er a request er I shall be requesting I should say perhaps to the director of education that erm the three party spokesman on the management committee and all those officers who will be involved in implementing this decision will get together at the earliest and I 'm citing possibly next week so that we can be on our way to plan the next step forward to a concrete implementation of this particular proposal . 
764402:67	###Er , er Mr might have added that er the village hall management committees which er he has a great affection would not be unhappy if they had the sum of five hundred and one thousand one hundred and thirteen pounds with which to provide sources , er resources for the communities that he represents . ###Chairman er in his remarks a bit earlier on Professor said that he did not think it was appropriate to give executive power to the director of education I wrote your words down at the time he did not think it appropriate to give executive power to the director of education and he said , despite Mr ' s clarification you want to move a bit nearer if you 're going to be his minder Mr that in fact he did n't 
764404:87	###that Liberals are incapable of sustaining er the same argument in committee , er sub-committee , main committee and council and I have to say er that erm er placing a bet with Ernie was taking money off children . ###And I 'm I 'm I I 'm I 'm delighted er I shall be encouraging them to pay up promptly . 
764412:12	###Because it 's quite clear from hereafter there is a moral to be learned for this saga . ###All you need to do is to be sufficiently obstructive for a sufficiently long time and and his mates will turn around and throw up their hands and shak and and turn somersaults . 
764421:7	###I think that to support this motion would be extremely unfortunate and would lead to potential disaster , not for the county council but indeed for the Highfields community . ###I 'm not surprised that Mr is happy to propose it because in fact it actually means that the status quo will in fact be cemented that that the situation that we 've been faced with will in fact be enshrined and supported by the council and and the Labour party have been consistently advocating that really a and they will get their way if this motion is passed . 
764429:21	###If any party on the management committee does n't like the split it will five member it back through the whole structure to this county council and we shall have proceeded no further . ###Instead of having a working arrangement it is , will in fact be a total administrative disaster . 
764455:7	###What I would say is this three things . ###One , the director of education has now got , and his staff , have now got to accept that they are no barriers to prevent moving forward on a linked , a form of linked centres . 
764463:10	###But it can work and it will work with our support . ###There 's a lot of good practice to build upon in Highfields . 
764472:7	###He 's cost us , cost us a million pounds in the first year he was a councillor . ###Now with regard to this particular thing , er this particular motion . 
764472:49	###He 's cost us , cost us a million pounds in the first year he was a councillor . ###Now with regard to this particular thing , er this particular motion . 
764482:134	###Now , now they are putting their name to to some positive action . ###Now we we and the Conservatives in in the past have been in favour of a decision and a positive action and we would have seen it through . 
764541:30	###Thank you . ###Mr 
764541:71	###Thank you . ###Mr 
764543:15	###It 's not my day really earlier today I had to admit to being grateful to John Gummer now I 'm gonna have to be . ###I know it 's terrible is n't it I never thought I 'd say that . 
764545:101	###Now I 'm gonna have to say I 'm gonna be grateful to Mr it 's a really bad day . ###When my colleague to my right here , Roger and myself put forward a motion at last council on this issue ably led by our glorious leader to my left I would like to say that we 've set up . 
764614:41	###Yeah . ###the leadership in Shanghai . 
764678:152	###Yeah . ###injury and all this going on . 
764690:59	###Yes . ###Right . 
764691:25	###Right . ###Mm yeah there , there is a need to exceed proper limits , he says , that proper limits have to be exceeded in order to right a wrong er it 's also he says necessary to create terror for a while . 
764794:87	###erm we I mean we , we , we 've looked at the , the peasant tenant relationship erm and my , my opinion is that basically you know it was n't quite as bad as everyone 's made out erm but al okay we 're saying that warlords were , were very imperialistic and they were a huge fact to be considered but in Hunan and within the south erm eastern region say ###Mm . 
764822:21	###Mm . ###Now they , they are two clearly very different visions . 
764822:172	###Mm . ###Now they , they are two clearly very different visions . 
764856:23	###Cos I mean , you could say he was biased but I mean he , he obviously thinks this is actually what 's happening . ###Tt and he obviously thinks that , you know , well you 've got to move with it . 
764888:7	###Yeah . ###but erm I do n't actually think that there was revolution in process going if there was , if you know , a hu a huge increase in 
764890:12	###It must be more than propaganda though ? ###Yeah . 
764989:58	###Absolut er particularly a rural re led revolution . ###But he 's also saying is n't he at the end of this paragraph , or he 's implying that th this is this revolution is not happening because we the communists are making it happen , it is happening and we need to react to it and somehow we 've therefore got a choice , we can either trail behind or we can lead it . 
764993:106	###Yeah . ###to the Communist Party given their approach . 
765077:48	###for the landlord okay I 'd be quite happy to ###certainly the case for for the sort of the landless and the , the very poor peasant and I think this is why the , the medium and the wealthy peasants are less interested to be involved , they have got things to lose .

765080:48	###Yeah . ###Mm . 
765179:25	###Hold on c can we sort of stop this now or we 'll go on for ever ###Y y you 're absolutely right that there is some doubt about this was really whether the countryside was like this . 
765179:128	###Hold on c can we sort of stop this now or we 'll go on for ever ###Y y you 're absolutely right that there is some doubt about this was really whether the countryside was like this . 
765198:73	###Yeah . ###Erm however w w with the changing environment erm such as the bigger demonstrations , also the continuing victory of the nor the northern expedition erm it was more easy to join these associations er indeed the there 's a sort of climate of opinion that , you know , if you do n't join that then you 'll be left behind and threatened yourself . 
765198:159	###Yeah . ###Erm however w w with the changing environment erm such as the bigger demonstrations , also the continuing victory of the nor the northern expedition erm it was more easy to join these associations er indeed the there 's a sort of climate of opinion that , you know , if you do n't join that then you 'll be left behind and threatened yourself . 
765222:167	###Erm the last group , obviously the poor peasants which is the real vanguard of the revolution he says erm he says they have fought militantly through the two periods of underground work and of open activity , they 're the most responsive to the Communist Party leadership . ###They are deadly enemies of the camp of the local tyrants and evil gentry and attack without the slightest hesitation .

765518:135	###It is but I mean if you look at point four , overthrowing the feudal rule of the ###Oh yeah . 
765655:42	###Th there 's no challenge here to landlords per se . ###No but you 're taking their power away and you 're making them defenceless .

766442:32	###Er , are those the only two ways in which it could be achieved ? ###Have we got to choose one or the other . 
766444:90	###I think time will come when we will have to . ###Mm . 
766455:35	###and see the er , decay has set in more and more and more . ###It 's growing in a mental 
766459:15	###I think yeah . ###Back to basics . 
766579:69	###Or you would have , say , taken it to the Post Office , or something . ###Yeah , yeah , yeah . 
766619:18	###So the child , can be born to Miss Jones , have a father called Smith , and the child can be either Smith or Jones . ###That 's right . 
766672:25	###but years ago they would have put up with , and said nothing . ###Yeah . 
766716:21	###Again , I think it 's a change of mores . ###Erm , I have I think cousin , erm , who was in the Air Force during the war , and came back from the Air Force with a child . 
766727:46	###But there was a time when she was a sort of pariah . ###Yes . 
766795:64	###So , anyway , I hope it was n't too distracting for him , and that he was able to pick out , erm , the information that he wanted . ###So . 
766872:59	###Yeah . ###Mm . 
766879:38	###Yeah . ###Oh . 
766880:141	###Oh . ###For someone to come and clean , and then you would have to pay V A T on it . 
766884:110	###And t and th then , since the paper talk , that 's right , it 's nothing to do with it , but it may have a bit to do with justice , we 'll get round to it in a bit . ###T since the the paper article , I wrote direct to the Chancellor , as he 's living down the street , personal letter to him . 
766887:12	###In other words , if any of you were wealthy enough to employ a lady or a gentleman t do the cleaning . ###To do the cleaning 
766890:30	###But I always thought cleanliness was next to Godliness , ###Mm . 
766968:121	###Could have said , if if if the finances of that , depends on selling alcohol , then , I think it 's time Norwich City Council made a stand , and say we 're only going to sell non-alcoholic drinks . ###Mm . 
766985:28	###So I think , we erm , anyway , the Wells Council lost it 's case and was really in the bad books over that . ###But , er , so I 've appeared in these places , purely because I 'm , injustice , you know , stirs me up . 
767146:9	###Mm . ###or evict someone . 
767148:22	###The police have to do that . ###No . 
767148:38	###The police have to do that . ###No . 
767226:16	###I 'm thinking general . ###No , I , if you let me finish what I 'm saying . 
767226:78	###I 'm thinking general . ###No , I , if you let me finish what I 'm saying . 
767258:15	###There is no mitigation for things like that . ###They should be , I think they should be finished . 
767349:118	###Perhaps they 've given an overdose of pain killers , or sleeping tablets to an ailing elderly relative . ###Perhaps at that requ , perhaps at that relatives request . 
767383:14	###You know , where where it 's been a case of vandalism or petty theft . ###Yeah 
767383:63	###You know , where where it 's been a case of vandalism or petty theft . ###Yeah 
767410:43	###more than the people have outside . ###Yes . 
767417:35	###I mean , if somebody ca n't actually go back to the person they 've harmed in a in a one to one situation , there 's no reason why they should n't be doing some other form of community service . ###That 's right , I agree . 
767434:15	###But it 's ###again one of those things which appear to be under financial pressure , I mean , one of our most respected adult school members at national level was actually awarded the M B E for his work in Wandsworth Prison , where he ran an adult school for thirty years . 
767443:27	###Oh aye . ###It was cos the prison , the warders , resented somebody going in and and doing this for them . 
767456:10	###before they transferred him to another prison . ###I mean , wh what was the common sense of that sort of bureaucracy stamping on people . 
767585:38	###Presumably he was driving . ###Mm . 
767585:58	###Presumably he was driving . ###Mm . 
767656:10	###She said , oh yes . ###This is where I live and you 're running all over it like this and spoiling it . 
767704:7	###the clue , I I 'm sure if I made a mistakes like that , it 's because it 's , you know , maybe angry and I made the wrong approach . ###Mm . 
767707:74	###Well , very well known , I ca n't remember his name now , but he he had two methods of getting rid of them , erm . ###One they were going into a pub , and going into the toilets , you know , making a , so he had a a policeman waiting in and the toilets , for them you see , and the o one other , notable occasion he was seen chasing them down the main street in Morley , he got his cape on , you see , 
767755:7	###Thirty percent ? ###We wanna get more , you know , there 's th , thi thi this er , there is no point really in saying things like , what I 'd like to do is to improve the quality of the appointments because that do n't tell you anything . 
767794:10	###Woo hoo ! ###That 's a good one is n't it ? 
767810:14	###Yeah . ###Yeah . 
767850:7	###I 'm not saying , obviously if somebody existing based on that . ###That is , that is right . 
767856:24	###Effort . ###Yeah . 
768016:4	###Yes , I think so , I think , that is of course , I I think that erm that the close which you use ###Yeah . 
768177:5	###what the people ###Ha ! 
768205:9	###That 's right . ###he wanted to be the decision maker , and he wanted to make the decision on every single thing himself and then he was turning round and saying to his secretary , well ca n't you do anything ? 
768352:24	###Because you 're spending all day together , and we 'll keep breaking you off into , in twos , into your groups so that you can learn any more about one another . ###And also , of course , you 've got the sort of social thing between you . 
768369:99	###Erm , and then I wanna give you one last exercise before we go . ###Not this sort of er , this sort of thing . 
768374:46	###Lunchtimes as well ? ###Right . 
768374:73	###Lunchtimes as well ? ###Right . 
768375:18	###Right . ###It can be , yeah we had a stop for lunch , we had to have cups of tea , we had to go to ou , out the back and have a fag cos we ca n't smoke in the office . 
768386:42	###They , they might now ###Well you know 
768387:38	###Well you know ###actually it 's a bit boring down there now but they , they had to put my , my explanation of the price of petrol er down , there 's nowhere to thing , cos th the last time I was down there I asked for a pint of bitter and this guy bought it me and said and I wanted two pound thirty or something . 
768422:9	###Right , so I want , having all these virtues and whatever ###What d' ya call the whingies then ? 
768452:66	###Yes . ###And so probably what we need to think about is how you can improve your contributions to the whole thing . 
768514:63	###Mhm . ###is that tomorrow , when we start getting into planning , prioritizing , looking at where the new diaries and all that sort of stuff . 
768544:82	###Fairly true ###Yeah . 
768617:48	###they . ###Mm . 
768809:173	###That 's right . ###Erm and so what we need to think about tomorrow , we 're organizing this plan , or whatever , is how , how do we implement that . 
769114:23	###Well ###Can you see those at the back ? 
769327:7	###David . ###do a tot up ? 
769494:12	###Ah yeah . ###you cannot talk about moving parcels around the country if you do n't know where the towns are . 
769554:188	###the biggest place near it . ###Now what 
769555:93	###Now what ###I 'm saying is , is you ought to get very close to that geographical map because it 's the logistic logistics er difficulty with getting , and you ought to know where there are mountains and where there are valleys and the fact that that , in South Wales they ca n't just go across country , they have to go back down the valley after the M four and up again . 
769869:12	###Give me a paper please ? ###Mm . 
770102:9	###we 've , you 'll see , I mean there 's a , not a very good illustration of a , the hub with the yellow walls of the , the conveyer belt behind you , but you can see the fairly plain packaging that parcels come in . ###The more , er er sophisticated erm wholesale er distributors now know that people just pick up from stock a box do n't they ? 
770151:59	###On the back of every erm contract out there . ###On the back of every contract . 
770247:30	###Well ###We always wo 
770479:19	###Which means ###Well done . 
770646:12	###You get a taxi sometimes do n't you ? ###To places . 
770923:28	###And this is when you 've been on the receiving end of it . ###Now , some of us have n't . 
770964:53	###If , there are , there are industry working to deadlines all the time . ###I in Terry was just mentioning his wife 's business , in advertising , d' ya , would sell the advertising space in your feature or your magazine or whatever try and get the bleeders to send you that what they wanna put in it ! 
771117:67	###Yeah . ###that delivers to Peter . 
771140:38	###got his product quicker . ###That is it . 
771145:18	###Right . ###Improved cash flow . 
771204:13	###And that 's why we do n't make money on carriage forwards cos we do n't sell carriage forwards for the positive reasons , we say , well if they do n't want them send them back , or if they 're damaged send them back . ###Yeah . 
771220:57	###Mm . ###as well is n't there with businesses ? 
771314:7	###And , what did you say that we get a lot of claims on carriage forward ? ###Damaged foodstuff . 
771316:18	###You have to insure them do n't you , carriage forward of course ? ###Yeah . 
771397:11	###Likely event so ###Well we wo n't us , it wo n't graduate any 
771428:92	###we are our own ###I know about this . 
771591:11	###thousand . ###Aha . 
771625:27	###If he needs five thousand pound coverage on each item ###On each one . 
771641:9	###As most insuring company , mos most brokers or people like that . ###how value it is , and most insurance , yeah , that 's right through a brokers . 
771642:9	###how value it is , and most insurance , yeah , that 's right through a brokers . ###Would you have to send in a profile ? 
771644:36	###Do you have to send it in ? ###Yeah . 
771789:14	###You said would you drive my Rover that 's the question ? ###When you said we 'll talk about that question last . 
771807:34	###but what I 'm saying is , awareness now , I 'm just slagging off the awareness . ###When it sounds rehearsed , it sounds , like , that . 
771843:9	###The blurb . ###got that one . 
771928:81	###Now , to be fair that comes with experience . ###Of course . 
772059:34	###of what they get out of it . ###. And we keep it simple . 
772064:10	###Er , there may be something you 're interested in there ? ###Now there are tighter ways of actual sales negotiations but we have n't got the time to go into it today . 
772403:9	###vets and all sorts ###Mm . 
772431:7	###Cold . ###It 's , still a 
772503:38	###Long words like . ###What I 'm saying is , is if customers 
772511:58	###Yeah . ###fra , ma frame of mind , you got to demand and wait for the answer , even though it might take a minute for the to say erm , erm , oh we use erm , you know , we 've got a , a , a local van that comes and se , like , you know . 
772583:12	###now you 've gotta use those features and benefits to explain . ###So you 've gotta be thinking and know which features to pull out . 
772583:118	###now you 've gotta use those features and benefits to explain . ###So you 've gotta be thinking and know which features to pull out . 
772598:17	###And in closing you simply say do you want to use us ? ###Shall we go ahead with it ? 
772603:31	###Get some help . ###Shall we start , shall we start coming up ? 
772620:12	###good . ###Mm . 
772697:24	###to do them now . ###Yeah but I thought we should get cracking in the car . 
772768:14	###and you finish the . ###Okay then . 
772890:12	###The answer too is other than to try and work towards the two communities will agree on something and that 's how your how you 'll like it . ###agree . 
772896:252	###Just say it was some revolutionary group ###I mean that people like , you know , have said that the British secret intelligence have been have been doing now for a quite long time have been waging a sort of undercover war and er I 'm sure some of it 's true 
772997:7	###One year student interviews , I think does n't apply . ###Er notes to all students , it says it is not acceptable to take food and drinks into the corridors . 
773021:136	###Oh no . ###Right I 'll be for the rest of the tutorial really , erm find yourselves something to do , I just really want to follow up er the little amount of time that I spent with second years er looking at their action plans . 
773029:11	###That 's all . ###which is trying to accumulate a record of how the English language is used in everyday context , like lectures , like in broadcasts , like in people 's homes and so forth . 
773142:177	###It means that the world is a slightly is a slightly safer place because if you do n't do this , if you do n't flirt , then it wo n't happen . ###Well , that 's not necessarily er an accurate way of understanding sex abuse but nevertheless it can it can perhaps help people restore their equilibrium a bit . 
773167:121	###Getting taken to the doctors and getting needles stuck in you erm things like um being fed cod liver oil , things like being hit for doing things which I thought were quite legitimate like pruning my mother 's geraniums and stuff like that . ###Um y' know all these things were not very pleasant and yet you 're used as a child , you 're used as a child to have grown-ups um be able to inflict things on you . 
773167:153	###Getting taken to the doctors and getting needles stuck in you erm things like um being fed cod liver oil , things like being hit for doing things which I thought were quite legitimate like pruning my mother 's geraniums and stuff like that . ###Um y' know all these things were not very pleasant and yet you 're used as a child , you 're used as a child to have grown-ups um be able to inflict things on you . 
773195:140	###So er just because it looks like seduction does n't mean it 's not abuse , I suppose that 's what I 'm saying in the in the in a nutshell . ###Erm now erm a number of people erm , getting on t back on to the handout for a moment , er a number of people who 've reported being b abused as children also report that they do try and tell people , either at the time or shortly afterwards , and this business of not being believed is quite a common report from survivors , not being believed at first . 
773201:136	###One is as people get older , like when they get up to about fourteen or fifteen , they start um feeling perhaps a bit more self-confident , a bit more able to do something about it . ###Also , by that time you 're erm often well into adolescence so I suppose the as it were the dangers of pregnancy become much more much more to the fore . 
773226:48	###Erm there 's um ah the origins of the myth that you can catch V D off toilet seats I suppose you could call it . ###Um around the middle years of the twentieth century there was ah a good deal of well people were spotting signs which would nowadays be taken as evidence of child sex abuse but they were giving other explanations for them . 
773226:62	###Erm there 's um ah the origins of the myth that you can catch V D off toilet seats I suppose you could call it . ###Um around the middle years of the twentieth century there was ah a good deal of well people were spotting signs which would nowadays be taken as evidence of child sex abuse but they were giving other explanations for them .

773233:145	###These are catalogued in um well I 've referenced it to Bartman 1990 but you 'll see more about this erm in , let me see , there 's Dennis Howitt 's book concerning psychology which has a chapter about erm child sex abuse in it and there 's also a book that the library 's got called Child Abuse Errors by Dennis Howitt as well erm which has go deals with some of these these issues and arguments too . ###Um and erm that might be that 's one of th some of the few things that the library 's got but erm er anyway . 
773314:116	###Erm so er is there anything else we need to worry about at this stage do you think ? ###Erm I ca n't really do very much until I 've got 
773362:7	###Oh right ###it 's like oh alright 
773362:14	###Oh right ###it 's like oh alright 
773362:28	###Oh right ###it 's like oh alright 
773460:34	###Eleven o' clock Monday is that right , yeah ? ###So what I 'll do is I 'll have the video tape in er with on Monday . 
773460:61	###Eleven o' clock Monday is that right , yeah ? ###So what I 'll do is I 'll have the video tape in er with on Monday . 
773480:174	###There , in this country , more so than any other country in Europe , there 's a tradition of adults abusing children quite legitimately as well in the form of beating them and erm indeed headmasters of Eton back in the eighteenth and nineteenth century were often selected , not because of their scholarly ability , but because of their size and strength . ###Erm there 's the legendary Doctor Keat of Eton who er was was erm legendary precisely because he beat the boys so often and so vigorously . 
773500:124	###Now , erm on the subject of of the family , it 's worth mentioning another erm sort of debate that goes on within the subject of child sex abuse , the business of I suppose you might call it the business of responsibility . ###Now if you fi go back to sort of in the 1970 's and the nineteen possibly into the 1980 's erm there was er a certain amount of emphasis on disrupted family dynamics , there 's something wrong with the families where this kind of thing occurs . 
773500:143	###Now , erm on the subject of of the family , it 's worth mentioning another erm sort of debate that goes on within the subject of child sex abuse , the business of I suppose you might call it the business of responsibility . ###Now if you fi go back to sort of in the 1970 's and the nineteen possibly into the 1980 's erm there was er a certain amount of emphasis on disrupted family dynamics , there 's something wrong with the families where this kind of thing occurs . 
773531:78	###That is , according to false memory syndrome theorists , somehow the process of therapy , the process of disclosure , the process of interviewing people to find out the details of the abuse , somehow that constructs the abuse itself , somehow that 's erm the thing that 's that 's causing the memories . ###Um somehow it 's not really to do with whether they were abused or not as children , somehow it 's the it 's the therapist . 
773546:22	###Erm , client , I 'm really scared , I do n't have any control over the bulimia . ###You know I throw up food without even wanting to . 
773582:187	###They thought well kids just make a fuss anyway and they have n't got any proper routes so what 're they making all that fuss about y' know , shut up , um and er that kind of things was going on . ###So er sometimes it 's it 's very erm difficult to re-live these particular experiences . 
773599:138	###That is um if you erm if you make children er sort of lie down on their fronts with their bums in their air and you and bums in their air and you touch anuses apparently the anus dilates , or it can do , erm allegedly in children who 've been sexually abused in that way , in children who 've been who 've been penetrated anally . ###Now this procedure was used to , in inverted commas , diagnose a number of children in the Cleveland area as having been sexually abused . 
773641:130	###stand it you know ###yeah well um I do n't know , maybe she grew up when there were y' know smoking was surrounded by rather different attitudes . 
773684:13	###If I do correlations I mean is that gonna be absolute massive job ? ###Erm it 's a pretty it 's a pretty big S P S S job actually erm if you 've got that many . 
773684:59	###If I do correlations I mean is that gonna be absolute massive job ? ###Erm it 's a pretty it 's a pretty big S P S S job actually erm if you 've got that many . 
773688:67	###Erm it sometimes gets a bit , runs out of memory , if if you put very many more than that in . ###But the one on the in the public access machines over th in the main building they 'll be able to do more because it 's a more powerful computer it 's based in . 
773778:30	###They need it to finance new projects and which they ultimately hope those projects will bring in a profit on the capital employed . ###But once employed as capital that money stays there , it 's stuck and hopefully it earns money but it 's stuck there forever until the sale of that asset is is a achieved . 
773780:39	###Many companies when needing to finance new projects have to raise more capital . ###This is often done by obtaining money in the form of loans , venture capital guarantees and that sort of effort . 
773788:7	###We have an acknowledged need to invest more capital to provide more housing for the most needy in our population . ###The way it is at present , we cannot , we cannot get more loot to put into the new project but the bank manager , i.e. the Chancellor of the Exchequer , reminded us a few months ago that the other way of funding our projects he encouraged us to look at our current assets and if possible liquidate some of that asset and fund it , or or use it to fund our new schemes and this Mr Mayor is what we should be doing . 
773816:148	###You could 've let us use some of that eight , over eight million pounds that we have stuffed away , set aside to actually promote our social housing programme . ###So basically , I do n't think that it is a simple picture of being able to get a capital receipt and go out and use it . 
773818:16	###There will be occasions where indeed if people ar people in marginal circumstances are encouraged to buy then we will find , as the local authorities , that they will not be able to raise a mortgage in in in the private sector and we will actually have to supply the mortgage ourselves so where 's the capital receipt gone ? ###It 's disappeared really has n't it ? 
773854:7	###Firstly I have never seen a more clearer er grant from the government to actually let you build houses this year , this is whole point of th th this should happen and if we do n't take it up I believe that in future years to come we shall regret it very , very strongly indeed . ###As far as promotion is concerned , yes I will not deny every tenant probably knows about the right to buy but then everybody knows there are mars bars and mars bars spend millions of pounds promoting their product . 
773854:28	###Firstly I have never seen a more clearer er grant from the government to actually let you build houses this year , this is whole point of th th this should happen and if we do n't take it up I believe that in future years to come we shall regret it very , very strongly indeed . ###As far as promotion is concerned , yes I will not deny every tenant probably knows about the right to buy but then everybody knows there are mars bars and mars bars spend millions of pounds promoting their product . 
773856:14	###You have to y y y you have to promote the product to make people buy it . ###I 'm following on from that . 
773861:114	###Could I just point out that councillor that contrary to call my bluff , deviation and repetition are no grounds for allowing allowing . ###All those in favour of the proposals please show and all those against . 
773880:141	###immediately leaps to mind . ###The fact that their citizens leak into the city to avail themselves of our facilities is something that we might deal with in another sphere , even on day residents were seen to attend the theatre in this town recently , erm unfortunately this authority does n't see fit to actually subsidise the theatre . 
773896:139	###That will bring the eventual budget down a fine tune particularly with regard to er recommendations of the housing committee with regard er to the erm which clearly there will be some people . ###What we have done is to suggest that we actually need a lower budget than we had originally assessed . 
773906:100	###This seems to me to be a highly , high responsible budget bringing us closer and closer to a position where we will eventually reach . ###We are spending now , if this budget is accepted , a mere eleven percent of the standard spending assessment levels which means that in time we are going to get down to where the government is going to demand that we . 
773924:18	###But there 's another cost to the savings that have been exemplified and that we are going to be forced to take with regard to this budget and that is something that anybody who uses the city council services , and particularly I would suggest councillors , are going to notice and that is the stress that we are putting on the people that we employ . ###It is all very well to say to any people organisation you shall become more and more efficient . 
773924:38	###But there 's another cost to the savings that have been exemplified and that we are going to be forced to take with regard to this budget and that is something that anybody who uses the city council services , and particularly I would suggest councillors , are going to notice and that is the stress that we are putting on the people that we employ . ###It is all very well to say to any people organisation you shall become more and more efficient . 
773942:11	###Pollution , the environment , again that is something which is not just for concern , we know it 's of global concern as well . ###We have some responsibilities in that direction . 
773998:17	###I do n't want to hear any more nonsense about doing the county council 's job because the city already does lots of things for the county council concessionary fares for the elderly for example . ###On the city board last week we had yet another example rather a good project Trumpington disability project , very likely but it 's social services budget . 
774032:31	###Yes I would like also to speak against this amendment erm but for completely different reasons . ###I do n't intend to give the council a to solving the world 's problems and that 's not the word to mind but problems . 
774042:96	###I made it clear that our policy was to use that money to reduce the level of the council tax over that period of time . ###I could n't get any clear commitment er from er you Mr Mayor , or the leader of the council as to what would do with that three point two million pounds . 
774044:68	###I also pressed at the city board for something to be done about this problem of the er people disappearing off the poll tax register at an alarming rate I must add . ###And I was absolutely amazed and I think all of us on the opposition benches were absolutely amazed at the city board that you appeared to have no proposals whatsoever to do anything about that situation . 
774047:63	###But spending that hundred thousand pounds as we were told at the time , would only part solve the problem . ###Exactly seven hundred and thirty five thousand pounds . 
774047:97	###But spending that hundred thousand pounds as we were told at the time , would only part solve the problem . ###Exactly seven hundred and thirty five thousand pounds . 
774049:181	###So you 're doing exactly what we were telling you to do a few weeks ago , that you had to er take money out of reserves or you had to cut down on the level of services if you were to avoid putting that thirty four pounds on the council tax bills this year . ###And you very cleverly , very cleverly and I , this is where I congratulate you , built this in to your proposals tonight . 
774060:195	###Well perhaps you or somebody on the other side might care to tell us how you 're gonna take it from three to three and half , cos I 'll quite happily tell you then how we 'll take it from three and half to four percent , so we welcome that as a step in the right direction . ###Obviously as I say , we would support the additional bid of a hundred thousand for pursuing the poll tax er non-registers . 
774084:72	###And I suspect that the next election that will still prevail . ###But clearly the liberal democrats have not learnt the lesson of spending what you have and running prudent budgets . 
774089:53	###Er , but councillor other remark about the labour party moving towards the conservatives is of course a very fair one , but then surely nothing surprises us at the moment about the labour party . ###At long last they 've come out in favour of wealth , is n't that extraordinary , reported in today 's paper . 
774090:14	###At long last they 've come out in favour of wealth , is n't that extraordinary , reported in today 's paper . ###They 're also , Mr Mayor , interestingly coming out in favour of the individual but I must admit I applaud that and at long last in some , admittedly very modest way , er they are moving , I wo n't say to fiscal responsibility , but at least they 're learning the lessons of the recklessness of the past of their policies . 
774094:10	###If we are above government guidelines it is the labour party 's fault and if indeed we are penalised in the future it is the labour party 's fault , none other and to the extent that you run the risk now by having this excess eleven percent budget over the er standing expenditure assessment er will once again unfortunately find you guilty in that regard . ###What I did find very distressing in his remarks , er were basically in respect of some of the savings . 
774106:40	###One of the most emotional times for anyone . ###For you to downgrade that and say well I 'm sorry now we 're doing all this , we ca n't guarantee that , it 's disgraceful , absolutely disgraceful . 
774106:66	###One of the most emotional times for anyone . ###For you to downgrade that and say well I 'm sorry now we 're doing all this , we ca n't guarantee that , it 's disgraceful , absolutely disgraceful . 
774142:69	###Our view is that the people of this city value the services the council provides and do n't want them withdrawn . ###Ours has been a process of careful pruning year on year . 
774169:10	###That 's politics . ###What we 've actually got here is a judicious budget proposal which yes , has changed over the last fortnight , I make no apologies for that . 
774190:13	###Okay councillor can you proceed ? ###Does everyone have a copy of this one good er Mr Mayor erm all budgets are a balance between er spending on database services and spending on capital projects and on keeping taxes down . 
774204:59	###And also of course there is the question of Parkside Pool although observant members of the council will notice that Parkside Pool is n't mentioned in our amendment . ###That is because , fortunately I suppose , our Parkside modernisation scheme we are reliable informed by officers , would have no revenue effects in ninety three , ninety four . 
774209:34	###Education fund is in there we 've not raised the price but that is our top priority and we believe it 's societies top priority also in our amendment is our idea for extending concessionary bus fares for journeys within the city to those of school age who do not quality for the statutory schemes run by the county . ###The idea there is to try to get some reduction , some reduction in the level of traffic at peak hours and to help public transport . 
774214:15	###The example of this of course is the night time call out service , which all parties support , which comes every year as a problem of funding , do we want a full week service ? ###And we do , the question is can we afford it and we think we can . 
774286:234	###Yes . ###Well some of these national conflicts have been artificially created by the Soviet State , but of course some of them have n't like the Azerbaijan Armenian Border conflict , that 's been going on for centuries , it was existed before the Soviet and it 's gonna go on existing after it . 
774298:26	###You 've got to get Boris 's agreement before anyone can press the trigger or is this actually much more dangerous than it sounds , is he saying we want to take over the nuclear weapons . ###Well again it could be sinister if things get out of hand , but er , er , and I think the speaker 's warning in that respect is fully justified . 
774299:132	###Well again it could be sinister if things get out of hand , but er , er , and I think the speaker 's warning in that respect is fully justified . ###Er the former Soviet Republics are going to have to decide what kind of defensive alliance they want among themselves . 
774301:40	###Ukraine for example is already stated in its er declaration of Sovereignty that it regards itself as a non nuclear zone , so they 're not going to want nuclear weapons for themselves , and er , I imagine that the former republics will have to quite a a comprehensive military alliance perhaps on the lines of NATO and that nuclear weapons will be vested in that alliance . ###Russia will be the leader of that alliance and therefore like America NATO will probably have the decisive say on what 's done with those nuclear weapons . 
774301:58	###Ukraine for example is already stated in its er declaration of Sovereignty that it regards itself as a non nuclear zone , so they 're not going to want nuclear weapons for themselves , and er , I imagine that the former republics will have to quite a a comprehensive military alliance perhaps on the lines of NATO and that nuclear weapons will be vested in that alliance . ###Russia will be the leader of that alliance and therefore like America NATO will probably have the decisive say on what 's done with those nuclear weapons .

774348:7	###Can we just the two things you 've said . ###Firstly that , he 's a hardliner erm just like the others , I mean are you talking about and and and the people who lead the , the coup and that you 're saying Yeltsin 's no different from them ? 
774349:26	###Firstly that , he 's a hardliner erm just like the others , I mean are you talking about and and and the people who lead the , the coup and that you 're saying Yeltsin 's no different from them ? ###I must say Professor Hoskin I was rather struck by pictures in the papers today , yesterday of Boris Yeltsin standing over a boar he 'd shot , it was strongly reminiscent of pictures we 've seen of the former president of Romania , Ceausescu . 
774370:9	###Will democracy really work ? ###Well of course there is n't very much of a democratic tradition in Russia that 's quite true , but that 's very different from of the Russians and all the Soviet people and saying they 're simply incapable of living under democracy . 
774370:210	###Will democracy really work ? ###Well of course there is n't very much of a democratic tradition in Russia that 's quite true , but that 's very different from of the Russians and all the Soviet people and saying they 're simply incapable of living under democracy . 
774376:55	###Now the present British government is very anxious to give the Russians our financial expertise rather than practical help to promote a market economy . ###You think our financial expertise does n't amount to practical help ? 
774414:32	###So Commander Blake we should not just offer a stick saying that we we are n't going to help you until we start dismantling your military programme , we should offer carrots too , do you agree ? ###Well I , I I , I do n't mind how it 's done but erm I hear nothing on the many people on , you know , who talk about erm giving aid erm a dread from this problem is this vast erm amount of the G M P and going on armaments and going on one way and another . 
774424:36	###Yes . ###Erm , interesting , president Saddam Hussein has er also deplored er the ending of the coup and the fact that er Gorbachev has backed . 
774445:133	###It was conducted in a in a devastating effect because was totally unchecked and America got the upper hand and they simply played the game by their own favour without giving due consideration to humanitarian or , or even the justice er element and this , this is how the world 's gonna be , and America is an arrogant super power . ###What 's . 
774449:7	###Well the thing that concerns me is the readiness in which er rushing to ban the communist party . ###I would rely on Mr Yeltsin and Mr Gorbachev that the only possible way in which they could have reached the eminence they have today is through membership of the party . 
774466:34	###However what , what I think is the most important aspect of this , the communist party is not and never has been a party in the normal sense of the term , it 's a closed shop for the ruling establishment of the Soviet Union and therefore it 's quite simply incompatible with politics . ###Eighteen months ago it gave up its monopoly of politics but it continued to exist and it continued really as a kind of dog in the manger to prevent the er establishment of normal multi-party politics . 
774500:12	###Yes , Professor Hoskin . ###Yes , yes we have got some unused resources that could be er , er , diverted towards the Soviet economy , food surpluses for example , the coming winter is going to be very difficult in the Soviet Union and I think direct food aid may well be necessary . 
774540:50	###And that 's a beamer , and DaSilva is , stifled in the extreme , it 's a no ball , now whether that was because it was a beamer I think , but we do n't know whether it 's overstretched or not as far as footwork was concerned , it brought a run down to square leg anyway , and er DaSilva is now eighteen , total a hundred and twelve for three . . ###No , no I think it 's just that er , then your sorts of signs I think to indicate that , that was a no ball because it was , I 'm sure an unintentional er beamer and er , they still did well really to get a bit of back on here so . 
774545:18	###And David quite got his bearings right , full toss that one , I 've , I 've been watching this summer this slope at Lord 's can play havoc with bowlers and I always get the impression that er , he 's , he bowls better than the nursery end at Lord 's , David Lawrence . ###Hm , hm . 
774547:164	###But , Tufnell of course must have precedence there at the moment . ###Oh absolutely , yes . 
774568:63	###Dicky agreed a signal , I ca n't , you have n't heard before , he lost two of his little erm . ###Oh dear . 
774578:76	###It was a a well pitched up ball , I like , I like love Tufnell when he gives it a bit of a , on the off stump . ###He 's got his five fielders there , four on the leg side at the moment , so saved , er long leg as well , bowls this one and that again he thrust forward that front pad and DaSilva , and Stewart comes in from mid wicket to field it . 
774614:66	###Yeah , well he 's certainly prepared to do er , make a few unorthodox field placements and that was a very strange field that Lawrence had . ###Yes . 
774615:205	###Yes . ###And when someone goes out , erm , playing a little hesitantly , you ca n't , you know , you have to give the , the England team credit for , for posing some unusual problems . 
774618:78	###You do take a long time to come out has not reached the non strikers and er , some said he had a little reading from who . ###I suppose they 're waiting with their pads on are they ? 
774618:136	###You do take a long time to come out has not reached the non strikers and er , some said he had a little reading from who . ###I suppose they 're waiting with their pads on are they ? 
774618:190	###You do take a long time to come out has not reached the non strikers and er , some said he had a little reading from who . ###I suppose they 're waiting with their pads on are they ? 
774626:27	###got clapped for the beamer did he ? ###No , probably not . 
774628:33	###, and I , I , think we must assume , that , that , he was no ball because he was a beamer and not because of front foot . ###I , I think so , because oh it 's still difficult to interpret Dickie 's stipulations sometimes , but he was waving his hands towards the scorer . 
774634:129	###I do n't know . ###I think , he did n't look natural did he . 
774634:190	###I do n't know . ###I think , he did n't look natural did he . 
774709:55	###Gooch , and together at second , spinning it , it 's sort of back spin version frisbee , er puts it on his head , he 'll be happy with the way the morning 's gone hmm . ###They 've removed the danger man as far as England were concerned and DaSilva both back in the pavilion and they were the wickets that England needed . 
774738:73	###A hundred and forty-three for four . ###Interest to see how he plays David Lawrence when he gets his he 'll be , he can just slash him away on the off side . 
774752:79	###Gooch has moved himself now to a very advanced second slip , no he 's going back to the aisle or to , I thought perhaps his position as Lawrence comes into short down the leg side and Russell takes it on his knees , but the conscience I think of the ball not carrying , he just mostly can , Chris Lewis that , come up a yard or two and Lewis scraps a mark with his boot . ###who 's probably the orthodox first at position a yard or two behind Jack Russell and Gooch is probably a yard in front of Jack Russell at second slip and Lewis a foot or two up on him at third . 
774767:22	###Tell me , if you 've had ninety miles an hour , straight at your heart . ###Lawrence takes a deep breath and starts off again , with this massive approach , comes in now to , it 's short and it ends in a way I think probably off the body , he tried to take the bottom hand away again , that , that they do seemed to be trying this angle of attack at him , as Botham there at leg gully and a short leg and they 're trying to be , do n't forget the balls at ' s ribcage , he 's certainly troubled by that one . 
774819:166	###Jesus had had many interviews with people , we 've looked at some of them over these past few weeks . ###The time when he met with Nicodemus the religious leader , the time he went out of his way to meet with a woman of Somaria in her dire need . 
774829:17	###What about my suffering ? ###But we see here how Jesus , apart from anything else , deals with his own suffering , he deals with it by ministering to the needs of other people . 
774865:204	###We put all sorts of rules in , we we make them undergo various periods of er , o of probation before we 're wor , we 've we 're , we 're willing to call them Christians . ###Remember the Philippine jailer , he cried out there to the apostle Paul who was , er in jail there with Silas they , they 'd been that tremendous earthquake , and they were released , all their fetters was was were broken , and the prisoners were all , could all have escaped ! 
774876:56	###Way back in Isaiah in thirty fifth chapter , the er , the prophet there gives a little picture , and he uses the illustration , he says this way is so plain , it 's so simple , he said that even the wayfaring man , the traveller , though he is a fool , he does n't need to make any mistakes in it , he does n't need to err in the way , it is so simple , it is so easily understood . ###See exactly how the Lord saved this man . 
774893:78	###Calling out and being rescued . ###Now , the important thing that we see there in being rescued , is that you are totally dependent on the rescuer . 
774893:115	###Calling out and being rescued . ###Now , the important thing that we see there in being rescued , is that you are totally dependent on the rescuer . 
774898:53	###And so if you swam up to somebody who was in difficulty , and you approach them from the front their automatic reaction is to throw their arms around you , do n't let them do it ! ###Because they 'll drown themself and bring you down with them . 
774899:11	###Because they 'll drown themself and bring you down with them . ###And some , as it meant , if that , if they had done that you actually have to put your foot in their sto , chest , or their stomach and push them away from you , and swim around and come at them from the back . 
774902:7	###Once they started doing anything there was trouble . ###And this is it , this plan of salvation that is so simple . 
774948:45	###Just as we saw a few weeks ago Zaccheus was , er , between him being up the tree and hitting the ground , that man was converted . ###He came to know Jesus Christ . 
774966:108	###Jesus says if you love me you will keep my commandments . ###And so there is that command . 
775096:9	###Fearful storms sometimes come along our way and we we wonder what is happening to us and we feel that we 're being thrown around and tossed about from side to side , there seems no way out ! ###There 's seems to be no possible escape . 
775254:35	###Is that what it really means ? ###Is that what the bible means by being blessed by God ? 
775281:26	###And I suppose for every person here , there would be a I would say a similar , but a different er definition . ###There 'd be a lot of similarity to it , and I think if we 're honest a lot of it would come back to things . 
775326:20	###Here then is this man who has this very unusual interview with Jesus Pilate the hard hearted and hard headed governor of Judea , the representative of Caesar the might of imperial Rome and he has upon his hands for trial a man whom he is convinced is innocent . ###A man has been falsely accused , a man who is standing in a court against trumped up charges . 
775332:7	###Now he 's tried to shift the responsibility , and that 's something we 're all good at doing , we like shifting the responsibility , whether it 's in even the very tiny things in life , or whether it 's major issues , we like to shift the responsibility to other people , then if it goes wrong we 're alright , our hands are clean , we we 'll have nothing to do with it . ###And so , Pilate he tries to do this , he tries first of all to shift the responsibility , and he does it by different methods , first of all he sends into Herod , the king then he suggests that Barabbas should be released to the people , now however , both of these methods of shifting responsibility have failed and the ball is firmly back with Pilate . 
775348:156	###But you see the important thing about this scene is not what is taking place there it 's not really that Pilate is standing in , in the trial as the judge of Jesus , it 's not that Pilate has i , within his hands the power of life and death for Jesus , that 's not the important issue , that 's not the real significance of this incident , the real significance is that every one of us at some time or other stand in the same place that Pilate stood . ###That 's the real significance for you and for me . 
775348:192	###But you see the important thing about this scene is not what is taking place there it 's not really that Pilate is standing in , in the trial as the judge of Jesus , it 's not that Pilate has i , within his hands the power of life and death for Jesus , that 's not the important issue , that 's not the real significance of this incident , the real significance is that every one of us at some time or other stand in the same place that Pilate stood . ###That 's the real significance for you and for me . 
775349:21	###That 's the real significance for you and for me . ###It 's not just an event in history two thousand years ago , something that happened way back i in a back water of the Roman empire , that 's not the really important issue for you and for me today it 's , the important thing is that you and I have to stand in that same place that Pilate stood and we have to make that same decision , what will I do then with Jesus that is called the Christ ? 
775349:57	###That 's the real significance for you and for me . ###It 's not just an event in history two thousand years ago , something that happened way back i in a back water of the Roman empire , that 's not the really important issue for you and for me today it 's , the important thing is that you and I have to stand in that same place that Pilate stood and we have to make that same decision , what will I do then with Jesus that is called the Christ ? 
775351:57	###That is the decision you have to face up to , that 's the decision I have to face up to . ###We can put it off for a while , we can say I 'll leave it till I 'm older , I 'll leave it till some other time , I do n't want to make that decision now . 
775359:33	###Have done with him ! ###Or will you respond positively , yes I will receive you , I will you accept you . 
775364:28	###It is of course , true that , although Pilate pronounced the verdict Jesus was already , as the bible says , a lamb slain from before the foundation of the world . ###In God 's purposes Jesus had already gone to the cross , he was alre , hi his , his natural fate if you like , was already sealed , he had come for this purpose , he had come to die . 
775458:7	###He still has Jesus on his hands the position is the same for every non-christian , for every unconverted person you still have Jesus on your hand you ca n't get rid of him that easily . ###You can blot him out of your mind for a while , you can go your own way and forget about him , you cannot get rid of Jesus Christ and his claims that easily . 
775582:7	###Well let 's think for just a moment , you know , we 've been talking over these last three or four weeks about faith and that , erm , let 's just think , perhaps and we should have done this sooner , but I dunno , it it fits in th this morning , er perhaps just what , what faith is . ###And like a lot of things , it 's often easier not what it is , but first of all what it is n't . 
775590:57	###I can believe six impossible things before breakfast ! ###And you know , the sad thing is there are an awful lot of Chri faith , that mu that that comes under the realm , to my way of thinking , of mind over matter , that 's the power of positive thinking , that is not biblical faith . 
775620:15	###He says , do you believe that , I am able to do this ? ###So he was focusing their attention on him , and that was the important thing . 
775638:25	###There is not a great depository in heaven , there 's not a huge warehouse , and you come to God and say oh Father ! ###I , increase my faith , give me faith . 
775689:198	###The gift is the faith that God gives to us to receive his forgiveness and his salvation , and his grace as provided . ###You see , God 's grace is provided in Jesus Christ all that I need for salvation . 
775695:28	###I perhaps , of myself , have n't got that faith . ###Nor you , we know , but still , somehow , by some quirk , you may get faith , you may produce it yourself , that gives you an advantage over anybody else . 
775703:61	###Faith then , is the complement of grace . ###All the grace of heaven ! 
775703:84	###Faith then , is the complement of grace . ###All the grace of heaven ! 
775703:101	###Faith then , is the complement of grace . ###All the grace of heaven ! 
775722:9	###But it 's God 's gift to us . ###And the thing is faith , er grace gives , and faith receives . 
775734:11	###Go ahead and take it ! ###God did everything except push them into the land . 
775735:7	###God did everything except push them into the land . ###Because they had to exercise a bit of faith . 
775745:19	###Here they were , a nomadic people they had fled from Egypt from the , from the bondage and tyranny of oppression , and God had provided a land which was flowing with milk and honey , it was theirs ! ###What fools they , you say they were not to go in and possess it ! 
775747:9	###That 's all they had to do . ###Well they 'd see there were problems , you see , faith does n't mean that everything just happens , because faith has gotta do something , faith without works is dead . 
775748:7	###Well they 'd see there were problems , you see , faith does n't mean that everything just happens , because faith has gotta do something , faith without works is dead . ###And they had to go in a do some fighting . 
775787:17	###Wondering , why we ca n't get it , why we ca n't go in . ###And it 's there all the time ! 
775817:43	###Do you remember the er incident when Jesus was , with the disciples in the boat ? ###Now this is one of those interesting incidents because it was one of the times when he tells the disciples off . 
775833:29	###Now , why on earth did Jesus rebuke them ? ###Now let 's be honest here put yourself in their situation , the obvious thing in the storm and th the water comes crashing over , well you do n't really want to fill the boat with water so you start bailing the water out , when you realize you 're not gonna be successful cos more is coming in than you can get out and the storm is not abating , you would naturally get agitated and if for nothing else , at least you can come and help us to bail out ! 
775891:11	###Yeah . ###The other way the inverse is well we got no where did we come from ? 
775937:50	###Right and that 's it straight off good . ###Mhm . 
775982:88	###Okay so if you started off with cos X differentiated it it would give you minus sine X ###Mhm . 
775996:16	###Mhm . ###about differentiating thing what sort of thing did you start off with to finish up with a cos squared three X ? 
776185:48	###You know that you do n't know what you 're doing . ###Yeah . 
776317:23	###And so you could plough that straight back in ###Yeah right . 
776373:9	###If we 'd have started off with this it would have given us twice what we got . ###Yeah . 
776382:47	###But we did n't finish up with twice we ###No . 
776399:103	###Mhm . ###So we only we only need to start off with a third of that . 
776401:7	###Now if we 'd have started off four X cubed minus X all squared we would have two times this lot but we did n't we just got once this so we must have started off this is only a coefficient only a a factor . ###Yeah . 
776407:21	###If I 'd have said , Integrate X cubed . ###Mhm . 
776408:22	###Mhm . ###you 'd think well he must have Integrate X squared . 
776412:32	###That would have given three X squared Well that 's ###Mhm . 
776417:10	###I 've actually got here . ###Now the other thing about an integral really when it boils down to it it 's only a number or a function or a sine or a cos it comes down to you these are just numbers you 're playing with erm 
776418:10	###Now the other thing about an integral really when it boils down to it it 's only a number or a function or a sine or a cos it comes down to you these are just numbers you 're playing with erm ###You 'd have to take that from a half . 
776440:9	###Mhm . ###It should have been that thing squared and now we then having worked it out that far , 
776510:13	###It 's not you you ca n't just have an abstract theory that 's not tied ###Yeah . 
776524:42	###all got a physical model . ###Yeah . 
776787:9	###Right okay if it was X cubed that would have given me three times too much ###Mhm . 
776980:12	###So you 've got to learn now when you can use the similarities and ###Mhm . 
777297:17	###I never though of that one . ###mathematicians a long time but it does help . 
777299:10	###Erm you do n't have to exactly understand the tools that you 're using and how they work but ###Mhm . 
777432:23	###It 's pulling it against the direction we 're measuring S ###Mhm . 
777730:15	###Er and again , you 'll see on one of the ' s photographs I 've got , it shows , just to the right hand side as you 're looking at the front of the main archway , erm it had the legend , Railway , parcels receiving office . ###So if you wanted to er send parcels via the Railway , anywhere in the country , Then you could take your parcels into er the ' s Head er sort of office there , erm and they were ferried down here . 
777805:132	###Erm it was still pretty marginal er but er at least it was opened and erm in eighteen er it carried on until , in eighteen seventy , seventy one , the line was extended back to or a station roughly halfway between the two . ###Then er through to erm , and on to . 
777914:15	###Er massive organization . ###And of course if you strip everything that 's profitable out of it , like the erm er the railway air services went , erm the er the er erm hotels , ferries , everything else you can think of , you 're left with er with a runt that does n't make money , and not surprisingly the government then closes it down .

778007:36	###Er into the er into the bunker . ###In actual fact in later times erm , possibly when that er when this was no longer in use , erm they er put five , instead of two or three coal rails , on the bunker , erm they put five on at least a couple of the engines . 
778215:135	###Now a little bit further up the line , whoops , is junction . ###Now used to be er a link line between erm this er track here , and round the back , erm under Road , there 's still a bridge there , er and joined up near where the rubbish tip is . 
778239:35	###That 's still there . ###Erm where there 's a caravan office , or caravan sales place just by the station , at , sorry at er . 
778334:10	###And it would stop all this problem , but I do n't think we 've got the money for it . ###No . 
778347:28	###Yes . ###Yes . 
778370:29	###Lillie , Lillie , we was playing darts on Monday , came out from the ladies toilets ' and said You ought to see that skirting board , it 's all coming away and rotting . ###She obviously uses it each week , so it 's all rotted all coming away at the back of the pan . 
778377:9	###Well I think the roof is an emergency . ###Done first . . 
778416:28	###What you complaining about Rose . ###And she wo n't send them over to me . . 
778422:21	###And , and they 're all sort of preserved and they 're all to bring down clean . ###But er , I could ask him . 
778485:36	###Margaret ? ###Well I 'm still treasurer at the bowls club and I do n't feel that I want to take on two . 
778532:32	###I set out the views of the membership below . ###One , many of our members are elderly and managing on very small incomes and any increase in the s in the subscription is likely to mean that we shall lose members . 
778534:10	###This is particularly true in this area where we have to compete with the Townswomen 's Guild which has a lower subscription and also with numerous Council-run activities , many of which are free or at a low cost for pensioners . ###Two , our institute has its own hall and as this is now about seventy years old and was not particularly well built in the first place , you will understand that it costs us a good deal in money and effort to literally keep the roof over our heads . 
778545:88	###The vast majority of members are recruited at local level by word of mouth and very , very few by the image-making publicity generated at national level . ###Please let us keep more of this subscription at local level so that we can provide the service that is required . 
778551:33	###That alright ? ###Have you sent that Rose ? 
778567:118	###Cos of uncertainty about the arrangement over long period , decided to opt for one-year-only subscription . ###The second difficult decision to be made was what the subscription should be . 
778569:46	###There were various factors to be taken into account when determining the actual amount , previously the subscription adding and the fact that there had been no increase in the second year when inflation in increased considerably had to be taken into account . ###Secondly the decision is a nineteen ninety one budget by the Chancellor of the Exchequer who raised the level of the Value Added Tax to seventeen and a half per cent from fifteen per cent hit the income of the majority of County Federation and certainly the National Federation because Customs and Excise when VAT was introduced ruled that the annual subscriptions was made VATable . 
778576:11	###The National Federation was determined not to re-introduce the quota and equally determined to try and help the Institute financially . ###As a er result it was agreed to give the larger share of new subscription to Institutes , in actual fact Institutes received an increase of twenty nine point sixty two per cent . 
778621:12	###Yes . ###Put on 
778621:54	###Yes . ###Put on 
778629:10	###you know . ###Mm . 
778654:33	###Birmingham . ###They 're Birmingham . 
778667:9	###Pat part qualified . ###Oh no , no . 
778682:9	###No , Derek would tell us . ###Yeah . 
778687:22	###Mm . ###So all of you that have expenses . 
778691:154	###It 's alright . ###Carry on . 
778779:34	###Well ah , we can mention it at the meeting , but I mean it 's too late really and er anyhow I should n't think anyone will go . ###Surely . 
778781:65	###If they do n't go then our diaries and calendars will have to be . ###There 's something else I might be able to . 
778812:13	###Oh yes , they only want two so that would be you and a treasurer . ###Well I mean you could go with the new treasurer , but they would drive , so erm . 
778813:36	###Well I mean you could go with the new treasurer , but they would drive , so erm . ###We 'll just have to wait and see for . 
778889:10	###No , it sound a good idea if it do n't fall apart nearer the time . ###Yes , this is the only thing . 
778901:23	###Then perhaps you would then , Janet . ###Right . 
778928:29	###I mean this , you , could you pay yours today ? ###Well we paid sixteen pounds altogether . 
778937:13	###And that 's all to do with students ' union . ###I mean your class is much cheaper than the one I go to . 
778937:83	###And that 's all to do with students ' union . ###I mean your class is much cheaper than the one I go to . 
778950:80	###You enrol . ###Anyhow if you 're interested and want to write . 
778958:9	###Blessed are they who sit quietly with their eyes modestly cast downwards , saying nothing , volunteering nothing , for they are the majority of W I members . ###True , very true . 
778992:24	###Did anyone else see it it was very good , very good . ###Well if you throw it over to the meeting , all of those would come would only be interested would n't they ? which is what you want . 
779005:51	###Mm , if you would n't mind Sheila anyway , thank you . ###Erm , the carol festivals are on and there 's one at Thaxted , which might be quite nice , actually , erm it 's on the same page , the previous column And someone 's just taken a driving test at ninety one . 
779009:39	###Erm passed this evening . ###Erm choir , forty five pounds , forty four P , Eastern Electricity thirty eight pounds , twenty three , Peter , the builders , for the new sink , four hundred and ninety one pounds and fifteen P and Eastern Gas , eleven pounds , twenty seven . 
779037:12	###masking . ###That 's all over the pipe is n't it . 
779044:15	###Yes , but you can get yeah . ###I mean they 're not , they would n't cost a lot . 
779076:11	###Yeah ###Sixty five pounds and twelve pence . 
779093:67	###No they , they usually keep it . . ###Hold it over I think , do n't you . 
779137:35	###Yes . ###to save in this way . 
779248:19	###Which is ? ###I will pick them up then . 
779251:34	###No , so you could tell them . ###So , I I thought it would be best if the diaries and calendars were ordered in September because the Home and Country orders er are the next month and that might be . 
779456:12	###Can I ask if you . ###It 's a the meeting date for December . 
779484:77	###Yes , I think so . ###And sort of gasp , the . 
779493:46	###Yes okay , lovely . ###Now going back to this handicraft , although I said I really did n't want to be committed to all the meetings , I 'm quite happy to carry on with the handicraft , providing you do n't expect me to turn up at every meeting . 
779499:15	###I think how we organise ourselves is up to the president and the committee . ###That 's what I said , but I think Vera , erm yes Vera is . 
779563:78	###Jim came out . ###Yeah , yeah . 
779564:7	###Yeah , yeah . ###Well I 'll , I 'll try and get down on Monday and see what she says and I say you know she must do three hours on Mondays . 
779566:7	###What must she do , what is it five hours a week ? ###She 's paid for five hours a week , three on a Monday , one on Wednesday and one on Friday , that 's what she 's supposed to do . 
779592:80	###I do n't see how she can do the hours , with the hours that she 's doing , I mean she 's still in the Penny Farthing when I came here cos I went to pay her the money . ###You went into the Penny Farthing ? 
779601:10	###Well , Joan and Sheila there 've been taking cobwebs down and things like that you know and then paying her to do it . ###Well I will go and have words and I 'll report back to you . 
779602:40	###Well I will go and have words and I 'll report back to you . ###You 'll have to come down early . 
779619:49	###I mean it is a bind , and , and it is n't very pleasant given somebody the sack either . ###No . 
779724:49	###Mm . ###quickly and easily . 
779742:12	###That 's right . ###Mm . 
779869:15	###It 's still ###Mm . 
780293:12	###Yes . ###Yes . 
780519:11	###You know , because ###Mm . 
780564:29	###You 've lost your place now , have n't you ? ###I have indeed , it 's serendipity we 've got to have n't we ? 
780844:28	###Mm ###er have any advantage in that . 
780874:66	###yeah . ###It will have an improvement but I , I think we get that almost for free . 
780878:35	###So all I 'm saying is that that 's what we should expect to see . ###Now the r the truth is , what we 've gotta now check out , is actually is that reality , is the reality wildly out . 
780912:15	###Well in er I think you 've gotta weigh up the p the productivity element against the cost , cost of it . ###cost effectiveness 
780912:32	###Well in er I think you 've gotta weigh up the p the productivity element against the cost , cost of it . ###cost effectiveness 
780927:21	###If X is cheaper than Y then you 've got your case . ###Then you ban the weekday overtime . 
780947:16	###Okay ? ###So that then we can actually get somebody in there that can do the job properly . 
780949:29	###And then we 'll have to deal with that other one and er and , and resolve that one way or the other and make , make sure we 've done that reasonably reasonably quickly , either g sending her back to new business or er trying to find another position for her if she ca n't actually cope with that . ###Mm . 
780951:62	###Erm the J C one we 'll have to try and deal with that again as a separate issue but I do n't , I mean the amount of time we 're losing from high levels of sickness we talked about a c couple of meetings or so ago , about the absence levels with some people , we 've just gotta make sure we crack that on the head , we 're just haemorrhaging money , the fact that it is not just hours it 's money . ###We should be getting another one out soon should n't we , end of March ? 
780972:9	###The question is by how much . ###Now 
780975:16	###We do n't wanna l no . ###But I think , but I do think it does mean that the first thing we say is that the work is more important than some of , maybe some of the , the nicer to have three year projects at the moment . 
780976:155	###But I think , but I do think it does mean that the first thing we say is that the work is more important than some of , maybe some of the , the nicer to have three year projects at the moment . ###And that 's gonna have to be some of the things that suffer . 
780977:18	###And that 's gonna have to be some of the things that suffer . ###If for example you 've got a problem with productivity in your patch , erm because of the , the reasons we 've talked about , it does mean that perhaps you need to say to whoever has been , is off and doing other projects that they 'll have to stop doing that until you 've got the productivity up till you can release them back again . 
780977:148	###And that 's gonna have to be some of the things that suffer . ###If for example you 've got a problem with productivity in your patch , erm because of the , the reasons we 've talked about , it does mean that perhaps you need to say to whoever has been , is off and doing other projects that they 'll have to stop doing that until you 've got the productivity up till you can release them back again . 
781175:27	###Erm in March the top branch was erm Hugh erm interestingly enough erm in the south erm Nicholas erm was well down on recruitment , he was down minus twenty seven on his fore on his target , but was significantly up on his bus business that he brought in because they 've been focusing on er in on that . ###But erm the conversations I 've had yesterday indicate that they are doing a major push on recruitment . 
781192:52	###What we telling them to increase to ? ###That I 've said erm if you take into account inflation at five percent which they , they , although they 're not , have n't put it in concrete , they reckon they 're gonna link it to inflation , erm that should be , in thirty years time , about five pounds . 
781298:36	###No sense in that . ###it 's an ongoing thing . 
781331:18	###No use looking at me I have n't got any answers for it ###er 
781378:15	###Pensions would have , yeah . ###would be slightly different because they , we 'd only be collecting a part of the premium we would n't be collecting their investment part if that 's in arrears . 
781444:20	###Yeah . ###It does n't work by winding anything on , 
781475:15	###And we 'll just ###Yeah we 're giving them three months notice , if we can do that quickly 
781477:32	###And each team 'll have to do a hundred ###Well each team , that means we 're gonna , we 've got overtime then for 
781524:59	###I , I , I , I should say they need to go off no they need , they need to go off , off , off team ###Mm . 
781540:38	###Well th they 're al they 're already snowed under with calls , if you 've got another ten thousand cases and , and e the teams will have all the information , they 'll have the reports you see . ###I do n't think the arrears , when they , when it occurred is on the report 
781582:59	###No no , oh no . ###erm if that does come about but it 's , it 's an issue . 
781598:19	###Er no th th for anything that they run this week , they 'll be redirected in in-house , so we should be getting er about forty of those statements in tomorrow and forty the next day . ###And then they 'll be reproduced ? 
781599:11	###And then they 'll be reproduced ? ###And then what we 'll have to do , th the unit statement 's perfectly okay , the benefit statement all you 've got to do is get the benefit statement retyped but with a different premium in at renewal date . 
781607:90	###So you 'd rather go ahead and just make numbers involved . ###Yeah . 
781641:7	###Yeah . ###Super . 
781643:34	###I had to use it for one of Andy ###That 's worth knowing is n't it , in case 
781683:165	###With a valid er ###Right , okay . 
781762:19	###Well once they 've got the valuations in and switches and it 's not till June ###No well we might well it might be that we say we want a combined party , I do n't know , 
781773:13	###Presumably we , are we charging staff for this ? ###Are we charging staff for it ? 
781775:21	###We wo n't have to pay for it will we ? ###Or are we getting it out of our own budget ? 
781964:10	###We 'll just check that see if it 's right . ###Yeah that 's fine . 
782041:9	###You would n't spend any . ###Okay that 's fine you put presents none . 
782061:27	###Mm . ###So adds up very nicely to three sixty and Kelly spent more than she had . 
782116:9	###special name for it as Kelly says ###a right angle , right . 
782116:27	###special name for it as Kelly says ###a right angle , right . 
782219:12	###Well you ca n't do it from there because that would mean you 're spending ###you 've got one ninety pence here and you 're spending ninety pence of it on one thing and sixty pence of the same money on another thing . 
782260:14	###Yeah ? ###Are you stuck . 
782317:59	###Three of those and she spends one of them ###she spends one of them on stationery and she saves one of them . 
782394:30	###Go on you 've got the right idea do n't be afraid to say it . ###Mm 
782661:21	###So ten times something gave us three sixty ten times what ? ###Thirty six . 
782890:95	###That looks right . ###How m and this is wha you worked all the way round now how much have you got left over ? 
782912:54	###Yeah . ###it 's one pound eighty and it 's just gonna be half 
782939:10	###find ###So once you knew wh how many degrees it was for each slice of the pie in your pie chart no problem to use your protractor and mark off forty eight degrees , a hundred and forty four , seventy two , thirty six 
783165:17	###Okay . ###Now what I 'd like you to do is to look at these numbers this is a bit like erm have you seen Countdown ? 
783166:7	###Now what I 'd like you to do is to look at these numbers this is a bit like erm have you seen Countdown ? ###Carol Vorderman where you have to make numbers ? 
783193:15	###And you got a nine there times a five would make forty five . ###Well if you do n't spot that it 's no h it 's no help really you ca n't just think , Oh well I 'll just sit there until it comes into my head . 
783204:69	###ten . ###Ten is one of its factor . 
783206:7	###But if it ended in , if ten is one of its factors then there 's a num another number that must be one of its factors . ###Five . 
783206:27	###But if it ended in , if ten is one of its factors then there 's a num another number that must be one of its factors . ###Five . 
783262:51	###Okay ? ###Four time so if someone says what 's a quarter of all the way round you can look at all of these and you can think , well four times ninet four times what would be all the way round ? 
783373:51	###Thank you very much . ###Erm I 'll just sort this out . 
783445:49	###Yeah . ###Mm . 
783512:13	###wonderful job . ###Erm 
783514:10	###Yeah you 'd have to work for Deborah then ###Yeah . 
783516:12	###You 'd have to work for Deborah you 'd love that . ###I know and to be quite honest with you the other day 
783540:42	###Yes it 's being asked all the time . ###Because Alan said it would be I know . 
783575:9	###Oh yes yes . ###That 's quite a good idea is n't it ? 
783682:12	###Yes . ###And I 
783700:9	###Yes ###Yeah . 
783975:126	###Not that quite a few . ###quite a lot at the moment but hopefully wo n't shortly . 
783978:9	###Thank God for that . ###Wo n't happen to j 
783978:46	###Thank God for that . ###Wo n't happen to j 
783989:12	###The three wise monkeys . ###They sit in a long line in York , yeah ? 
783991:14	###We do n't have to mention names . ###The one thing that 
784040:15	###And social services will be able to advise on that . ###Mm . 
784081:54	###But I you know hopeful I know that th th th quite a large and high numbers but what we agreed was if we were working on the basis of something like on one person every six weeks ###Mm . 
784115:13	###The form complete is much easier than the the ###Is it ? 
784115:29	###The form complete is much easier than the the ###Is it ? 
784240:42	###Yeah . ###Mentioning no names . 
784240:66	###Yeah . ###Mentioning no names . 
784311:115	###Say you 'll actually negotiate that in , in the erm preliminary meeting ###Mm . 
784319:16	###you know I think she would do . ###But that 's the sort of negotiation 
784335:74	###I found it invaluable last time I was doing i b you know if , if you say to somebody y you know come beforehand with what you 're doing well , what , where the difficulties are , what the obstacles are . ###And they came and you know I find it difficult here , here and here . 
784368:20	###Yeah . ###And I 've not looked at them since I wrote them . 
784370:21	###But you know that you have to , you know you ca n't just ###But I know I 've got to . 
784370:43	###But you know that you have to , you know you ca n't just ###But I know I 've got to . 
784396:9	###Mm mm . ###it 's this fear , insecurity when you 
784397:12	###it 's this fear , insecurity when you ###when have to do it , yeah . 
784414:9	###That 's the prioritized ###Yes . 
784416:24	###Cos you have to negotiate ###But also an another target would be to identify , let 's say a careers officer or a more experienced E O . 
784444:9	###of those things And , and ###write down on the target sheet . 
784508:12	###to do it right otherwise it 's ###Well that 's right , that 's right . 
784510:12	###I 'm gonna have to do it ###Yeah . 
784556:12	###er Teresa and Liz were the three of us that were . ###Obviously we did n't , he can get a third when we can only get , when there were only two of us because there were n't enough , enough threes to go round and I mean 
784558:7	###Yeah So I must admit ###Mm . 
784636:13	###You know say if you 've got a number of E O saying well I would like training in this ###Yes . 
784841:8	###you know who ###Mm . 
784889:60	###Mm . ###Which is not perhaps a very good use of time . 
784942:74	###The problem is the government said that non- commercial undertakings as they define them , local authorities , health authorities and the Civil Service were exempt from the regulations . ###This was along with their miscarried philosophy of private sector good , public sector bad . 
784954:27	###The reason I joined the G M B and I 'm sure most of you was , in good times the G M B looks for improvements in pay and conditions , in bad times we look for holding on to what we have got . ###This gives us the chance , this helps us but that 's all it does . 
784981:29	###Er , women workers mainly part- time and school cleaning and school meal services have had fundamental changes in the conditions of service . ###Privatization for our members has meant more work for less pay with less people and with less time to complete the work . 
784988:14	###Whilst computing was the cowboy contractors in in order for our members to keep their jobs hours have been cut , bonuses have been cut and arrangements for a working year have been changed and many many other things have been altered in order for people to save their jobs within local authority services . ###Compulsory competitive tendering is not the way forward , what is needed is quality services provided by a quality workforce . 
785014:12	###It also makes local government less attractive employer . ###We in the public services provide a higher standard of efficiency and quality , in fact we provide a service that 's second to none . 
785044:49	###Avril , South Western Region seconding composite thirteen . ###President , Conference motion two nine six condemns this government 's scandalously low spending levels imposed on local authorities causing drastic cutbacks in social services , who provides facilities for society 's most vulnerable citizens , the old , sick and disabled .

785110:85	###For many weeks prior to the first of February we attempted to get a district council , a Labour council to agree that should apply in the case . ###They refused on the advice from the Department of the Environment . 
785119:38	###We have obtained much support locally from other trade unionists and residents , we are attempting to meet the leaders of the Labour group . ###We are now at the crossroad , we need wider support and help both moral and financial and there will be a bucket collection at the end of this session .

785246:90	###Thank you President and Congress for granting me the honour to report back on behalf of the ten G M B Members in the European Parliament . ###We make up more than a fifth of the European Parliamentary Labour Group in Europe , which in turn forms a quarter of the socialist group the biggest political block in the European Parliament and G M B Members cover the full range of parliamentary committees over the years we feel that a vast range of queries and questions whizzed by the G M B membership . 
785298:127	###We should instead encourage them to press ahead , because it is a temporary difficulty , the clock is ticking towards the day when John Smith is Prime Minister , will convert that opt-out into an opt-in . ###Second , the opt-out will soon begin to fray at the edges .

785323:78	###Colleagues , er there are a number of motions that I have mentioned on Europe the first one being motion four one O , the Treaty on European Union be moved by Southern Region . ###Congress , Mr President Steven Southern Region moving motion four one O on the Maastricht Treaty . 
785338:20	###Steven mentioned the constraints that the E M U may impose on the economy , but the biggest single issue is the scandalous position in which this government has placed British workers by opting out of a Social Chapter and thus denying the right and protection at work which are granted , taken for granted as minimum basic conditions in all other member states . ###But as Steven also said , this was no reason for Labour to vote against the Treaty .

785342:21	###The Treaty is not written on tablets of stone , it allows for changes and improvements as early as nineteen ninety six . ###Our European priorities now should be to campaign for the sort of policies and changes we would like to see in nineteen ninety six and seek the earliest possible opt-in to the Social Chapter . 
785358:41	###The easiest way we can get back into the Social Chapter is to accept Maastricht , without Maastricht there is no Social Chapter , with Maastricht we can opt back in to the Social Chapter . ###Now a couple of weeks ago a man called Mr Lamont actually resigned I understand or was he sacked I 'm not quite sure , but when he disappeared off the scene , Mr Major said I am still keeping forward with my policies . 
785445:10	###I am not sure at the moment if the labour are sure if they would work under the Labour government . ###As of the Tories as we 're not going to for non-trade unions where employees are hand-picked by their employer . 
785455:7	###If multi-national companies exist and dividing frontiers against workers for their own games we should organize , cooperate and perhaps even amalgamate to resist the combat , to co to combat common problems and disputes second or third class nation will not service British workers but will undermine the nations . ###We would not and do not like them ma manipulation and extortion of workers anywhere in the world . 
785468:19	###The opening of East European borders has provided new opportunities for rampant free-marketeering and with it the exploitation of the workers in these countries . ###Right- wing politicians including our own Tory Party and those with even more dubious cre credentials and European employers are already active and working under the guise of economic liberators and democratizers . 
785475:20	###It is incumbent on us to be part of this assistance , whether it be financial , practical or political . ###The consequences of ignoring their plight will not only weaken them , but it will strengthen employers as they take the opportunity to export jobs to wherever labour is cheapest and protection weakest . 
785476:10	###The consequences of ignoring their plight will not only weaken them , but it will strengthen employers as they take the opportunity to export jobs to wherever labour is cheapest and protection weakest . ###West German trade unions have already had to take action to re to prevent their government from denying equal conditions to workers in the former East Germany . 
785492:12	###A competition for companies to follow the cheapest labour could well ensue and the loser , the labour force , both East and West . ###The input from our union er , suggested by the motion is needed now . 
785494:8	###Eastern European workers must be informed on what to expect and how best to deal with it . ###The need for that is plain , the time for that is now . 
785494:28	###Eastern European workers must be informed on what to expect and how best to deal with it . ###The need for that is plain , the time for that is now . 
785504:59	###As the President said the C E C are asking you to support four one O , four one three er with the qualification I 'll give you later four one four and four one five and er just thank you Linda for making me write up all the notes about that resolution and pulling out at the last minute . ###Thank you very much mate , very pleased . 
785557:153	###But to our disgust , and as Nigel mentioned , also that we have seen a demise of factory inspectors , and this is borne out by the fact that figures at the present time show that an average workplace can be expected to be visited once in eleven years . ###There can be no doubt in anybody 's eyes that the failure of the H S E to enforce the law along with unscrupulous employers , exploiting low inspection rates , mean that the role played by G M B safety reps and those who provide our backup service , are more important than ever before .

785567:34	###Tom ###President , er Congress , Tom , Liverpool , North Wales and Irish region Congress , it is well known in the trade union movements that the G M B is the leader on health , safety and environmental issues . 
785582:14	###Such is the U K 's contribution to European Year of Health and Safety . ###The government are failing in their duty to protect people , the employers are failing in their duty to protect people . 
785593:158	###Erm , there was a specific point raise re raised from Lancashire region , regarding briefing sessions for branch secretaries . ###That is our intention , er we are organizing briefing sessions for officers , and taking an approach which we want to get the information distributed to the workplace and that is clearly an area that we wanna develop . 
785630:36	###But maybe if we did this exercise , countrywide , and enough people exer exerted pressure , then possibly we could force this government to do yet another famous U-turn , and start to inject some real money into the N H S . ###Just think what we could achieve with enough investment . 
785642:43	###Thanks very much indeed . ###Kevin

785740:61	###Who ca n't be bothered to read health warnings on cigarette packets let alone tampon packets . ###We have to reach them , but how ? 
785741:40	###We have to reach them , but how ? ###If you 're a school governor or a member of a P T A or just a parent , you must demand that the real facts of life and death are part of sex and hygiene education .

785773:80	###When I first heard about it , someone said to me , within the next ten years , one of ten of us will know of someone who 's died from it . ###That was about six years ago , I heard that , and I 've heard of one person already that I 've personally met . 
785775:48	###We 've all come to use the word condom in public conversation and nobody gets embarrassed about that any more , and that 's what has to happen now . ###Condoms are something that everyone uses every day . 
785791:7	###It somewhat shook me rigid , and through my colleague , Peggy who received a gold award this week , we got some of those leaflets , that were sent to us , and Peggy wrote a letter , around to the workplaces in Grimsby and Cleethorpes , and as a role , as trade union liaison officer with Grimsby C L P , she sent it to the workplaces within Grimsby . ###When I raised it as Chairman at the General Management Committee , I was disgusted to find that people laughed at the very subject that was so important to women who 've come up here today to let us know the consequences of what was happening . 
785801:49	###President , Congress , I 'm Morag , G M B Scotland , moving motion two six one . ###It 's hormone replacement the therapy , it 's better known as H R T . 
785827:108	###Motion two six nine , Yorkshire . ###Maureen , Yorkshire , North D Derbyshire region speaking in support of motion two six nine , Working Women 's Safety . 
785828:7	###Maureen , Yorkshire , North D Derbyshire region speaking in support of motion two six nine , Working Women 's Safety . ###There has been a marked increase in the number of women working in isolated areas and the G M B has been campaigning for improvements in safety on public transport , a campaign which must continue . 
785831:43	###If employees , employers put the same importance on the safety and security of their fav female employees as they do on the security of their property , there would probably be an instant improvement . ###Women who work in community are particularly at risk , housing wardens and particularly home care assistants , who work in some of the worst inner city areas are very often called out at night to attend someone who has been taken ill and yet no thought is given to the potential danger they could be facing in carrying out their job or what , to or what preventive measures can be taken . 
785870:27	###President , colleagues , as most of you are aware I work in the food industry , in , in this industry the majority are female . ###Some of the horror stories that I hear are horrendous , but I want to tell you three issues that I do actually know about . 
785880:20	###She turned to the union . ###The G M B , who have taken up her case , which is still ongoing today . 
785881:7	###The G M B , who have taken up her case , which is still ongoing today . ###President , colleagues , this harassment has got to be stopped . 
785894:18	###Sue , speaking on behalf of the C E C and it 's nice to be back , and it 's nice to be feeling well again . ###In respect of these erm motions , I 'd like to make a couple of points on each one . 
785896:28	###The cancer screening , everybody must remember as Kevin said on the toxic shock erm motion , that it 's your wife , your sister , your daughter who needs the cancer screening , the same thing applies to the toxic shock syndrome . ###It applies to health right across the board . 
785922:7	###Keith , Midland and East Coast region , moving composite motion five . ###President , Congress calls upon all regions within the G M B to ensure that all safety reps and activists are supplied with all relevant information and details regarding the introduction of the new E E C directives on health and safety , which was introduced in the U K in January this year . 
785947:21	###This provides background knowledge so that often not only spots a hazard , but actually saves a life . ###Congress , our laws are weakened at the Tories request , and recent announcements that the public funding of trade union education is to be stopped has even brought a c cry of outrage from the Health and Safety Executive . 
785947:59	###This provides background knowledge so that often not only spots a hazard , but actually saves a life . ###Congress , our laws are weakened at the Tories request , and recent announcements that the public funding of trade union education is to be stopped has even brought a c cry of outrage from the Health and Safety Executive . 
785970:73	###We can then be involved in the setting of performance indicators and carrying out audits , much like we carry out our safety inspections , and that way we may be able to work on joint policies on the environment . ###But you all may be thinking , that is all well and good , but where are we going to find the time , the support , and the resources to do this . 
786032:22	###This is ridiculous . ###The pain from this condition is the same whatever the cause . 
786033:13	###The pain from this condition is the same whatever the cause . ###Everyone knows that you do n't have to play tennis to suffer from tennis elbow , likewise carpal tunnel is not the cause by vibrating hand tools . 
786037:49	###We need a common and comprehensive list of prescribed industrial diseases and a common procedure for dealing with them . ###Anyone confirmed as suffering from a prescribed industrial disease should receive compensation for their condition without having to wait for the findings of a long drawn-out court arguments . 
786052:64	###As long as they exist , we call on safety reps to have the legal right to stop the job without fear of intimidation or victimization . ###The G M B also want employers who flout the law to be properly punished , not a slap on the wrist which many hand out , we want imprisonment for serious offenders , and fines which will make potential offenders think twice before cutting corners and putting our members at risk . 
786107:72	###At that conference , there was a motion from Merseyside , recognizing the shift in the T U C 's position , but asking for what we 're asking for today . ###Let me quote you part of that motion . 
786125:72	###He also said , I mean groups of people who are not answerable to wider collective membership . ###Of course we 're answerable . 
786202:42	###We did have that for a while , and we remember with pride , how the country was rebuilt and our health service was the envy of the world . ###Our children were fit and had opportunities for travel and a university education was there for those that wanted it . 
786209:9	###We have adopted aims that may not win the war against poverty , but we hope we 'll win battles to ease the burden on those older pensioners , especially those living alone on low incomes . ###Such battles as the abolition of additional charges made on telephones , gas and electricity bills , and now to add insult to injury , V A T . 
786210:59	###Such battles as the abolition of additional charges made on telephones , gas and electricity bills , and now to add insult to injury , V A T . ###This government have to be made to realize what a cruel blow it has struck on the very weakest sections of the community , the unemployed and the five and half million pensioners living in poverty . 
786217:7	###Our present campaign is waged against targeting or means testing of benefits and pensions . ###We maintain that the pension is not a charity or a benefit , but is our right as something we pay contributions for all our working lives . 
786219:7	###This must be preserved ###Hear hear 
786238:206	###Yes , colleagues , er colleagues who 've attended conference before will know , that whenever we come to a conference town to have our Congress , we always like to leave something behind as a gift to the local community . ###This year , Mary , vice- President , and I , together with Eddie and Derek , representing the Southern region , went to St Peter 's Centre , which is a day centre for people suffering from Alzheimer 's disease , towards the north of Portsmouth , to contribute our cheque of a thousand pounds , which is going towards the extension of the centre . 
786290:82	###Now , it 's now my pleasure to welcome on your behalf Chris the Secretary of Portsmouth Trades Council . ###Chris has been Secretary for Trades Council for ten years , he 's a W E A tutor , that 's his er profession , he 's an organizer , and he organizes courses throughout Hampshire and the Isle of Wight . 
786295:96	###Just a very warm welcome on behalf of the G M B please address our conference . ###Thank you Dick . 
786335:51	###Engineering employment in the first half of nineteen ninety three is estimated to be a hundred and twenty thousand fewer than twelve months earlier and it is forecast to fall another forty five thousand in the next twelve months . ###Two years ago , Norman Lamont gave the uncaring Conservative view on unemployment . 
786359:7	###There will be the closures and mothballing of pits , there will be a reduction of Apex jobs under the reorganization now taking place and steps towards privatization will begin . ###Colleagues , the government 's inertia in tackling the crisis in industry stems from the fact that it has convinced itself , if not the general public , that there is no problem . 
786388:30	###Congress , I think it 's only right to draw to your attention that in item five B USDAW that at the last USDAW Conference there was a motion passed saying that there should be recognition for the independent trade union within USDAW which is ourselves , G M B Apex . ###However since that time , there has been no recognition granted by USDAW , the main reason for which is the General Secretary , who allegedly had said that because his organization is not a profit making organization , there is no reason to have a trade union there . 
786389:62	###However since that time , there has been no recognition granted by USDAW , the main reason for which is the General Secretary , who allegedly had said that because his organization is not a profit making organization , there is no reason to have a trade union there . ###Now these are the kind of people we have to deal with and I know Duncan has a problem in USDAW there 's Gerry the negotiator for the London Region . 
786396:171	###Ron as far as the Saudi claim is concerned you will be aware that I have written to all regions explaining the reason why we have not presented a claim , no other union has presented a claim in British Coal and if we do present a claim at this point in time , I 'll tell you what the answer will be . ###That answer will be that we , they , th British Coal will not give an increase this year . 
786400:85	###I am aware he has met on a number of occasions with our members , and he was instrumental in selecting a team , which met with the General Secretary of USDAW who said that they had had a er a er reasonable meeting with him . ###We 're now hoping to get a resolution to that problem . 
786431:31	###My own experience , my own area , we have Harry , he had cancer hospital no family , he had a home carer for two hours a day , he lasted two days and died . ###Nay and I call that an injustice . 
786466:10	###Unemployed centres are underfunded and closed , so the only hope left is us , the trade union movement . ###I know some regions send messages out to their members who 've just lost their jobs , expressing hope that they desire please stay with us , we can help ya . 
786468:8	###This we must do , we 've gotta help our unemployed members because some of those who are unemployed have been some of our best fighters and they 're still in there fighting despite the fact they have n't their jobs . ###We 've gotta support these colleagues . 
786468:24	###This we must do , we 've gotta help our unemployed members because some of those who are unemployed have been some of our best fighters and they 're still in there fighting despite the fact they have n't their jobs . ###We 've gotta support these colleagues . 
786499:44	###President , congress , Roy , moving motion two eight three Workfare . ###The word workfare is a term we have imported from America , the America , where if you are unemployed , homeless , you 're a scrounger , a drop-out a no-good , something less than human . 
786562:12	###The one certain thing is that workfare has no place in the economic policy of a civilized country . ###That 's why we urge you to support composite ten and motion two eight three . 
786612:9	###For another thing the most profitable processes today simply do not need large amounts of labour and is it seriously expected by the government that as long as we avoid being tied down by the social chapter , we shall become such a reservoir of cheap labour , that we shall become cheaper and more exploitable than the labour force in the Third World ? ###Is that the way we are to become competitive again ? 
786631:94	###Mind you , you in the trade unions and in the Labour Party are no worse than anyone else . ###That 's where Christianity comes in again actually solidarity 
786634:8	###and I should warn you that once I was asked to go to a , a series of lectures in a certain cathedral on the seven deadly sins , because the Canon who invited me said he wanted a married man who was good on lust ! ###Against it that is 
786634:31	###and I should warn you that once I was asked to go to a , a series of lectures in a certain cathedral on the seven deadly sins , because the Canon who invited me said he wanted a married man who was good on lust ! ###Against it that is 
786642:8	###Of course , we cannot just get out of the routines and struggles and problems we are already engaged in . ###It 's important for instance to guard safety at work . 
786665:53	###Have we become so depressed about any real prospect of newness that we 've decided to enjoy our chains , masochistically dwelling on our miseries and inadequacies ? ###Is it beyond the wit , guts and grace of ordinary men and women to re-assemble in fresher alliances on the basis of fresh thinking ? 
786673:11	###It is surely obvious that we cannot go on as we are as we pollute the world and as poverty increases , along with violence , vandalism and random destruction , more of it at Gateshead last night apparently . ###We have immense technological and communication resources . 
786673:24	###It is surely obvious that we cannot go on as we are as we pollute the world and as poverty increases , along with violence , vandalism and random destruction , more of it at Gateshead last night apparently . ###We have immense technological and communication resources . 
786682:161	###We need to restore a whole range of intermediate institutions , unions come in here as do professional organizations , healthy , local democratic government and voluntary and charitable bodies , not to mention the churches . ###Such bodies are needed to break up centralized power to encourage participation and restore morale to ordinary people by convincing them that they do count , that they are listened to and that they can participate . 
786683:39	###Such bodies are needed to break up centralized power to encourage participation and restore morale to ordinary people by convincing them that they do count , that they are listened to and that they can participate . ###In short , restoring ordinary people as part of the we who run things , rather than the them for obstacles to be regulated , managed , I fear even duped and certainly simply left out , and the chief place to focus our search for pragmatic coalitions and cooperative democracy must be in our local communities . 
786686:33	###I am personally impressed and encouraged by what is going on in some of the hardest hit areas in my part of the world and by a series of what you might call chance accident , we 've actually got a sign on it on the platform here . ###Were you to turn over that banner which is I think magnificently designed , you would find the other side is entirely about international connections between workers and various groups and so on , so it 's got the international , the wider version and I 'm delighted to to know that you have here , you I understand that the G M B is perhaps the only body which has the nearest thing to a formal alliance with the trade union in Germany I mean this is tremendous . 
786689:123	###So I , I was very moved to find that this has arrived and I do n't think it 's romantic nonsense , I think it is related to the business of getting people together locally . ###People are realizing that you just cannot expect much of them and that one way of improving local lives is to get together in local communities and groups and participating wider area networks and in such coalitions of people , th th they manage to keep some sort of community spirit and activity going .

786705:33	###Yet in almost every workplace in Britain we all know there are people who are willing to receive all the benefits of working in a trade union workplace , but too unknown to their colleagues , refuse to pay the costs . ###Such people colleagues are usually the first to voice their concerns , first to criticize union officials , yet secretly at the end of each week , their pay packet shows no deductions for trade union fees . 
786753:37	###The singer had fought and won his battles against bulimia , drug and alcohol abuse and had publicly spoken about it to help others get over the nightmare of addiction . ###He said the Sunday Mirror had offered to publish an apology but Elton John had rejected it because the paper had recklessly published the article . 
786755:78	###Aid workers in central Bosnia have told the United Nations it must act to protect more than a thousand Moslems trapped in the Croatian controlled enclave of Vareys . ###The warning follows last week 's massacre of at least twenty five people in the nearby village of . 
786758:97	###He was asked what U N peace keepers were doing to protect Moslem civilians in the area . ###What is happening is they 're patrolling the areas intensively , they 're maintaining contact with these er terrified Moslems to try to avert any type of er foul play in the area . 
786768:7	###So we 're the first to have them after them gaining number one . ###On the hour the news and weather and we 'd like to hear from you this afternoon Nottingham three four three four three four the number to ring if you 'd like to have a chat on the air . 
786772:51	###Give us a ring , Nottingham three four three four three four . ###And we have a competition it 's spot the singer it 's quite simple when you know the singer it is anyway . 
786854:24	###No no all right thanks for trying . ###Bye 
786933:56	###It takes a lot of earning . ###Yeah I bet it does . 
787107:16	###Is it ? ###Fillet steak is is just a regular meal over there . 
787114:36	###Yeah wonderful wonderful food . ###So if you had the chance you 'd have stayed there ? 
787197:92	###I had I saved for three years . ###How much ? 
787248:59	###Ah well you know that 's strange cos ours used to carry everything into her basket which and would ###No 
787436:86	###Then all of a sudden these strange people started coming out of record companies who were involved in the video end of it and deciding this is what we should do with that song and sort of you know these were songs that we had planned and recorded and and all of a sudden these people were changing them . ###So now what 's happening is we 're before we 're doing an album we sit down and we pick out a lot of songs we decide right you know we need songs with good story books so the video is near enough planned with the recording of the song and it it 's a lot easier for us and a lot more enjoyable enough a lot more enjoyable . 
787439:167	###Oh absolutely yes very very important ###It 's all to do with marketing . 
787454:88	###Wherever you go there are communities of Irish . ###Mhm . 
787473:91	###No that 's true . ###Cos I found out that the hard way . 
787479:87	###Absolutely right . ###And you ca n't leave . 
787485:9	###and playing you know . ###With people who 'd be have nothing to do with the music business or just you know it 's just the social er the social life you know . 
787546:13	###No and there was a gay fire eater , the lead singer was eating fire that night as well there was guys with these er fire hoses all round just in case . ###Yes yes . 
787564:46	###So you know our audience are are getting bigger from what we 're doing so it would n't make any sense to ###I also thinking about what we 're going to do is we would end up sounding like a Foster and Allen song anyway you know not deliberately but I think you know by the time we 'd have have by the time we do the way we 'd be able to do it it would sound like Foster and Allen . 
787572:38	###But then in seventy nine we had a hit at home with Bunch of Time and that as far as we were concerned was the end of the road you know to be successful in Ireland and then late eighty one , early eighty two you know they started playing Bunch of Time over here and it became a top twenty hit for us and that you know changed the whole thing round about and got us from say the pubs in Ireland into the concert circuit in England which we 've been doing ever since . ###I it 's a lovely record Bunch of Time is n't it ? 
787608:7	###And on November the twelfth that 's a week on Friday they 're at the Ritz at Lincoln in Consett . ###Right let 's have collector 's corner if you can help anyone on collector 's corner call please Nottingham three four three four three four . 
787776:26	###Look Sharon from Grantham is taking you on today . ###Mhm . 
787816:37	###They 're The Who and er A Pin Ball Wizard a car park queue wizard is er Annie Smith what 's happening ? ###The Walkden Street car park in Mansfield that 's got plenty of space . 
787829:25	###Calverton Colliery 's been put into the review procedure by British Coal . ###They say the pit 's lost more than six million pounds this year and it 's prospects are n't good because of a lack of markets . 
787839:14	###The men at Calverton will find out their fate tomorrow when a reconvened review meeting 's held . ###Ian Slater Calverton 's U D M branch delegate says the speed at which the meeting has been arranged is another attempt by British Coal to reduce the review period which could give the mine a nine month life line . 
787845:18	###Speaking of the funerals the former Bishop of Derry , Edward Daley appealed to politicians to treat what he described as this intolerable situation with the utmost urgency . ###Lucy Atherton reports . 
787846:8	###Lucy Atherton reports . ###Bishop Daley said we must appeal repeatedly to those faceless heartless murderers of all organizations and to all those who identify with them to stop their diabolical activities . 
787887:44	###On three occasions since nineteen seventy nine execution warrants have been served against Earl Pratt and Ivan Morgan . ###Each time they 've been reprieved at the last moment . 
787920:61	###On the trains British Rail say it 's all fine no problems East Midlands Airport it 's all fine there no delays to the services at the moment . ###Let 's listen for a space with Annie Smith . 
787932:128	###Tarrah . ###Bye . 
788153:15	###Yep . ###All right then . 
788218:9	###Well yes we would and you can hear Colin Slater beamed from Molyneaux tonight in a sports special . ###Also words from the former England cricket captain Graham Gooch , Nottinghamshire 's Jimmy Smith on basketball and of course the globe trotting and well tanned Martin Fisher from five past seven G M T . 
788295:92	###I forgot to ask are you busting out all over ? ###Oh yes . 
788524:9	###Bye bye er that 's that done , now we 'll do another one tomorrow . ###Now Nottinghamshire 's big bang , a week of pretty fireworks day two . 
788557:53	###It 's Dennis next Tuesday afternoon so it 's Where Are You Now on Afternoon Special , on the county 's favourite radio station , it 's B B C Radio Nottingham at two o' clock . ###Radio Nottingham news with Rob Thomlinson . 
788604:7	###On the hour the news and weather , and we 'd like to hear from you this afternoon cos we have a phone-in and you can take part and have a chat on the air . ###Simply ring us on Nottingham three four three four three four to have a chat . 
788703:10	###Good afternoon . ###Hello Dennis . 
788709:7	###But okay you 're going to be all right for the concert a week on Friday ? ###Well I hope so I sincerely hope so I think I shall be though . 
788717:29	###But it was a marvellous grounding was n't it Ted Heath ? ###Ah tremendous I mean it 's a wonderful apprenticeship I mean I do n't know where the guys go now young fellows 
788741:7	###Yeah . ###It 's just that the er , Southern Ireland due to T G I . 
788741:27	###Yeah . ###It 's just that the er , Southern Ireland due to T G I . 
788762:55	###Who did you send it to ? ###Divisional policy managers , Elizabeth and Richard . 
788767:125	###Agreed . ###You 'll never be able do , train people to design , whether a suggestion will or will not fit . 
788794:12	###Mmm , yes . ###You do n't need to unless you want to , include it . 
788821:39	###In fact , we clearly , we agree just an instruction to sample to . ###I do n't think I do agree there . 
788826:16	###So have we got to change . ###Well , there 's not much , there does n't seem to me to be much point in in having pink forms to go into pink files if there are pink forms that do n't go into pink files . 
788833:54	###There 's four wallets . ###you only want four wallets , if you 've lost four colours is that too drastic or not ? 
788834:12	###you only want four wallets , if you 've lost four colours is that too drastic or not ? ###No , there are probably other forms already existing on those colours , we presume we would have to take off those colours . 
788838:50	###No , if you think of it from the users point of view , not necessarily . ###Not necessarily . 
788840:33	###All I 'm saying is the forms that are mentioned in the procedure that have to go in those wallets ought to be in those colours , so red , so pink . ###We 've just gone on pink onto red . 
788936:12	###I do n't know whether this is necessary but Caroline erm , but when we take on a new type of business which is n't covered by our current procedures erm , say electronic data collection or something , which up until then has been done on paper , that we ought to have some simple statement in a procedure about how we are going to er , ma , ensure that we 've got a new set of procedures to deal with that new type of , new system . ###Can ? 
789010:38	###Do you want some fine ? . ###Any comments after reading ? 
789021:17	###It seems to be easier , as a procedure only you can take on all of this idea , but if your not clear about the detail bit . ###something to the research at the end of the delivery or whatever it is . 
789025:4	###Sometimes it takes a bit of a while to . ###This is why I do n't think it sensible to have a separate procedure for it , ' cos it 's so simple . 
789035:16	###When you or , when you order five hundred reafs of paper , do you get five hundred reeves and is it of the right quality from the sheets . ###Yeah , which is precisely what they 're doing in the order book . 
789054:34	###If you order one copy of a programme , you get a copy of the programme , you put it in the machine , if it works , it works , if it does n't . ###In this 
789064:48	###Although I have n't , well I have n't marked up anywhere that I 've got it . ###Erm , put into the that it was the right packet . 
789064:113	###Although I have n't , well I have n't marked up anywhere that I 've got it . ###Erm , put into the that it was the right packet . 
789074:38	###Very sensible . ###Well , I just ca n't see how your accounts would let you get away with not saying if it 's okay . 
789087:17	###That 's on your page . ###Yes , , I just said sub-contracting work is where you put something about size of the invoices . 
789101:9	###The signing of the actual invoice . ###invoice . 
789110:22	###Could I draw this one to a close by suggesting that the procedure owners , who own the procedures identified in the take on board the need to make a minor adjustment to set the principle in place and the . ###In your work on procedures nineteen and twenty you recorporate the sort of suggestion you 've had here that general purchases are checked and a record of their checking is the formal authorisation invoice . 
789114:37	###It 's where you draw the line as to when you need , and that I 'm not sure about . ###If you 're using ordinary photocopy paper for internals , stuff like that makes no difference at all . 
789173:14	###They were listed in your original list on fifteen . ###Right , and then in Q fourteen instructions are in capitals but not in bold . 
789225:9	###We 'll return to it when we get there in that case . ###So , the procedure owner is responsible but can delegate the responsibility for the physical possession of document to someone else . 
789309:27	###Some of them might be sixty year old , John . ###We 're booking the town hall 
789322:34	###Because it , in a job that ca n't be done in isolation , to complete this procedure or procedures , we may have been plural , needs er , consultation with er , certainly with Simon 's division in quite a substantial way . ###Erm . 
789456:59	###But I would still like your responsibility as division quality manager to make sure it gets done . ###There 's no escape , Simon . 
789456:75	###But I would still like your responsibility as division quality manager to make sure it gets done . ###There 's no escape , Simon . 
789462:122	###Something like that . ###I know that they are all non-standard . 
789462:144	###Something like that . ###I know that they are all non-standard . 
789462:190	###Something like that . ###I know that they are all non-standard . 
789478:10	###I think that if any one else could , because I do know that she has got an amazing amount of work on her plate at the moment ###But she 's still got to do the manual . 
789491:15	###Okay , great . ###the discussion . 
789492:24	###the discussion . ###However , we still have to do the other bit to go in the , yes . 
789492:77	###the discussion . ###However , we still have to do the other bit to go in the , yes . 
789515:18	###Erm , they have had internal discussion and I believe they are not going to do anything until they get a prompt from Jenny , ' cos that 's what they 're expecting . ###Now they do n't need it . 
789549:78	###I think mostly erm , I think that the audits have gone erm , very well actually erm , people are following the procedures and they are at times , they are a little bit slipping up erm , enquiries seem to be an area and filling in the enquiry form properly and making sure that it is copied to the divisional enquiry file erm , a few people fell down on that erm , but in most cases the procedures were followed virtually to a letter . ###There are only minor things erm , Chris suggested changes to the procedures , just tidying them up as we might have expected at this stage really erm . 
789597:51	###As in the original file the enquiry form has been copied . ###Back from February this year or something . 
789685:16	###People are supposed to fill in the job description on the first page of the appraisal form but do n't , in a lot of cases . ###Mean write it all out again , wonderful . . 
789694:39	###Right . ###Is this under the training as part of the general relevance to personnel issue . 
789720:17	###That 's what we are trying to do in that sub-committee which will meet for once perhaps and maybe twice . ###Not a standing committee of any kind . 
789722:37	###No , but you will have to consider ###But there is Company Standing Training Committee , which comprises people from divisions which looks at those issues , run by Jenny . 
789727:31	###Performance evaluation , yes . ###Again , currently there is no way , official way , of saying what plan has been made and whether the plan was met and then logging it into whatever system that you guys are going to dream up for recording what training you have given . 
789763:55	###I have n't taken into account the suggestion forms that I had this morning and some quiffs that I have n't had . ###Until I 
789799:209	###You 're being very autocratic . ###Sorry I am just trying . 
789801:7	###No I do n't think that 's , sorry , I think it is perfectly possible for Stella to make this assumption to get them changed and to come with the revised version which says , which is apparently what Jenny has done here , this looks to me , in a not unreasonable way , it looks , she is saying something is there , this must be an example of what Stella means , data can be stored in three different ways where clearly previously that said four different ways . ###So once crossed out that is perfectly reasonable , but I do n't think you should just say somebody is delegated to change the procedure and it happens . 
789802:57	###So once crossed out that is perfectly reasonable , but I do n't think you should just say somebody is delegated to change the procedure and it happens . ###We must do a formal vote as it were . 
789818:12	###something which is no longer in the procedure you 'd leave it in crossed out . ###Yes , so people know what has changed . 
789837:74	###I certainly know erm , reading quotes and audits and things and even just reading the procedures myself I 've made notes against certain things that . ###So , we should take on board when we look at Simon 's suggestions for Q P one , not only at things he 's but any other note that anyone else has got appropriate to that procedure . 
789840:64	###Is it possible that erm , this doc , this wad of stuff that you 've had ###Yeah . 
789934:22	###Now points eleven and twelve are just T G I so we 'll just plonk in what . ###It sounds like Jenny has tried to draft something there which applies to everyone . 
789969:101	###Yes , it could be the first sentence of ten . ###It could be the first sentence . 
789979:108	###Exactly . ###That 's divisional enquiry records , that 's just the enquiry form . . 
789983:54	###No . ###No , I agree with your John I mean it should be at the researcher 's discretion to dump it if necessary . 
789985:35	###What ca n't ca n't , do we really need this because it does n't say you have to throw it away after a year . ###Are we taking about the form on the related documents 
790023:47	###No the first , the job is not commissioned , that I copies the enquiry . ###You can do that . 
790024:12	###You can do that . ###Happily carrying on doing that it 's not going to be every enquiry has to do that . 
790030:59	###that 's why the archive ###Yes you could see it would be much more important to you . 
790061:7	###January , January . . ###Well it depends how many how many we can get together to issue at once , but I would like to have . 
790148:44	###Thanks a lot ###That was the one thing you warned us to be careful on , so that the benefit 
790175:18	###No you did n't good . ###Fourteen , A , a choice of investment plans , is that a benefit on Healthmaster ? 
790229:7	###Remember we said the other week there would be some questions that will be shared between the papers because they 're mandatory , and therefore pertains to talk about that particular product . ###Number three , what are the current premiums for a new Healthmaster policy ? 
790302:18	###I 'll want to stay at ###Because that 'll be for 
790395:14	###Yes . ###Very basic , c , c , How to run a business . 
790395:84	###Yes . ###Very basic , c , c , How to run a business . 
790411:12	###I 'll give you an example , I went to G-Mex to watch an exhibition , and we had some complimentary tickets to go , which means you 've got a special entrance for complimentary tickets holders . ###Yes ? 
790421:76	###We are like that are n't we ? ###Oh there 's a queue , let 's go and join it . 
790421:100	###We are like that are n't we ? ###Oh there 's a queue , let 's go and join it . 
790428:7	###Now you 're going to be self-employed . ###For those of you who think self-employed actually means well I can crawl out of bed at elevenish , work till fourish , that 's three days a week because the other two days I can have a couple of rounds of golf , Thursday and Friday , those of you who think that 's what self-employed means , are gonna fail . 
790430:9	###You have to earn the right from now on to have holidays , because when you 're on holiday , nobody 's going to be paying you . ###When you have a day off , nobody 's going to be paying you . 
790443:10	###Naturally , reasonably good planning , it 's just that you ha , you do n't realise it . ###What we 're going to do is have a look at the ingredients of a plan . 
790458:9	###Yes ? ###So let 's think about a plan . 
790458:29	###Yes ? ###So let 's think about a plan . 
790459:18	###So let 's think about a plan . ###Every plan must have a starting point , it must have an objective . 
790564:171	###I think , was it Colin I was talk , we were looking at a Porsche the other day , and he was drooling over this Porsche , and yet it does n't do anything for me . ###Are you with me ? 
790603:58	###And he 's , he took a photo ###Motorbike 
790730:22	###Is that fair comment ? ###You can always say if you disagree , it 's just a general comment . 
790738:37	###Settle for free would you . ###Would you like that ? 
790740:17	###Well you 're not going to get it , you 'll have to do it yourselves . ###Alright ? 
790784:39	###This is your bit . ###This is your bit . 
790867:7	###He ca n't if you put in , if he thinks everything 's rosy here , he ca n't help you , but in fact you 're going down the swanee , you 're only fooling yourselves . ###But it 'll tell you how many first appointments you 've had , how many fact finds you did , how many subsequent presentations , how many , how many sales you did in September ninety three , week , all the rest of it , and right at the bottom here it 's got the ratios , right , how many approaches to sales agreed . 
790966:253	###Mm . ###it was n't possible because there was a shortage of land and that how that absolute egalitarianism had shown that how that it could n't work if they wanted to raise everybody 's level towards a middle peasant status . 
790968:55	###They , they did have the option that they could have had complete absolute egalitarianism and made everybody into a poor peasant , but the commun but the commun the Communist Party were progressive and they s saw that how that you needed to have industrialization in order to increase the welfare of peasants which was their ultimate aim , and I mean it appears that how that they did n't actually care er what kinds of means they 'd have to achieve that , as in capitalism was justified in this longer term perspective . ###So do you , do you think erm this , this sort of movement towards the er cities and urban centres , this sort of gravity focus , do you think that indicated any sort of error sort of thing in , in land reforms ? 
790989:7	###Well I did n't think they could 've gone straight into socialization because they did n't have the resources to . ###Right . 
790990:12	###Right . ###They had to improve the productivity 
791018:43	###Well the Party was reaction of the sort of the peasants in the villages , if they we if they went straight for collectivization , straight er immediately after the peasants had received this wonderful gift of land in land reform ###Right . 
791057:41	###Now that might be wrong but i surely that was the reality of the time , that was the expectation , that was the whole idea that was coming over in terms of , of sort of propaganda and policy , whatever you want to , to call it . ###And if , if , I think there , there was a very deep belief within the that they wanted to own their own land . 
791059:102	###Now if , if you take those bits er would n't one have to argue that , that the move into capitalization was straight away ###Mm . 
791059:128	###Now if , if you take those bits er would n't one have to argue that , that the move into capitalization was straight away ###Mm . 
791069:13	###to , to having a collectivization policy an and moving forward so that immediately into socialism . ###Mm . 
791127:116	###and erm I imagine ###Yes . 
791128:85	###Yes . ###so erm investing into industry which I do n't know much about , and I , I am suspicious that invest into industry anyway erm so it 's gonna have , to work it 'll have to be quite a long term policy , well I imagine it would n't be a short-term policy . 
791179:17	###But I 've got to reassure you ? ###Certainly . 
791274:32	###So if this is our strategy , we 've clearly got to favour the rich peasant . ###Th th that we er we , we are moving a long way away from this egalitarian position , we 've abandoned that and we 've said right we , we are 
791612:62	###If you 've got inequalities and everything then you say ah yes , it 's all very good , we need this , the Marxist class struggle , I mean that just seems like a ridiculous argument to me . ###But w was it , was it the size of China that made this necessary ? 
791637:81	###sure , th th th that is your other option is , is that you go for a m a much more equal policy and the , the government takes money in taxation and puts it back into the , the agricultural sector . ###Right . 
791642:10	###Yes . ###that so , th that sort of policy would be very , would 've been difficult 
791658:46	###Mm . ###Yeah . 
791756:12	###the second year you increase about as much but the third year you 're gonna bring it right down use hardly anything at all . ###Yeah but the point is 
791771:105	###I do n't see ###Well presumably would go back in the village and if you asked other villagers look how much has X grown on that bit of land they will tell you . 
791803:7	###It does if ###we wanna keep them happy . 
791861:52	###I mean if , if your cut-off point is six or eight hundred say six or eight hundred yo you 're gonna , you know , you 're into a very large section of the population , if you will come to four hundred and fifty you are into a much , much smaller proportion . ###But you , you 're right that if we stick to somewhere between six hundred and seven hundred as , as a erm even a basic kind of subsistence I E you 've just got enough in just , you , you 're just not using enough food to get yourself up to two hundred , two thousand calories a day at that rate you were still being taxed on , a at a rate of almost twenty percent of your , of your income . 
791878:28	###wa was n't it when , when we were studying about landlord tenant relationships ###Yeah . 
791887:11	###payments . ###Th th th there 's all of that and there is obviously the , the option to borrow and there is the opportunity to work as , as hired labour or handicrafts etcetera . 
791900:29	###Yes . ###Right . 
791929:16	###I mean perhaps the forces of change that were normal were not inherent in the Chinese ###Yes . 
792005:14	###As you 've seen from the erm discussion paper that we submitted sir , it 's our feeling that the most helpful way to proceed might be to add a new policy to the alteration . ###Or alternatively adapt Policy I five to allow for a strategic erm site or sites to be brought forward by local planning authorities in the course of their local plan work . 
792012:114	###Now almost by definition it 's very very unlikely in this county that a site of that size development would be found within a built-up area . ###But size is the first criteria it seems to me that one should be looking at . 
792020:64	###Now that again suggests for this strategic type of inward investment a location away from existing built-up areas . ###On the one hand for environmental reasons , for their environmental reasons I should say , and on the other hand so as not to come as a nuisance to residents of existing communities . 
792021:18	###On the one hand for environmental reasons , for their environmental reasons I should say , and on the other hand so as not to come as a nuisance to residents of existing communities . ###Another safeguard that it seems to me that any such policy should have should be that development of the site must be possible without breaching reasonable and appropriate environmental standards . 
792032:59	###Criteria I 've su criteria I 've suggested narrows the geography pretty precisely but if you felt the need , the local authorities felt the need , for even further protection it does seem to me from my own experience of the Nottinghamshire precedent it is possible if if you felt so inclined and the county was to agree you could narrow it even further by naming one or two erm local authorities such a site erm should be discovered . ###Now that sets the general scene sir . 
792038:84	###I 've described some of the characteristics in those sites . ###Now this aspect of competition is inescapable . 
792072:32	###It may be you see that the manufacturing flavour of the past two years was to do with the pre er Common Market period getting inside the European Union ring fence with the manufacturing plant and there is speculation as to whether that will now change that the Common Market is now established and that that window of opportunity for manufacturing has tended to recede suggesting that it may be erm administrative er er services service sector that erm these international companies would now want inside the Union . ###We do n't know but I do n't know but that is a doubt as to whether the manufacturing flavour of the past will be carried on through the decade . 
792092:13	###Now whether we would find in our strate if we were to have a strategic sites policy erm whether there 's an issue there that it might let in as it were too much of that kind of land use and not enough of the manufacturing or proper office kind I think is worth kicking around the table . ###And if it is an issue as to whether there 's some way of containing that . 
792097:31	###On the number of jobs ? ###Well , if you 'll just , if I 'm allowed to turn round and consult the chap sitting behind me I can actually give you a direct a direct answer . 
792101:51	###I 've actually I 've actually been doing some arithmetic while you were talking ###Thank you . 
792117:42	###Erm against that there is this elephant which appears , and you say we might have it and find a zoo for it , and in fact we ca n't move fast enough to find the zoo . ###Now the the problem with the dealing with I I suspect with the major exceptions policy is that if you had it could you move fast enough in order to cope with that sort of animal appearing on your horizon which you wanted to capture . 
792148:130	###And in fact at the greenbelt plan inquiry er er I I spent a considerable amount of time arguing on the issue of prestige sites and the availability of prestige sites within the greater York area already planned and available . ###Er I think the county council recognizes the role of inward investment but that it is a small part of the ec economic growth . 
792160:72	###It 's it 's not necessarily possible to generate jobs from with within its own boundaries . ###I mean the focus of the plan and the way we 've approached erm trying to identify the appropriate level of of land takes into account all that we considered to be the needs of the local economy . 
792191:29	###And for a number of reasons we we felt that this was n't appropriate er primarily because it 's it 's an inflexible approach . ###Erm it is n't really tailored to meet the needs er of the sort of developments we 're talking about . 
792199:121	###The third option is to go for a strategic exceptions policy in the structure plan and obviously this is what er the borough considered considers is appropriate . ###We feel that this would provide a framework for the evaluation of the material considerations which the county council has accepted can come into play . 
792204:71	###Er in fact it is actually erm er re reproduced in my my evidence , paragraph four and five . ###Now that seems to us to be a very good way forward in establishing a framework for for the consideration of those sort of proposals . 
792233:17	###Erm secondly , it might reasonably be expected to demonstrate that it would be in the interests of either the region , regional or sub- regional economy . ###Then that thirdly , it it would need to help fulfil the economic objectives or the employment needs of the receiving authority which which I guess in in many respects boils down to nominating a particular authority or authorities if if you like . 
792257:129	###Er erm and I do n't think it had a planning history . ###The the erm situation for Lutterworth er Magna Park however I I am familiar with and it certainly preceded section fifty four A and erm in in there were two phases . 
792293:31	###Perhaps er my understanding was as as I guess Mr Saunders ' understanding of this policy was before Professor Lock mentioned Lutterworth , that it was primarily manufacturing or B one , B one or B two . ###This is this is now a now a terribly important issue . 
792298:110	###Yet . ###Erm what I was trying to do was be candid about what kind of er inquiries of the strategic kind might be expected to come if this county had that kind of policy . 
792299:20	###Erm what I was trying to do was be candid about what kind of er inquiries of the strategic kind might be expected to come if this county had that kind of policy . ###I think what I imagined erm Miss Whittaker and Chairman is that erm if you get the criteria right then this exceptions policy would also be an exception to I eleven , but it would have to pass this criteria . 
792299:44	###Erm what I was trying to do was be candid about what kind of er inquiries of the strategic kind might be expected to come if this county had that kind of policy . ###I think what I imagined erm Miss Whittaker and Chairman is that erm if you get the criteria right then this exceptions policy would also be an exception to I eleven , but it would have to pass this criteria . 
792330:52	###Patrick Earle Richmondshire . ###I also speak with a , a while ago now , but a certain amount of experience in Northumberland working for the county council in bringing development into Cramlington new town , so I am aware of the er the merits of er getting your elephants by having a cage already made . 
792358:113	###And what our colleagues in County Durham again in Northumberland we were able to do is was this was all in place . ###Here 's the planning permission here 's the site if you insist on going there well we ca n't give you any guarantees but we 'll do our best for you , but certainly the best thing is to have the allocation . 
792403:25	###Not necessarily as I five but as another fifty hectares as industrial or employment land whatever you 'd like to call it . ###David Allenby Harrogate Borough Council . 
792438:227	###How , picking up on the terms you use Professor Lock , how would the policy guarantee that what this elephant was special ? ###I anticipate that because that 's becoming now a key question . 
792460:12	###Thank you . ###Most developers would probably opt for the open site policy on the bas open site erm area on the basis this would better meet their functional needs . 
792585:18	###Chairman I think er I do n't think we 've got any any option but to say yes we we would . ###I think at er the sort of level of development and the location implications of er such a strategic exception , fifty hectares in some location which was totally outside the context of approved locational policy , this would represent a significant element of really nonconformity with the plan . 
792585:25	###Chairman I think er I do n't think we 've got any any option but to say yes we we would . ###I think at er the sort of level of development and the location implications of er such a strategic exception , fifty hectares in some location which was totally outside the context of approved locational policy , this would represent a significant element of really nonconformity with the plan . 
792598:99	###Erm we perceive no need at the present time for such an exception and the borough council seem to have accepted that . ###They see that their I five allocation is sufficient . 
792599:97	###They see that their I five allocation is sufficient . ###Er but we acknowledge that over time circumstances may change and that it may be appropriate and such circumstances erm needs may change different circumstances may arise and they would have to be dealt with within the strategic planning framework . 
792624:72	###In other words would the individual applications still be regarded as a departure from the development plan ? ###I I that has n't been made clear and erm you you then end up with getting down to the nitty gritty is this an application you advertise under the new procedures for ad advertising departures from the development plan ? 
792630:76	###Do you want to answer that one Mr Saunders ? ###I think the number of er er ex I think the fact that this is merely an exception a major exceptions policy that deals only with exceptional cases and the the Humberside structure plan refers to possibly once or twice over a planned period erm might er indicate it 's not intended to open to subvert section fifty four A . 
792667:99	###Erm all I can say is the county council economic development people are are there on the ground with their helicopters and the cameras when Kimberley Clarke comes in or the Central Science Laboratory and the car people and so on of the moment . ###Erm in planning terms I five , that 's where all these last two days string together , I five does not enable this kind of inward investment to come . 
792700:42	###Er the county council acknowledges that inward investment is important but because of the nature of the local economy and competition elsewhere , I think we realistically look at it in terms of er it going to provide a small contribution to the local economy . ###And that 's acknowledged by the Economic Development Officer . 
792718:85	###Er but certainly we are grateful for your participation erm some very good contributions . ###I 'm also particularly grateful for , and I said yesterday , to our two friends in the right hand corner here who 've er done some sterling work . 
792822:41	###Whereas really it 's only a few miles as the crow flies as it were . ###And it would be much quicker on a train . 
792894:10	###But I mean ###unless you 've got , yes , but unless you 've got excellent erm er transport services people will stick to their cars purely for the convenience . 
792994:10	###Has it ? ###Came down Halam Hill and went down School Lane . 
793037:26	###Did they not say that these buses did not pick up at Norwood Gardens did n't they ? ###They went direct . 
793037:129	###Did they not say that these buses did not pick up at Norwood Gardens did n't they ? ###They went direct . 
793205:7	###The sides of the road are giving way are n't they ? ###They are yes . 
793316:17	###Well no it 's just the stone . ###Well no no no no . 
793321:13	###Not on one of the new walls . ###Well it wo n't be on it 'll be in . 
793328:10	###Yeah . ###like that then it would be 
793536:10	###If we can take it back to about eighteen ninety ###I 've no idea this time . 
793703:65	###And you see now what the Government have said that they are going to accept that there are going to be two key authorities in some counties . ###Because their own backup 
793720:36	###We never ###it never ought to the exercise never ought to have gone out Harry . 
793891:23	###Why do we why ca n't we combine them with the parish council meeting ? ###Because we 've always done it that way . 
793893:12	###Well the annual parish we do have to have an annual parish meeting . ###That 's statute . 
793988:10	###no I 'm sure he did n't ###well rather 
794180:49	###On to tonight 's game , obviously you got one or two injuries going into it er unfortunate th Gary obviously i has got a recurrence of that hamstring strain because he got er two of your three goals at the weekend . ###Yes he seems to be getting caught Gary does whether it 's the pace of our game or the fact that he is n't fit enough yet , who knows ? 
794180:137	###On to tonight 's game , obviously you got one or two injuries going into it er unfortunate th Gary obviously i has got a recurrence of that hamstring strain because he got er two of your three goals at the weekend . ###Yes he seems to be getting caught Gary does whether it 's the pace of our game or the fact that he is n't fit enough yet , who knows ? 
794215:114	###And obviously longer term if you can get er a victory tonight then obviously it sets you up with a reasonably good chance of of going through from this group because two home wins , a couple of away games to go , and i it would set you up nicely . ###Yes I think a team that can go away and sneak a win will be the team that gets through in the end . 
794272:7	###Then there 's a little bit of friendly conversation ###A chat ? 
794381:11	###But basically , although Brescia , , and Pisa are in the same league as Notts County , how they er fare in the competition does n't really bother Notts County er as apart from their games against Notts . ###What I 'm trying to say is that er Notts County supporters have gotta watch out for the other English teams ' scores rather than the Italian teams ' scores . 
794396:56	###It 's it 's odd though to see David being so positive in the penalty area because he 's only ever scored four league goals you know ###he 's never scored in the cup . 
794420:11	###Throw-in by into the penalty area , heads it away , jumps again but too late , blows his whistle does the referee Keith and the applause tells you that they 're happy at , they should be , it 's one goal each . ###I think Shrewsbury have done very very well , they conceded a goal very early on in the game and they could have gone to pieces but they gathered themselves together , got back in the game with a goal from and they 've done themselves proud so far . 
794544:7	###If they concede another goal again now I think they could be in serious trouble again . ###It 's very unfortunate . 
794559:134	###takes over , Blackburn push it wide , at last has found some space but comes across to try and close him down , support just behind from , it 's a woeful cross from and it 's easily cleared by Shrewsbury Town right up to the centre circle , where it 's taken on the chest of Nicky . ###squares the ball to his left and Alan the left back just pushes it out wide to that far side but he loses out , competing successfully , he 's got going forward if he can find him , and gets it and lays it off to and can now run at Mickey once more . 
794563:7	###A good move again by Shrewsbury . ###Now Blackburn pushing forward , sets away inside the penalty area but who 's been so convincing in the Shrewsbury goal tonight and made some important contributions , makes another one there , so alert , racing off the line to get there before could get a snip . 
794582:52	###And he does so and he finds and squares the ball to his right , Alan made an advance for it but it 's was there first , put ball forward looking for and it 's just beyond the fair haired striker and races away to pick it up . ###What a shame just Mickey again out on the right hand side , Dean made a great diagonal run in behind the full back and the ball was just a little bit heavy otherwise there could 've been real danger again for Blackburn . 
794601:182	###Section two , there was a revised estimate for nineteen ninety two ninety three and there are two main points to mention , firstly members will see that the revised estimates in total are less than the original estimates and this is because affording interest rates have made it cheaper to service the outstanding debt from previous years ' capital programmes . ###Secondly the allowance for inflation was based on a three per cent price increase and because of the very competitive nature of the prices we receive for maintenance work a sum of two hundred and seventy thousand pounds can be carried forward into next year from this allowance , in other words the real purchasing power of the budget have been maintained and two hundred and seventy thousand pounds can be put aside to stand in the future . 
794603:113	###Paragraph three point seven describe in some detail with a figure of five hundred and fifty thousand pounds will become available in nine nineteen ninety three ninety four , when the rules change on the financing of structural maintenance on Principal Road , this sum would be enough to cover the two hundred and thirty thousand pound short that we mentioned previously has to cover the loan charges to sustain the same level of capital programme on schemes not aided by transport supplementary branch in nineteen ninety three four , as is currently being spent in this year . ###The use of this five hundred and fifty thousand pounds is conditional on the Policy Committee 's approval and the decision on this will be taken in January nineteen ninety three when the final standard spending assessment was known to the County Council , Chairman the recommendations I can claim reception for and the detailed budget claimants are attached to the pending here . 
794636:135	###Chairman I , I , I am and some of my colleagues a little confused on this paper , erm and I really ask that I , I understood that when we discussed this last , erm that the , the minor work which was one , one debated , erm was going to be increased to two million and that two million er , two million spend was going to come out of the existing budget , I 'm not quite sure from this whether it is or it is n't , could you explain ? ###The er , yes the er panel we , we discussed this and we , the appendix say , actually shows the current level of service being provided in ninety two three , which forms the minimum of the ceiling of the three point nine million . 
794666:12	###and it 's quite simple er at the government level to be a capital approval between those two headings ###Yeah 
794806:7	###Yes ###we are , we are referring to promise number thirteen in order to say you can on the thirteen , it 's the second page , third up from the bottom , we promise to repair potholes that are considered dangerous in the most important roads within twenty four hours of application . 
794831:26	###No , they are County Council lights , we could n't afford it if there was too many of them . ###Chairman with the , with the 
794831:167	###No , they are County Council lights , we could n't afford it if there was too many of them . ###Chairman with the , with the 
794945:61	###Would it be nec would it be a good idea to have Weeting 's Par Parish Council there as wel well , or representatives from there ? ###Well it 's those things that we would like to have decision making in these matters , and let 's face it Norfolk County Council or the Highway Authority and Breckland are the people of the 
794954:77	###I was gonna be happy to move the recommendation sir and anyone who 's aware of the traffic problem in London Road Brandon will , will support that and also sir the figures that in the questionnaire that was sent out support route A , emphatically because you 'll notice that double the people er double the number who returned the questionnaire supported route A as opposed to any of the other alternatives , so , so I think the , the recommendation that we were to accept this morning 's various adequately worded and , and accepted . ###I hope er the Chairman that the committee will not follow Mr ' s suggestion and will in fact support er erm Mr ' s alternative er suggestion er , as been stand at the moment to , to accept the recommendation on the order paper alone with the 
794966:90	###to accommodate else , yeah . ###Can we ask the surveyor than in fact to er ensure that that pedestrian crossing is shifted to accommodate er the local wishes , is that , is that okay ? 
794973:73	###County Council and the department transport strategy right now is to see the A one three four , north of Bury St Edmunds be made a trunk road and the ###situation I 'd suspect will be addressed within that other part , I did mention in my presentation that there are a number of inter-related problems here , I can trace about four or five , all of which have a chain reaction one upon the other , unfortunately Brandon is up front so we 've got to tackle it from the other direction . 
795021:59	###If it is to work effectively it will require the good will of Mr , who , in all discussion today has shown a most responsible attitude and I have no reason to believe that this will not continue . ###Chairman may I just read the conclusions of a letter from Miss , she says in my , it is my opinion that the local licensing scheme should be endorsed with a review after six months . 
795042:36	###Mr er yes ###Thank you Chairman , Chairman I think er sp Mrs in saying that all the villagers are affected by the 
795045:17	###and as you well know there has been a series of meetings in ###to try and immoderate the situation in 
795058:12	###Indeed . ###so now if I 've got to knock the surveyor 's heads together that 's 
795109:106	###I refrained from making any statement until I had the erm minutes which I received the er , agenda which I received the next day which contradict the abandonment , but if the idea was to sort of give this troublesome member from Bungay a heart attack , er it failed , cos I 'm still here and ticking , now I would like to go through once again the , the point regarding Bungay and I hope the committee will take it on board with . ###The traffic flow through Bungay had increased by thirty per cent over the past ten years . 
795126:126	###employ twelve hundred people , much of their traffic passes through Bungay , their products , their employee and supplies are all over the place and their products are distributed country-wide , much of their traffic goes through Bungay , and I think they both have plans to extend their plants both er Buxton and Bernard Matthews . ###Taking into account the length for the length of the features and the cons the consultation that take place and the length of time they take , I do not expect to see er Bungay bypass construction for some time yet , but I do expect the County Council to progress on that in such a manner that Bungay will not grind to a halt . 
795173:29	###the prime factor at present is to ensure that all land need for the schemes should protect against other developments and that flexibility is divided in ###construction of the A twelve 
795187:122	###Can we get our northern spine road finished ? ###Er can we get our eastern bypass finished ? 
795187:144	###Can we get our northern spine road finished ? ###Er can we get our eastern bypass finished ? 
795216:153	###Well in fact , in fact if you will see ###or some sort of reassurance for it 
795252:12	###Say it , say it again ###on the so called secret road , where , where 's the so called secret road go , it 's been in the Evening Star we have asked the , the Borough Council list and the Borough er the Council has asked erm for information of this road and they have n't even been replied to . 
795256:14	###Borough Council that ###er and as the 
795256:120	###Borough Council that ###er and as the 
795263:50	###have assessment the Vale 's Mr ? ###Chairman I have a copy of the environmental impact assessment report in respect of East Bank options , West End Road and Ipswich Northern bypass , they 've been on my desk from 
795336:186	###by actual figures ###Yeah will that satisfy them ? 
795355:8	###I will deal , I will deal with the action point that ###if in fact we are challenged upon the confide way of 
795372:60	###Just one , just one ###yes Mr 
795393:22	###Mr do you wanna speak sir ? ###Thank you very much Mr Chairman , erm yeah I 've put my hand up three or four times , but er bridges Mr Chairman I would like to emphasis on the bridges , it does n't the width of the bridges , yet bridges will be replaced 
795421:134	###Chairman we 've ###This town 
795432:58	###He did n't use it this time , I remember a number of years ago here in ###He re-introduces us to his perfect plan and purpose for us . 
795485:9	###He was n't just pontificating , he was n't just starting out things he thought about , he and and , ideas that had come into his head , he spoke as one who had authority and because of that they heard him . ###And he speaks to us today through his word with that same authority . 
795492:115	###Or what can I say ? ###What can I introduce into the conversation ? 
795647:187	###You shall be free indeed . ###Now , all these things are not just for this woman , they were for you , and they 're for me . 
795660:37	###He said but , why do that ? ###Why not have the well within you ? 
795679:150	###And then , finally , he talked with this woman , and he wants to talk with us because he wants to use us , he wanted to use her . ###And this how li , this is how God spreads the gospel , this is how he spreads his message through his people through using his pe , using in the very best sense of the word , he does n't make use of us he involves us in his work , and so , he saves us , he satisfies us and then he sends us forth , and he does that with this woman . 
795745:9	###Holy available . ###Let 's pause there and pray shall we ? 
795751:18	###And you have given your Holy Spirit to dwell within us . ###And you have given power over sin . 
795773:11	###Because , although Jesus was speaking to the people there , his words were not just for them , but they 're for us as well and these are conversations that we can well eavesdrop on and learn something , I 'm sure , for our benefit . ###Sometimes it will be , perhaps , I trust , new things that we 'll be learning or increasing our knowledge and our understanding of the Lord , sometimes underlining and reaffirming , er our faith in him . 
795775:140	###And so we must start off this morning with his , perhaps most famous of all interviews that Jesus had , the interview with Nicodemus there in John , er er chapter three part of which Elaine read for us earlier . ###This , the , the background I 'm sure we 're all very familiar with . 
795776:134	###This , the , the background I 'm sure we 're all very familiar with . ###This man , this religious leader , this pharisee who came to Jesus by night and as he comes to Jesus he , is full of questions , but Jesus does n't let him get too many of them out because the questions that Nicodemus has to ask are not the real issues . 
795784:61	###He says , we know that you 're a great teacher , you 've come from God otherwise you could n't do these things , and er , he was undoubtedly gonna go and ask , and start asking some questions from then , but Jesus comes straight in and he really deals with the issue , the real problem in Nicodemus 's life . ###He says , you 've gotta be born again . 
795786:9	###Do n't bother with the questions , let 's deal with the real heart issue , Nicodemus , you , have got to be born again . ###And you know , for most of our questions the answers lie within ourselves , and when we deal with certain basic issues most of those questions become or answered or they become irrelevant . 
795788:16	###It must have been about the turn of the century the er Times newspaper ran a competition and it wa , the competition was a very simple one , difficult to answer but it was very simply put it was asking for people to write in letters and essays , and features and articles on , what was wrong with the world . ###Now , you and I could sit down , as many people could then , eighty , ninety years ago and write a whole lot of things with the world , but it took the , the Irish writer and whip G K Chesterton to really put his finger on it . 
795796:70	###And what is wrong in my world ? ###As individuals . 
795798:12	###It 's not other people , it 's not the problems that surround us , it 's not the people that we have to work with or the conditions in work , it 's not the next door neighbours , terrible though they may be , the real answer , for you and for me , lies within ourselves . ###And that was what Jesus was showing to Nicodemus . 
795800:31	###Nicodemus , you have got to be born again . ###Now , we do n't know how long the interview went on , it 's quite likely we have only a snippet of the conversation . 
795836:15	###He does n't come with a lot pious platitudes and and charming words to make us feel better . ###But , he , he comes a , and really hits us hard ! 
795838:76	###Says , Nicodemus you have got to be born again ! ###But me ? 
795846:12	###I could tell you about some of their sins ! ###I 've heard about it . 
795847:7	###I 've heard about it . ###Nicodemus you , must be born again . 
795893:44	###You 'll find that his teach is in , is in realms above all other teaching ! ###His teaching of purity , i , it 's standard , it 's authority . 
795943:7	###That which is born of the spirit , is spirit . ###And in verse seven , do not mar what I say to you . 
796000:25	###Then again , Nicodemus discovered , that this new birth was absolutely imperative ! ###There was no , there was no choice , there was no option , there was no alternative . 
796004:10	###You ca n't kno , you know nothing about the Kingdom of God . ###We 're left in no doubt about the matter . 
796013:174	###You 're a full grown man , does n't matter how old you are , you might be an aged man , a teacher in Israel , he certainly was n't a youngster , you can , Nicodemus , be born again ! ###You see , it 's not er a natural thing , but it 's a spiritual thing . 
796020:82	###Now , the serpent of brass did n't heal them . ###What was to heal them was the act of obedience to what God had said , and faith in what he had said . 
796028:31	###Jesus said , I have n't got any other alternative to give to you Nicodemus . ###You 've come with your questions , you come with all the reasoning and your great intellect all your religious arguments . 
796031:205	###I 've got nothing else to offer you . ###I 've got nothing else to say to you . 
796042:7	###That does n't stand you in good stead . ###That has not got you into the Kingdom of God . 
796043:267	###That has not got you into the Kingdom of God . ###You must be born again ! 
796045:164	###We sang , a little earlier on , a song of er Wesley 's and back those two hundred and twenty , two hundred and thirty years ago , when Wesley was preaching in this country and in America , there was another preacher every bit as famous then , perhaps not quite so famous today , preacher by the name of George Whitfield and George Whitfield , he went around and he was preaching , and he preached on this , this text , John er , i in John three , you must be born again ! ###He preached them again , and again , and again ! 
796045:191	###We sang , a little earlier on , a song of er Wesley 's and back those two hundred and twenty , two hundred and thirty years ago , when Wesley was preaching in this country and in America , there was another preacher every bit as famous then , perhaps not quite so famous today , preacher by the name of George Whitfield and George Whitfield , he went around and he was preaching , and he preached on this , this text , John er , i in John three , you must be born again ! ###He preached them again , and again , and again ! 
796046:115	###He preached them again , and again , and again ! ###And there was a lady in the , in his congregation he preached to masses , to thousands and thousands of people , and she came to him , she was , she was annoyed , she was a rather er , well-to-do lady , and she was offended at this this preaching that she had to be born again , and that people had to have this new birth experience . 
796048:14	###And she came to Whitfield , and she said Mr Whitfield , why is it that you keep on preaching on this , and you keep on using this text , and keep on saying you must be born again ? ###And Whitfield said , madam 
796052:59	###We can change the terminology , we can give it different words , we can talk about making a commitment to Christ , we can talk about salvation , we can talk about conversion , the word , they 're not the important thing it 's this act of a new birth of receiving God in Christ for ourselves , believing that he died for us and are receiving this new life . ###And that was the lesson that Nicodemus learnt . 
796164:39	###But leave it with me . ###And the problem was very simple , there was a nearer kinsman . 
796176:37	###He 's gonna be involved in a lot of expenses . ###Redemption was not a cheap process . 
796179:85	###And so whilst Ruth and Naomi are resting and waiting back home Boaz is acting , and he sought out this man , he 's determined now to see that Ruth and Naomi receive all that is there 's by right . ###And so quickly he makes his way to the gate of the city as we 've said , and he gets this man he sits down with the te with the te , with the ten elders who would be witnesses and the kinsman arrives . 
796180:42	###And so quickly he makes his way to the gate of the city as we 've said , and he gets this man he sits down with the te with the te , with the ten elders who would be witnesses and the kinsman arrives . ###And it says in th , in , as you read through the record , as soon as he saw him he shouted with a shout that must have surprised the passers by , because , he hollered out to him he called out excitedly to him ! 
796205:61	###Whatever the reason he has neither the spiritual character nor the material resources to redeem Ruth . ###And it seems that in this whole area of redemption there are three qualifications necessary for redeemer . 
796207:19	###First , the right to redeem on the ground of relationship , a stranger could n't do it , it had to be a near kinsman . ###Second condition was , the willingness to redeem even to the point of sacrifice . 
796219:31	###We are redeemed not with silver and gold but with the precious blood of Christ . ###That 's the price of redemption . 
796360:7	###As I say , it was the time of harvest wi , the time of barley harvest when they arrived at Bethlehem . ###There as they come and look over the cities , small city , and they see the fields there around the city with the grain waving in the breeze ready and ripe just waiting to be harvested . 
796367:14	###And so , there 'd be the happy chatter of people as they were working , knowing there was gonna be enough and to spare . ###They would get through the winter without any problem . 
796367:42	###And so , there 'd be the happy chatter of people as they were working , knowing there was gonna be enough and to spare . ###They would get through the winter without any problem . 
796393:51	###But you know , the tragedy is that this does n't just happen when we 're non Christian , it ha can happen when we 're Christians as well . ###But oh , it 's it 's , it can never ever be God 's fault because he always , always deals with us in love . 
796404:52	###While we 're out of God 's will we cannot expect to experience God 's blessing . ###He would not be true to himself if he showered us with blessings while we 're outside of his will . 
796426:59	###Ruth and Naomi , they 'd lost all their possessions and the most prominent member of the family was a man called Boaz ###by skill and carefulness he had increased the family wealth and fortune and now he was a mighty man of wealth ! 
796428:15	###And before Ruth and Naomi could know anything of God 's provision , there was two steps they had to take . ###And you know , it does n't change , God still re makes a requirement of us . 
796429:7	###And you know , it does n't change , God still re makes a requirement of us . ###The first thing they had to do , and oh this is a difficult one ! 
796436:87	###But there was a way provided for them in God 's word . ###So you see ee God does n't leave things for chance , he does n't leave people on the scrap heap he reaches out to them all the time . 
796442:50	###And they were willing to humble themself . ###You know , the first step in getting God 's blessing is to humble ourselves . 
796446:25	###But it says humble yourself under the hand , under the mighty hand of God , then in that day he will lift you up , he will exult you ! ###And so to get God 's blessing there 's gotta be a , we 've gotta humble ourself . 
796450:7	###Now , harvesting is not easy , that 's a back breaking job ! ###But when you 've got a full field to harvest at least you 're getting something but when you 're just going around the edges and picking the bits that are left behind that is a hard job you 're spending as long but you 're not getting as much . 
796515:16	###The only thing was they were n't white to harvest , they were n't even ready , the crop had not fully grown , and yet Jesus says it 's white , all ready to harvest , what is he speaking of ? ###He 's speaking of this time now and this age when it is now harvest time . 
796540:61	###And so it was quite accidental that I started the club . ###It was something I wanted to do , but i I did n't know that until it started to happen , and then with the removal business too it 's more or less the same kind of thing . 
796545:38	###There was a thing called a B licence which allowed you to go within about twenty five miles with somebody else 's goods . ###So unless you 'd got an A licence you could n't be a removal man . 
796582:19	###But of course some of the jobs we do are quite strange really , and er er just as an example there were er th there was the job er when we were er moving stuff from the old school system . ###You remember they did the changeover five or six years ago now , and the schools were mi er were getting mix er er they were mixed sexes and they were Archbishop Holgate 's was going to be two sexes and so was Queen Anne 's . 
796584:13	###And at the swap over they had to swap equipment around for the reorganization . ###So we , on the small scale , for just bits and pieces , got m several jobs and one of them was moving stuff from the biology labs and the physics labs from Archbishop 's to take it all the way across town to go to Queen Anne 's school .

796599:78	###So that the whole thing does n't move . ###A good removal man very often can fill a van without ever using a tie once . 
796614:41	###Open the door of the wardrobe , put a wrapper over the big one , put it in the back , then sandwich another one , a picture in perhaps if you 've run out of things like that , till you get to the front , close the door , and you 've got it all packed away neat out of the way . ###And it 's always a good tip for a removal man to get rid of those things first . 
796616:16	###Cos if he gets rid of them first then he does n't have to worry about those things until er later which sometimes does happen . ###But all this is done so that it wo n't shift , it wo n't move . 
796621:60	###If you go to a house and you realize that it 's only a very small house and it 's a very big van you 'll only pack it up that way because you 're packing faster by doing it that way . ###Anyway I explain all this to give you a basic idea of the principle . 
796623:51	###But when we went to Arch the school at Archbishop 's the two lads that went , they had to pack all these various different acid carboys . ###They were alright , big glass things which you could surround and pack in tea chests with bits and pieces and equipment in . 
796654:9	###Well these were n't . ###They were very realistic were these , and there were fifty to be moved . 
796693:76	###Did n't you notice ? ###He 'd obviously had a bad night had this poor bloke , you know . 
796709:66	###So of course the poor Welshman with not having a sense of humour booked him , and poor Ben came back with a twenty-pound fine . ###Oh we 're alright then . 
796715:11	###So we went to the Yorkshire Museum there in the g in the gardens , Willy went along , and er one er and they wanted two men instead of one . ###They normally wanted one man to go and er and that was it . 
796717:21	###But two men had to go . ###And when we got there we found out why . 
796720:11	###It was a glass case with a tarantula spider in it . ###It was also another glass case . 
796731:25	###Course you can imagine how careful he was carrying it with that in it . ###And all they wanted it to do was to go around the corner to Marygate for the winter and then we s got the same in the spring to bring it back , but by that time the python was a lot bigger . 
796735:99	###But then of course the kind of stories I give and the ones that most people like generally speaking are the accidents I have . ###That 's what you 've come for most of you you see . 
796782:95	###Er y you do n't actually leave go of the cord straight away . ###If you do you need a joiner . 
796785:36	###But what you do as a removal man is you get hold of the cord that you 've pulled away from the side of the frame , put a knot in it , a loose knot , then leave go gently because again if you do n't leave go gently if it 's an old cord when it gets to the reaches the knot it 'll snap and you 'll still lose the weight inside . ###So you let go gently then you do the same on the other side , and then of course you 've got this piece free . 
796796:14	###So about four rungs down from the top I stop . ###I 'm quite well out from the ladder because it s at an angle and there in front of me is the wardrobe . 
796838:19	###And fortunately I suddenly had inspiration , just at the last possible moment . ###It very rarely happens to me . 
796847:17	###Honestly , cos I counted them when I was putting it together . ###We missed the lady fortunately cos it had you see that last push it just flew right over her head and past her . 
796855:35	###Some bright spark said By God I know what firm , I 'll write I know what firm to get anyway in future . ###No I funnily enough I just landed er er I I I did n't hurt myself at all . 
796862:72	###And it was bigger and it was shinier and er so she was happy a fortnight later anyway . ###But er there was one bit that did n't bust . 
796882:17	###We got rid of all the rubbish , put it in and started packing and erm about five minutes later the man from next door came out . ###And he said er Ee he says , they 're terrible houses these , you know . 
796885:44	###I said Aye they 're awkward are n't they . ###He says Aye terribly . 
796889:15	###I says , You should have been here five minutes ago , we did a marvellous job . ###We did n't get the job , incidentally . 
796916:14	###The man who owned the house was laughing at all this of course , cos it did look very funny apparently . ###But the problem was n't even helped there because you see he could n't get up the stairs easily , because the wardrobe was in the way . 
796955:24	###Oh they 're not moving . ###Ah . 
796961:18	###Get loads of it . ###It 's not for me . 
797028:48	###She 's spoiling me stories is n't she ? ###Yes . 
797066:54	###If it takes an hour and five minutes , we charge an hour and a quarter to get for the time to get back . ###And of course if you book over the phone , then it can be done that way . 
797144:34	###Now estimates are are actually that . ###You estimate that . 
797154:125	###No no she did n't tell us about the loft . ###Oh well would you like to go and have a look ? 
797157:11	###There was as much in the loft as there was on the whole first floor . ###My the boss said a few things under his breath , came down the steps and we went back into the van . 
797173:145	###Boxes . ###There was er there was the cooker er there was a cooker there was two fridges there was a disused ba er washing machine there was a And it all needed to go apparently . 
797189:20	###Was lumbered with the estimate . ###Was lumbered with the estimate . 
797385:17	###I says I I er no no messing around I want it back . ###Well I says I 'm very sorry but I says it 's six miles away in a store , we do n't attend stores in the evening , I 've nobody to come d I 've got Where the hell do you think I 'm going to sleep tonight ? 
797387:83	###I says Well I must admit it is yes I you know I He said I 'm going to get a policeman if you 're not careful . ###He says I want a poli I want my bloody b furniture back tonight , otherwise I 'm going to get a policeman . 
797408:10	###So I explained what had happened . ###He says Well you 're quite right n y I Cos I did n't think we You know I 'd said to the man already it 's quite possible I would n't be able to really take the stuff out of store for him . 
797414:62	###When you arrived at the house she was in residence . ###So you 'd made a verbal contract over the phone with a lady who you found living on the premises so you had every right to believe that she owned the furniture . 
797428:9	###Now I 'd also in this time rung up the er forwarding address in Manchester , rung up the telephone number I 'd been given of the forwarding address . ###Because she 'd paid the bill for the removal . 
797442:149	###I said Well I 'm sorry you 'd better refer to my solicitor who 's told me that you need a court order . ###And the trail went dead for about another fortnight , I did n't hear any more so , I thought Well maybe it is n't you see , maybe it is n't this chap 's furniture after all . 
797458:47	###And obviously I think it was a revenge job by the sound of it . ###And it took a year for him to get it back . 
797471:104	###Have you ever been threatened with anything ? ###Not quite , but these split jobs where you have a split between couples , it can get a little bit heavy at times . 
797471:130	###Have you ever been threatened with anything ? ###Not quite , but these split jobs where you have a split between couples , it can get a little bit heavy at times . 
797472:18	###Not quite , but these split jobs where you have a split between couples , it can get a little bit heavy at times . ###But my instructions for the lads have always been that if you go to a job for a lady particularly and then a man comes along and starts to get stroppy , you 'll have to explain to the lady you may have to leave it temporarily and go back . 
797495:15	###You know the kind , that lovely blar dark brown furniture . ###We arrived on this job , first floor , and we went and opened the door . 
797511:21	###Everything in the bloody catalogue at Ercol she 'd got . ###The only problem was that there was no space to walk ! 
797512:9	###The only problem was that there was no space to walk ! ###And in this last day , she must have been camping about , I do n't know how , but somehow she was traversing I she probably did n't she was using the living room as a store , I could only think that , she could n't possibly live in it . 
797534:10	###You know those little party dresses , what are they called , tutu dresses ? ###Mm . 
797536:14	###That five-year-olds have to go for parties . ###She 'd still got one of those in a plastic bag . 
797581:7	###We do n't use tea chests , incidentally , we use we wine boxes that we get from wine merchants , empty ones . ###Because people will put books into tea chests then you ca n't lift them . 
797644:24	###And when we get there , there 's probably four or five boxes to pack , but the rest is done , like books and crockery and things like th normal crockery . ###It can save immense time . 
797691:48	###get forty miles an hour down . ###Yes , yeah . 
797700:42	###Pool tables . ###We used to deliver them to various different places where they were rented out . 
797805:12	###As soon as you destroy the ninety degree angle you get a parallelogram do n't you ? ###Yeah . 
797935:17	###Now if you 're drawing fifty one point four , ###Mm . 
798003:13	###That sort of thing . ###Erm usually called a heptagon . 
798040:12	###Right . ###Okay . 
798087:7	###Four hundred and sev Eh ? ###You sure ? 
798260:36	###Mhm . ###Yeah . 
798262:10	###If you 're gonna draw that graph up what will you have to do ? ###put it down below . 
798265:29	###That 's right . ###Mm . 
798302:7	###It 's erm sixteen . ###It 's sixteen . 
798344:55	###Mm . ###I 'm the next one I 'm gonna do I 'm gonna spread it down below nought so we 're getting into the negative numbers . 
798391:62	###you know try and get Sometimes in an examination they 'll give you funny numbers like two point five but they tend to work ' em out for you . ###Mm . 
798544:16	###Right . ###Crime prevention covers a multitude of things er and we 'll bring it back to what actually effects you . 
798555:12	###But it 's knowing the right things . ###You can see lots of different security products on the market and . 
798592:47	###They 're very , very to open . ###They wo n't , the burglar is more likely to seriously damage the frame than the actual lock . 
798609:47	###Cos on the new P V C doors , most of the security is down one side , you 've got what I call multi-locking surface . ###Some of you , you might have seen them , where you 've got a number of bolts that shoot into the top from the side of the frame and the whole thing operates at the turn of a key . 
798637:9	###You cannot odds against the free newspapers coming through your doors , they 're a pain to all of us ! ###But we as crime prevention officers regularly meet with erm the newspaper people to say can you make sure your staff push them through the letter boxes and they assure us that the er , the next thing on their list to prioritize but it does n't happen . 
798653:34	###I , inadvertently ###went out of the house to go to , shut the door and realized I 'd left my cars in the house . 
798678:27	###So if I can just break it down . ###The best deterrent against house burglaries at the moment is an alarm system . 
798681:13	###Er if it 's at night time it annoys you , cos if all ring your neighbours they 're not gonna be so friendly if your alarm 's ringing forever and a day and you know , it 's disturbing your sleep . ###It 's important if you consider having an alarm you cultivate your neighbours . 
798681:48	###Er if it 's at night time it annoys you , cos if all ring your neighbours they 're not gonna be so friendly if your alarm 's ringing forever and a day and you know , it 's disturbing your sleep . ###It 's important if you consider having an alarm you cultivate your neighbours . 
798692:14	###It might cost you a thousand pounds if you live in a a huge detached house and in the back of building you 've got lots of rooms . ###But the average of hou , price for a house alarm ranging from about two hundred and seventy five pounds . 
798772:13	###Yeah . ###you want a police to come as soon as possible , and you want to , to deal with it because it 's a priority to you . 
798773:137	###you want a police to come as soon as possible , and you want to , to deal with it because it 's a priority to you . ###Now police forces have to grade their to to things , we get the immediate response , the nine nine nine calls , and then so on . 
798774:170	###Now police forces have to grade their to to things , we get the immediate response , the nine nine nine calls , and then so on . ###Where beat officers come into play is where you 've got the non-urgent , what we call , the traffic , the non-urgent jobs , erm , where people can afford , maybe a couple of hours , it might be that they have to wait until the beat officer gets on duty could be a day or so 's time and they they do do an awful lot of work , and it 's an ongoing thing . 
798784:42	###But I mean , we have got nine beat officers for the whole of the Harlow Town area and just th , this area this is the start of what we call our beat eight this is the boundary along Southern Way , and that goes down as far are familiar with the area of Staple Tye most of you ? ###It 's quite a distance . 
798793:10	###They reckon there 's supposed to be one allocated , but no one 's ever seen him . ###Why do n't you ask to speak to him ? 
798795:10	###We 'll have to . ###Mm . 
798824:21	###se , we never ever see a policeman . ###But that also is the case , I mean er er , a lot of time th the actual design of our houses does n't lend itself for us to actually look even if you 're you 're permanently looking out the window . 
798851:46	###And have you actually ? ###If you have n't , then , you ought to phone your local beat officer and get him to come along and give you a survey 
798869:31	###Yeah . ###Compiling reports and goodness knows what else ! 
798878:21	###that was meant as , as a bit sympathy if you like , you know th ###But erm yeah 
798892:17	###accept it . ###Well I , I , as I say , I did follow it up and in fact , I even went to a committee where I sat and spoke to the er the police face to face and they made all sorts of promises but nothing materialized . 
798916:53	###which , which goes to show that maybe the officer , er saying maybe , I 'm only throwing suggestions over there , cos I do n't know Shenfield ###Yeah . 
798916:65	###which , which goes to show that maybe the officer , er saying maybe , I 'm only throwing suggestions over there , cos I do n't know Shenfield ###Yeah . 
798949:9	###But there 's no one we can talk to , you know . ###Yeah . 
798950:7	###Yeah . ###Cos you must have a local of crime prevention officer . 
799017:18	###You see , on programmes like Crime Watch U K , where erm they 've got these Aladdin 's caves on all these stolen items that can never be returned to their owners , it 's very , very difficult to sort of mark silverware and things like that without devaluing it ? ###Ultra violet is one of the easiest ways . 
799019:13	###But with that , I have to stress , do not snap away merrily at all your valuables and then take your film into Boots or Supersnaps or whatever with all your details on it , because you do n't know who works there and who 's going to pick up that and . ###And just , . 
799083:20	###Trainers . ###White . 
799100:32	###they want it both sides of the coin do n't they ? ###you see the officer walking , walking around in pairs continually , not and if you 're gonna be paid extra for it , do it that way . 
799101:7	###you see the officer walking , walking around in pairs continually , not and if you 're gonna be paid extra for it , do it that way . ###If the police ca n't do it then somebody else has got to ! 
799139:20	###line to to be caught . ###Yeah . 
799140:71	###Yeah . ###And then , we then we have to trace . 
799268:70	###When you pick up the rec , the , the hands it will actually take you through to the nearest police control room area now , if it 's on the M eleven then most of the calls will go into Chelmsford , our police headquarters , once you cross over the borders and go into Metropolitan area , then that goes up to the Scotland Yard in their control rooms . ###Every telephone box has a unique telephone number , once you pick that up , it actually flashes a little signal , we can pinpoint exactly where you are . 
799273:75	###Yeah . ###Yeah . 
799278:52	###If you break down and you can drive to the nearest one , then do so , it i if it 's something like a , your wheel , or your tyre 's gone down , then drive . ###Yes , you 're gonna damage your wheel , but you 'll be safer that way . 
799279:14	###Yes , you 're gonna damage your wheel , but you 'll be safer that way . ###If you 've got no choice but to get out and walk then you are gonna have to do that , and that 's all very well being a day like today , where it 's not pouring down with rain er , you 're not walking in a pitch black area , but if you do suddenly change that and you put it into those sort of , well that sort of scenario you 'll find it 's very , very , frightening . 
799288:26	###And so we do try and give priority to , to ladies on their own . ###Given , obviously the fact that you 've broken , and if you are a member of a breakdown organization they will call them out for you . 
799520:14	###Oh I like ice cream . ###I 'm I 'm very partial to ice cream . 
799722:36	###Yeah I did n't realize how long ago it was till I 'd eaten that . ###but I forgot I had me T-shirt on . 
799961:12	###You live with three people . ###Compared to what ? 
800042:11	###Wednesday night . ###because she paid so much for it , over fifteen pounds right , because she paid so much for it because they 're usually fifteen pounds each and so two would cost you thirty pounds and because those were so expensive . 
800048:10	###Are you sure it was n't me . ###No it was n't you . 
800092:22	###Like that and then you just take it off . ###Oh right . 
800161:9	###Charles Bronson , , Donald Pleasance , Richard Attenborough , James Garner , James Coburn , David McCallum . ###Loads of people , it 's absolutely brilliant . 
800167:10	###you know when you have french ###yeah 
800202:59	###he did and he thought I grassed , but I never , geezer want your window smashed ###yeah 
800203:17	###yeah ###a red light come on the back and when , and then when the and let them go , must of heard it , saw running and he 's 
800220:110	###no it wo n't ###that will 
800327:32	###No but I get a message , will you tell my brother , no do n't tell my brother , they said , she said to one of the nurses and they said , your brother ? ###No , my son . 
800329:41	###I said well what did do n't you have to tell me ? ###She said , we 're not gonna tell you . 
800336:10	###Mostly dry , sunny spells ###Sally was quite intrigued by that 
800390:22	###What 're we going to do about these tiles for the step ? ###To cover this little hole up . 
800526:11	###It 's ten o' clock ###I know . 
800538:15	###Wish I knew what to do with the other azalea . ###Some of the erm stems on it look as if as if , not mouldy , but er they 're sort of 
800556:9	###Yes . ###Oh , it said in yesterday 's paper that someone had had a wheelbarrow valued at thirty pounds stolen from her back garden and it was somewhere at , where the back gardens are n't particularly accessible . 
800558:12	###So ours must have cost , I 'm sure that would cost them a lot more than thirty pounds cos it did n't it did n't say a wrought iron wheelbarrow or anything , it just said a wheelbarrow ###Well there was er four 
800581:12	###You have n't even watched the tape ###When have had an opportunity to watch the tape ? 
800592:10	###I thought we were walking ###Well , do you want to walk or do you want to go in the car ? 
800659:22	###I 've got the rest of it . ###I canna gi ' you one under there though 
800667:18	###Right , so I 've got the two pieces that are missing from my paper ###Well , I 've already paid for mine so I 'm going to get

801309:10	###Mm , go on . ###Let me think of one . 
801328:45	###Erm ###Final Fight . 
801491:18	###Something might go wrong . ###ca n't go wrong is that the th the thing in you put in the computer wo n't go off wo n't go off and wo n't be on the computing see what I 'm saying ? 
801611:7	###Oh , it 's at home , forgot it . ###see it

881783:9	###Nick has to come first . ###Come with us . 
881830:12	###Like it 's thi , they buy all that stuff , yeah , but if they 're stuff like , it costs about ten pounds or more ###Yeah . 
882002:21	###You 're a cunt ! ###Tt . 
882015:23	###It 's tomorrow . ###Oh it 's tomorrow . 
882077:43	###Yep . ###Well my Mum done it for me . 
882175:7	###We you okay mate ? ###I do n't think I was . 
882264:168	###This 'll crack my knees . ###Innit ? 
882268:30	###I wo n't be able to have my pizza . ###He goes , oh do n't be so silly , yeah ? 
882322:9	###Just go away ! ###Why are sitting right beside me on the phone ? 
882659:11	###Well Daniel 's a poof though is n't he ? ###Alright Jess . 
882783:12	###It 's perhaps being talked of rather jocularly that erm the supermarket will be able to present the latest price list on the screen , but that really is quite possible , it could almost happen almost happen overnight . ###It does require , however , a certain amount of erm investment .

882791:18	###We have n't even got a system , as far as I understand it , that 's compatible , so that it 's possible for me to send my reading lists to , for instance , so they can be picked up by the library . ###And that is just in one institution . 
882816:26	###Other things people will reject . ###I remember a very difficult erm problem I had when I erm was ordering some goods from a mail order firm and I kept on getting letters back after replies to mine , from the computer , and these letters were totally unconnected with my letter and I found this very very frustrating . 
882886:23	###Ask anyone with a washing machine . ###It 's an electro-mechanical device , with contacts and so on that tend to corrode and all the rest of it , and that sort of thing can be very conveniently replaced by a small microcomputer . 
882900:49	###Honda have just recently produced a motorbike that erm is microcomputer controlled . ###There 's also things like head up displays for cars . 
882973:7	###I think people in the British churches , and probably outside them , twenty or thirty years ago lived in a rather secure world and they understood that God was on the whole on the side of the British Empire and the missionaries as they went out to civilize other places , and that was true also of the other European forms of God . ###These days , as John has said , it 's much more broken down than that . 
882974:175	###These days , as John has said , it 's much more broken down than that . ###We have to come to terms with the fact that people 's experience of God differs enormously and the way they talk about God differs enormously , and in order for us to understand even what we mean we 've got to listen to them .

882995:214	###People used to fight each other over religion . ###Does this happen in any sense these days , do you think , or is religion supsuned by politics and economics and other facts of life ? 
883057:7	###did n't believe in educational psychologists , inverted commas . ###mhm Yes . 
883062:88	###One of the problems is at this very stage that the act is so new off the statute book that authorities , at the moment , under all the other pressures they 're having to meet , are only just beginning to put together their new policies . ###Some are further ahead than others , but what will probably be expected of most authorities is some sort of erm perhaps a handbook or certainly some advice to parents about the implications of the new Act . 
883068:67	###They also have a right to ask for an interview , usually with an educational psychologist who is , in most cases , responsible for advising the local Education Authority advisors on special education about particular children . ###erm not only that , but erm whereas in the past it 's tended to be at the prerogative of the education people , as it were , the teachers and the heads and the educational psychologists , to make the initial moves in categorization or making a statement , now the parents have a right to ask for an assessment , so perhaps in your case to your question it would have been yes , you could have in fact have erm initiated the moves . 
883085:150	###I mean this has been a debating point in special education for a long time . ###It is whether children with special needs should attend a special school , and of course the argument from this point of view is that a special school can have staff specially trained to deal with that kind of child , the sort of resources that they need , the protective environment that 's necessary for certain disabilities , and of course there are many special schools around - we 've got one here in Brighton for the deaf , for instance - there are a number of examples that one can point to . 
883094:249	###And finally , and this is something of a nebulous point , taking into account the most efficient use of resources . ###So what you really have from the government is a set of guidelines , and it will now be up to each Local Education Authority to interpret those guidelines and to make their own provision . 
883099:24	###and it 's not clear how it 's going to be implemented ###mhm 
883120:84	###erm I think the housing market is one thing . ###I think that the services that go with it are quite another . 
883151:27	###Since Mao they 've definitely taken the view that they should stabilize their population numbers as soon as possible , and they now have the most restrictive policies in relation to families , deferral of marriage , penalties for those couples that in the towns have more than one child erm and this is leading to a dramatic reduction in crude birthrate . ###But of course the children that were born yesterday , fifteen years ago , are already there as the parents for tomorrow , so their population will continue to grow in very large numbers , but will begin to tail off .

883204:204	###The birthrates of Liverpool , with its big Catholic tradition , are much closer to those of the South East than they were twenty years ago . ###erm the second factor , of course , is migration , and we know that there are lot of people still moving away from areas of relative decline , they 're moving into the countryside , parts of Wales , Scotland . 
883238:60	###What do you do , for example , with the situation in Hove , where the houses are built for one kind of clientele - big houses , servants - divide them up into flats ? ###Do they go to the people that need them , or the people that can afford to pay Hove prices that come down from London ? 
883259:91	###There was a peak of deaths , which you can see quite clearly , which occurred during this period . ###They would be dead today and they are walking around . 
883270:28	###In this controlled clinical trial , presumably it is important to test drugs on patients themselves and presumably the important feature , as you mentioned , is that they are volunteers , rather than people who are buying it , the medicines , in good faith with the expectation they 've already been tested ? ###That 's right . 
883271:10	###That 's right . ###Nowadays if you 're testing a medicine you have to tell the patient . 
883308:17	###One comes from perhaps the pharmaceutical and the medical profession side , and it seems to me the other side is really the public side . ###So many of us keep so many medicines on our shelves for donkeys years in the hope that we might find a pill that will suit us at some time . 
883344:94	###That information is only part of the very large store of information that we need to retain in our own local computer , which contains records about erm it 's about a hundred and fifty thousand of our four hundred and fifty thousand different books at this moment . ###Going back on what I said earlier on , East Sussex County Library , for example , keep their records of books , their catalogue , on a system which is run from the British Library and the Polytechnic draws that sort of information from a co-operative , which was originally based in Birmingham . 
883351:8	###The book is lent , it needs to be know when it 's gone out , when it 's due back , but the computer clock up one - that bit of information adds to other bits of information , all within the central store . ###We know what the price of the book was . 
883351:32	###The book is lent , it needs to be know when it 's gone out , when it 's due back , but the computer clock up one - that bit of information adds to other bits of information , all within the central store . ###We know what the price of the book was . 
883365:193	###That 's a very complicated question . ###And you mentioned , then , how a floppy disk - that 's a sort of disk storage device - can be used to get a book printed , is this being used at all in practice , or is it just a daydream ? 
883413:109	###I do n't think our contact is halfway strong enough , but the proposal to handle that is something that we we 're working on a the moment . ###Bob Gunnell , of course , is an was and has been for some time a very supportive member of South East Arts and active in many of its committees . 
883433:96	###Do you have any further thoughts on that ? ###Well , we 've talked ourselves about the consequences about of that role on the catering operation which is available . 
883435:15	###It 's marvellous that the Brighton Corporation came in , but nevertheless the building to perform a function which is going to be useful for the community as a whole has got to be properly funded . ###I think many of us would sympathise with that view . 
883457:184	###Do you have similar contacts with them ? ###Yes , each of them is well represented in terms of erm members of the University showing an interest in the arts work in their area , and several of them have members erm who serve on our advisory panel , as indeed Sussex does . 
883464:115	###I 'm very well aware that the director before me built a very stable platform on which we can operate , and that we 're lucky to have a region that 's so rich in talent , erm in artistic talent , and in enthusiasm . ###erm I 'm very much aware that the challenges are ahead of us , both in terms of erm dealing with a difficult financial situation , which has been the pattern now for three or four years , but also in entering certain fields and approaches to arts activity that perhaps require more of the central staff than previously . 
883471:18	###A couple of years ago I had a fascinating conversation with Professor Max Clues on just this subject . ###Max was Professor of Artificial Intelligence in the university , but sadly , since the recording was made , has died . 
883487:62	###Well that 's very impressive and encouraging obviously to any housewives who may be listening . ###But it seems to me this is an absolute revolution . 
883518:208	###What 's happened is , of course , that as the costs have fallen and the micros have come in through the door so they 're very much smaller , erm it all becomes possible for the whole of society and not for a tiny elite . ###Well at the moment that 's true . 
883595:36	###So that at the end of the day one has a much more rounded individual with of course specific talents . ###I 'm not for holding back children . 
883602:172	###How do you feel about parents teaching children how to read ? ###I think it comes to the same thing . 
883613:134	###Certainly , the most of the infant teachers I know take great pains to make sure that it is not traumatic and that the move from home to school is as easy as possible . ###Now having said that , often the trauma , which goes back to my original remark , is the sheer number of children , the sort of social impact that a reception class can have . 
883614:15	###Now having said that , often the trauma , which goes back to my original remark , is the sheer number of children , the sort of social impact that a reception class can have . ###Now if a parent can have introduced the child via nursery school to that amount of other children , then I think there should be very little trauma , but that is n't to say that as the child gets older they do n't have to do things . 
883614:109	###Now having said that , often the trauma , which goes back to my original remark , is the sheer number of children , the sort of social impact that a reception class can have . ###Now if a parent can have introduced the child via nursery school to that amount of other children , then I think there should be very little trauma , but that is n't to say that as the child gets older they do n't have to do things .

883616:108	###But if a child has to do something because they can understand the end a which they 're aiming , in the way that a footballer has to train , or a boxer has to train , then it becomes easier to do the equivalent of training . ###One of the difficulties is that the end state is so far removed from the average child that it is very difficult for them to see why they have to learn to read , but if they can realize that if they learn to read in those houses where they have it they 'll be able to read the Radio Times and know what the television programmes are , that at least is motivating . 
883642:67	###As you well know , there are certain basic rules which govern both subjects . ###To understand chemistry at all you 've got to have some idea of optics , for example , because you 're actually looking at the reactions happening and you 've got to appreciate what you see . 
883682:63	###And would , in fact , hydrogen have any advantages over conventional hydrocarbons as a fuel ? ###The advantage of changing to hydrogen would be an economic advantage . 
883727:7	###Yes , of course , that 's a very startling example of a drug which was n't properly checked through before it was used on a mass basis . ###Do you see any future in more careful controls on drugs , particularly drugs used to cure human ailments ? 
883730:25	###What about experiments on humans ? ###Do you think these are allowable , as it were , from a moral point of view ? 
883751:30	###It all boils down to interfaces , and I think that it is one of the more difficult areas of chemistry to work in and there 's a lot of room for advancement there . ###Lastly , is chemistry a good subject for a school child to think of going into ? 
883783:73	###Well by now it 's perfectly clear that the suggestion that these characteristics rest in the blood and in race is wrong , but there remains this enormous field of characteristic garnered from a long historical process . ###The British have been alone on their island for over a thousand years , without successful invasion . 
883840:90	###Why should people gamble if they 're bound to lose ? ###Ideas in Action Programmes , Side A , Can you win at Gambling ? 
883925:35	###You may remember that Samson was a man of enormous strength and then , following a liaison with Delila and her cutting off his hair , he was reported to have become as weak as a child - and yet there was an occasion , which led to his death , when he brought the whole temple down by pulling the pillars against which he was propped . ###Now that kind of burst of strength would just be feasible for a miocenic . 
883976:40	###It 's certainly true that the methods of treatment that we use in miocenia gravis at the moment are not specific . ###In other words , although they suppress the aberrant antibody , they suppress other antibody production too and also the production of blood cells , yet they seem to have a greater effect on the abnormal antibody than they do on normal ones and in quite large numbers of patients that have been treated in this way the side effects are really relatively slight . 
883993:30	###That still makes a good thirty years . ###How do you decide about a subject . 
884019:116	###I could do that to order ; that would n't be something I would dream of publishing . ###It would be highly unlikely that it would turn out to be very interesting . 
884020:46	###It would be highly unlikely that it would turn out to be very interesting . ###I mean when I wrote this book of bible poems in fact it took me a very long time and I started all sorts of subjects which I did n't finish , so , no , you have to be obedient to whether the poem intends to get written or not . 
884020:65	###It would be highly unlikely that it would turn out to be very interesting . ###I mean when I wrote this book of bible poems in fact it took me a very long time and I started all sorts of subjects which I did n't finish , so , no , you have to be obedient to whether the poem intends to get written or not .

884068:19	###I would hope , obviously , that I wrote poems that could sometimes speak to the reader 's condition , and it would be too grandiose to say helped him to sort out his own feelings , but at least helped him to get a feeling of recognition and , if the poem is successful , you know , some kind of satisfaction that the feeling has been turned into that permanent form . ###I suppose there 's a sense in which poetry can only be shared with other people if there is some common experience , maybe at a deeper level some collective unconscious , otherwise I would n't be able to respond to your poetry ? 
884070:205	###Well you do n't necessarily have to bring the collective unconscious , do you ? ###I mean most people 's poems are on widespread human experiences . 
884116:116	###And Gibbons ' Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire is again a great historical work , very wide-ranging . ###The footnotes by themselves are worthwhile reading . 
884128:36	###In other words , there are different interpretations of almost everything that matters in history , but what I wanted to try to do in that social history was to give some account of England 's past which was meaningful to people living in the late erm twentieth century , not for professional historians so much as for people who really did want to have a version of England 's past which makes some sort of sense now . ###And we 're always revising that picture of the past . 
884143:79	###There are different scenarios , to use the term that science fiction writers and futurologists use . ###The different scenarios are there in the past just as they are in the future , and it 's the historian 's job , in a way , to explain why there are different scenarios and to give some idea of how many of them there are . 
884168:28	###There 's every erm every one of us lives in culture or sub-culture which criticises our own evaluations and , as I said , if you belong to a motor cycle gang and you do n't like motor cycles you wo n't last very long . ###Either you get out or you 'd be pushed out . 
884168:50	###There 's every erm every one of us lives in culture or sub-culture which criticises our own evaluations and , as I said , if you belong to a motor cycle gang and you do n't like motor cycles you wo n't last very long . ###Either you get out or you 'd be pushed out .

884236:17	###Yet learning is the only way that things get better . ###This is my view , you see . 
884238:24	###It is that you have to learn how to get rich and how to get peaceful and how to be , you know , how to have a good life ###How to be happy ? 
884246:62	###I mean they do n't they just make everybody worse off . ###How do you develop what we call positive sum games , in theory , things which make everybody better off . 
884284:64	###So all the technical stuff 's going on inside the machine , and the user is spared the problems of knowing how to work it . ###Perhaps only three or four keys on the typewriter keyboard that the computer will have need to be pressed at all , and if a child presses the wrong one it does n't all stop and funny , you know , impersonal messages come up on the screen saying he 's done something wrong , it just ignores them and waits for one of the correct responses . 
884318:44	###So I think they 're right to be suspicious , and it 's right for those people who feel they have a role it 's up to them to make it appear interesting and to show them the relevance . ###It 's not the answer to all education 's problems , of course . 
884361:7	###Ideas in Action . ###Polytechnic programme on learning difficulties . 
884376:24	###How do teachers learn to distinguish between behaviour problems associated with learning difficulties and behaviour problems linked to a different set of disorders ? ###Well , teachers can use school facilities to eliminate the possibility that a child has sight or hearing defects , or other physical or mental problems . 
884377:26	###Well , teachers can use school facilities to eliminate the possibility that a child has sight or hearing defects , or other physical or mental problems . ###Then , says Bob Brooks , teachers must observe the quality of the child 's classroom response . 
884388:146	###Distinguishing between behaviour problems and learning difficulties is finally a matter of emphasis . ###Rod Smart . 
884389:81	###Rod Smart . ###I think you might find a situation quite clearly where you would find a child behaving in such a way in the classroom that it was being disruptive to himself , disruptive to teachers , disruptive to , to his classmates , and therefore the , the first move must be in a direction of rearranging that behaviour so that there could develop a situation in which you might do something about the learning difficulty . 
884406:42	###I think the only response you can make to any child who 's facing a challenge is that you care , that you will be patient , that you will go on and on and on . ###So often teachers and parents set limits . 
884408:20	###If nothing happens by such and such a time , then we shall have to do something else . ###They very often do n't know what the something else is going to be , but we tend to put time limits on what children should do and when they should do it . 
884408:39	###If nothing happens by such and such a time , then we shall have to do something else . ###They very often do n't know what the something else is going to be , but we tend to put time limits on what children should do and when they should do it . 
884458:18	###Even the methods of getting information in and out of a computer have changed beyond recognition . ###The reels of punch-paper tape and the boxes of cards are often replaced by ordinary cassette tapes . 
884464:29	###When computers , as we understand them in a modern sense , first came into use in the early nineteen-fifties , they were huge , expensive and unreliable . ###The basic circuits used electronic valves , and the heat generated was itself a great problem . 
884469:43	###They needed their own buildings . ###All computers operate on a very simple and fundamental principle . 
884473:19	###In principle this may appear to be a very cumbersome activity , but in practice it 's not . ###Because you can use a particular sort of algebra , based on the so-called binary system , which greatly shortens and simplifies problems , which might at first sight seem terribly long and complicated . 
884473:63	###In principle this may appear to be a very cumbersome activity , but in practice it 's not . ###Because you can use a particular sort of algebra , based on the so-called binary system , which greatly shortens and simplifies problems , which might at first sight seem terribly long and complicated . 
884474:9	###Because you can use a particular sort of algebra , based on the so-called binary system , which greatly shortens and simplifies problems , which might at first sight seem terribly long and complicated . ###The early computer programmer and user had to learn to speak the language of the computer , machine code , and had to learn how to put these simple instructions , often in very tedious forms , into the computer . 
884512:15	###I 'm not quite sure how many we 've got in Britain . ###But if we take a guess that there are thirty thousand , this means that in nineteen-ninety , three million people , or something like a tenth of the entire working population , will be engaged in writing materials for computers . 
884549:35	###And how much experience is , do operators need to work one of these things ? ###An ordinary little firm that has operated perfectly cheerfully with a clerk and a few assistants over the years , is it actually a practical proposition to install the computer and perhaps train one or two of the workers to use it ? 
884565:12	###Well I think gentlemen on tall stools with quill pens are becoming increasingly hard to find , and to pay a living wage to . ###erm And a lot of the time this gentleman would have been sorting through the data , finding out who owed how much money , writing them polite letters , and this is the sort of thing you can do very quickly with a computer .

884570:100	###What about erm order processing and so on ? ###Does that have an advantage to put on computer ? 
884571:34	###Does that have an advantage to put on computer ? ###Well , this is a slightly more complicated application , where you 're not just selling for example straight from stock , but you take orders from customers , and then you would have to manufacture , perhaps to buy in , to assemble , some sort of goods for sending out . 
884584:10	###Delia , you yourself run an advisory service . ###What sort of general advice would you offer people who wanted to check out the possibility of using a computer in their own operation ? 
884587:23	###And that really means which operations , in your own business , are taking quite a lot of time , and therefore costing you money . ###And the sort of operations of course that are capable of being put on a computer . 
884589:137	###So that first of all we would have to look at how much time people spend preparing invoices , sending out statements , producing age debtors lists and that sort of thing . ###Quite often people do n't need a computer , what they need is a slightly different manual system , and I tell them that quite often , they 're very , very pleased , they think they 've saved themselves two or three thousand pounds at least . 
884593:44	###Having decided on that general application , then it 's a question of shopping around amongst all the different computers that are on the market , and there are hundreds , to find the ones where the ready-made programs most nearly match the needs of that particular business . ###It really is n't these days just the hardware , the , the box of electronic magic tricks that matter . 
884608:9	###Yes , it can be a problem . ###You certainly do n't want your computer grinding to a halt in the middle of your important statement run . 
884622:19	###That 's all that we have time for today . ###Next week , Erin Sloman will be back again , talking about ways of teaching people computing . 
884658:15	###That is still to some extent , erm though less true , I daresay , than it once was , but the mystique , I think , survives , does it not , Anne will tell us , in Whitehall , that these people bring erm who , who are essentially amateurs in matters of political science , sociology , international relations and diplomacy , bring a gentleman amateur 's omnicompetent wisdom . ###Certainly there 's a very strong feeling that common sense is not something erm that can be trained by a training in political science and that it 's valuable . 
884674:98	###But some of the comparisons we can do produce quite interesting facts . ###erm The proportion of the total economic activity of the country , the G D P that is spent on social security and health care , is much higher in West Germany and in France than in Britain . 
884683:68	###That if our health service and social security system has got any special advantages erm left , which it may still have , erm then perhaps erm our friends in the Community could learn a bit from them . ###It sounds as if we could learn a great deal from Germany and Holland about , in the health service , erm because their systems by now by all statistical tests of mortality and illness and so on , seem to be doing a better job than ours . 
884686:27	###It is a question of priorities and what people , you think it 's worth paying for . ###And the Germans for example are at the moment very concerned , and indeed the French too , very concerned to try and keep costs down , because they have been erm going too fast . 
884703:104	###There was a red light up , and he was stopped by a policeman as he reached the opposite pavement and duly asked for the appropriate number of marks . ###erm I sometimes feel erm that erm in fact = it would be a good idea when I see people doing things which I regard as immediately dangerous , but I think it might make considerable difficulties for the relationship between the police and the motoring public which erm are already at times very strained , and I 'm not sure , for some of the reasons erm that Norbert has suggested , that it 's erm necessarily a very erm happy system . 
884713:55	###I can see that erm to introduce into this country on-the-spot fining , such as is known in some Continental countries , erm might sour relations in an unfortunate way between the executors of the law and the victims . ###What would be more satisfactory would be the introduction of the American towaway system , in which great lorries with grabs and hooks come round , and without any ado whatever , whoosh the car away from where it is illegally and improperly parked . 
884727:118	###Secondly , erm we have a change from erm a so-called conservative president to a , a so-called socialist one . ###erm He 's limited in lots of ways . 
884739:113	###erm Monsieur Mitterand 's relationship with erm Chancellor Schmidt for example is certainly not yet anything like as close erm as Chancellor Schmidt 's relationship with ex-President Giscard was , but they are both socialists , erm they do have a certain amount in common , and I see no reason why they should n't quite quickly build another erm relationship erm that would be quite similar to what happened before . ###On certain specific issues there may be changes of emphasis . 
884742:141	###But those are very minor matters , and in the long term , I think , as Geoffrey has said , erm the changes will not be very large or very important . ###Why do we always argue about fishing rights and seem to have very little argument about oil ? 
884779:104	###There is no reason why computers should n't be natural and friendly , it 's just that it takes a lot more memory in the computer to have all the complex rules of an ordinary language , and also it 's much harder to write the programs that tell the computer how to understand a natural language . ###On the whole , people use language in a , in a rather sloppy form , it 's ambiguous , they , they know what they mean , other people know what they mean but they put in all sorts of inferences by the way in which it 's phrased or erm the way in which the words string together or past experience of the person .

884783:50	###It means that , depending on the context , I can communicate something subtly different from what I intended before without us first having to go through the rigmarole of defining new terminology to extend the language . ###And this depends on our having very powerful and general rules in our minds for relating what is said to the broader context . 
884800:34	###It is a more powerful language . ###It 's easier to express complex ideas in PASCAL . 
884809:38	###We 've attempted to design a system which is friendly in that it takes account of the different needs that a person will have at different times while trying to communicate with a computer . ###Well these are just some of the ways in which computers can be made more friendly . 
884818:154	###Things are moving and I 'm hopeful that these problems will be solved . ###I 've just been up to the Wembley exhibition of word processor , and one of the things I noticed there was the increasing number of processors and packages which I think you would describe as friendly or at least semi-friendly to , to help people . 
884822:7	###People often , in communicating with one another , say something slightly different from what they intended to say , and the other person will make allowances , using the context . ###And there are these spelling-corrector programs , which will in many cases know what you meant , even though you have erm made a mistake . 
884832:158	###There is some professional resistance , in the sense that people who 've done a lot of work on programming get used to certain sorts of languages , and if you make proposals about teaching some new way of dealing with computers , they throw up their hands in horror , and object that this is going to be inefficient , or it 's not going to prepare people adequately for what goes on in industry , or whatever . ###Now , it may well be , that these objections will just be overridden by the market . 
884890:140	###I think it makes a lot of demands upon the teacher . ###It 's not something that is done easily or lightly . 
884909:24	###There 's been a recent H M Is report , which has asked some questions about mixed ability teaching and expressed some worries about those teachers who perhaps do n't have the adequate support and preparation for mixed ability teaching , but they 're certainly not against it , or the H M Is are certainly not against mixed ability teaching . ###What research in this area needs to be done now ? 
884914:21	###Well I hope to look more at mixed ability teaching . ###Really it 's a problem of erm time and resources . 
884961:20	###We certainly feel that this is a possibility . ###In fact , we would rather do it that way . 
885008:29	###He had lot of intelligence and not all that much education . ###I think he was conscious of a great deal probably , but at the same time many writers will tell you that they find when they 've finished a poem or a play things in it , demonstrably in it , systematically and intelligently present with real relations , which they do n't remember writing . 
885050:124	###Is that also beautiful ? ###Sorry , this is pretty mind-blowing , but he has got himself into difficulties because he things that beauty is not , so to speak , a logical construction that allows us to talk about particular objects in the world , he thinks it is itself a sort of spiritual thing . 
885071:17	###The bible , for example , I would have thought was a ###Yes , it could . 
885122:17	###They certainly could . ###The study programme is essentially erm addressed towards erm Third World countries , and it is supported by British technical assistance , and therefore a number of the participants , a large number , are funded by technical assistance funds . 
885144:40	###I know you 've just recently come back from Uganda . ###Are the economic prospects for Uganda quite bright ? 
885177:43	###And we have a stake in that . ###We also have a sort of partnership with other institutions in understanding better our stake in it and other people 's stake in it . 
885181:7	###Now is n't this a the sort of problem that you run into if you try and impose aid from outside ? ###Of course , and if you go back to the answer Beana was giving , even within a country if you try if we try and solve other people 's problems , one is very likely , if not always , to end up with those sorts of difficulties . 
885196:57	###The context is different , especially for an exporter of manufactures like Britain , but there 's a basic common question which arises at the root of the problems of erm technology choice in Africa , in Asia , Latin America and in a European country like Britain . ###Now the one thing that I think is important is that one cannot look at the problems of any given society in the world in isolation from the rest of the world as a whole , and in particular , in the case of underdeveloped countries , their problems are very much linked to the situations that take place in the developed countries . 
885244:82	###In other words , you are saying that the morality to be found in George Eliot 's novels is quite different from the more conventional Christian morality that 's found in other novels of that period . ###I do n't think that 's quite what I was trying to suggest . 
885335:145	###erm I 've got courses in Eastbourne and erm a course in Brighton , on medieval stained glass in fact . ###I 've always enjoyed teaching it 's something which I feel is very important for someone who 's an historian . 
885346:14	###We 're going to be looking at the contrast between that and places like Rye , which did have a chartered corporation , and we 're going to be looking at sort of trade , at the effects of epidemics on the town , erm and so on . ###I think it should be great fun . 
885353:8	###How much does it cost ? ###I think it 's six pounds fifty for the erm for the day . 
885378:80	###Well , it 's difficult really . ###erm architecturally I suppose it does n't compare with a medieval university . 
885390:15	###And that was when the university was very much on the British Council circuit . ###Do you think that still happens ? 
885419:7	###Well our lovely trip was to Athens last year , yes , erm when we did the Britten 's War Requiem beneath the Acropolis in the old amphitheatre there and that was an experience that we 'll all remember , and then previously we went to Lisbon , which was very exciting - it was a completely different sort of experience . ###Of course at the university you do your rehearsals , but the contact is greater than that . 
885427:14	###Another point of contact is the New Sussex Opera Group . ###You are now one of the committee member and the certainly put on productions in Lewes , but also at the Gardner Centre . 
885502:12	###erm yes , to some extent . ###It 's easier for someone who has a timetable laid out for them very clearly during the day . 
885671:30	###mhm . ###although I would n't push them into it . 
885687:66	###I feel and people get very emotional about maths . ###They suddenly , whether they 're boys or girls , they suddenly decide sometime in their teens perhaps they ca n't do it . 
885757:87	###And it 's hard , very often , for unemployed people to erm maintain their previous range of social contacts . ###You feel that you 're a bit of burden on your friends , perhaps , because you ca n't go to the pub and buy a round of drinks , because you 're bit of a drag on a lot of activities which involve spending some sort of money . 
885800:20	###Do n't you have all sorts of cultural traditions you 've got to fight against . ###I mean girls , their places are in the home are n't they , really ? 
885839:28	###They can write at home , they can write after school , they can read it to each other and I think this is tremendous benefit where they 're open with each other too and can discuss round the table and evaluate their own work . ###I think that 's a good step towards excellence . 
885870:103	###I recently found myself speaking to Geoffrey Norman , the Secretary of the Magistrates ' Association , about court procedures . ###Ideas in Action , Recording 199 Tape 5 , Side B - Magistrates ' Courts 
885880:148	###No . ###The decision , both as to the facts and the law , is for the Justices alone , so it 's unlike a judge and jury trial where the judge deals with the law and the jury deal with the facts . 
885896:21	###What percentage of people actually plead guilty to charges against them ? ###I do n't know the actual percentage erm but it 's pretty high . 
885905:12	###It need n't cost them erm any more at all . ###erm they can conduct the case themselves 
885922:162	###In that type of case erm perhaps the Court will not pay too much regard to the defendant 's personal circumstances because they 're not going to make that much difference , but if it 's not that serious a case the other main consideration that comes into play is the defendant 's own personal circumstance . ###So the first choice really is between erm a sentence which is not an individualized one and one which can be individualized in justice and all the circumstance of the case . 
885974:200	###Universities are very independent organisations and I suppose it , it 's more like a league than a governing body . ###Well that 's true erm and indeed , erm there is nothing we do which erm requires universities to erm to do anything other than they would have wanted to anyway . 
885980:36	###It is of no surprise to you and I to know that we are in a erm an economic crisis , and , but I think that we might be accused of being in an area that does n't take the fair share of the cuts . ###Are universities being cut as much as for example primary schools and secondary schools ? 
885981:37	###Are universities being cut as much as for example primary schools and secondary schools ? ###Well , relative to the size of the job we have to do I think the answer is yes . 
885985:21	###erm In that sense , whereas of course in the case of primary schools there 've been fewer resources but of course far fewer students . ###So in that sense the resources per student , the funds per student have in fact erm come down by in the region of erm fifteen per cent over the last ten years or so very roughly speaking already , and that 's a very considerable reduction in provision . 
886018:14	###And it 's a , it 's a tendency which I think we shall regret . ###It 's the last place that cuts ought to be made . 
886019:63	###It 's the last place that cuts ought to be made . ###But supposing we had to make cuts all the same , supposing we just were forced into it , would you suggest that the best idea would be to close down one or two universities , not Sussex of course but one or two of the other universities ? 
886035:34	###But it 's also the language of science . ###And even traditional descriptive areas of science such as biology are becoming more mathematical each year . 
886044:34	###But is this a good thing ? ###Surely children need to know what their tables are . 
886059:11	###I expect you 'll want to talk about computers later but there 's a simple computer game which , which shows a screen with thirty-six numbers from one to thirty-six . ###And then three dice , electronic dice are thrown , and you get three numbers showing up on the screen . 
886068:16	###The rule 's important , but it should come from a need of the child rather than be imposed at some arbitrary time when the teacher thinks that all the children are ready for that rule . ###I see very much what you 're saying , but is n't there a sense in which you almost need to absorb in an automatic sense some of the basic things ? 
886070:23	###I mean to have to work out from first principles erm four plus three is seven every time , you may be able to do that with great understanding , but there 's an awful waste of time if you 've got to understand it each time . ###Surely there 's a , a certain balance between the , as it were the rote-learning of , of fixed things , and the understanding of what you 're doing ? 
886070:46	###I mean to have to work out from first principles erm four plus three is seven every time , you may be able to do that with great understanding , but there 's an awful waste of time if you 've got to understand it each time . ###Surely there 's a , a certain balance between the , as it were the rote-learning of , of fixed things , and the understanding of what you 're doing ? 
886077:22	###Now if some of the mathematics they had learnt had been relevant to them and interesting to them maybe they would have remembered it in the same way they 've remembered plenty of other things that are important to them . ###We 've got to have the , the fact at our fingertips . 
886093:20	###Well , I think so . ###There 's considerable argument about this . 
886161:90	###Education is n't the same thing as intelligence , he had lots of intelligence and not all that much education . ###I think he was conscious of a great deal probably , but at the same time , many writers will tell you , that they find when they 've finished a poem or a play , things in it , demonstrably in it , systematically and intelligently present with real relations , which they do n't remember writing . 
886224:55	###He thinks it is itself a sort of spiritual thing . ###He thinks it is itself something beautiful that sort of swims down into our world and is incarnated in particular objects . 
886252:17	###I would have thought was a rich ground . ###it , it could . 
886279:91	###erm It could be that erm with a different political regime , you might get a positive commitment not to run down things like the schools , the hospitals , British Leyland , erm British Airways , British Steel and the rest . ###But certainly at the moment , erm and at least until presumably the next general election , erm nobody can see much light at the end of that tunnel . 
886281:119	###One of the difficulties , I would imagine , is associated not just with the level of cutbacks , but also the scale of time in which they 're have to be implemented . ###Well , that 's absolutely right , of course . 
886284:49	###That adjustment has not been without its advantages , in fact . ###Well , let 's hear about some of the advantages . 
886308:143	###Now of course you ca n't predict at the level of the individual school what the population is going to be , but you can nevertheless be very clear that the system as a whole is going to have many erm fewer pupils . ###Of course nobody knows whether that downward curve is going to start going upward again or how fast it is starting to go upward . 
886355:25	###I think it enables young , the young people that have been coming to those meetings to find out too the problems that councillors have and local authorities have , in actually trying to carry out the sorts of things they want . ###There 's an awful lot of paperwork that 's got to be gone through , an awful lot of people to see , an awful lot of red tape really to get through , first , I mean just to make sure that the thing 's safe and complies with health and safety standards . 
886379:110	###erm I 've got courses in Eastbourne and erm a course in Brighton on mediaeval stained glass in fact . ###I 've always enjoyed teaching , it 's something which I feel is very important for somebody who 's a historian , I do n't like just doing research without communicating . 
886388:14	###We 're going to be looking at erm the contrast between and places like Rye , which did have a chartered corporation , and we 're going to be looking at sort of trade , at the effects of epidemics on the town erm and so on . ###I should think it should be great fun . 
886395:8	###How much does it cost ? ###I think it 's six pounds fifty for the erm for the day . 
886416:82	###Well , it 's difficult really . ###erm Architecturally I suppose it does n't compare with a mediaeval university . 
886490:20	###Stephen Ball has been investigating the differences between streamed and mixed ability classes in comprehensives . ###Again , we shall be hearing about his conclusions in another programme . 
886504:61	###I think it 's , it really begins in the home , this , because mothers can do quite a lot in not educating their own sons to think of them as servants . ###A lot of women do this , they 're very tolerant about boys ' mess in the home and untidiness generally , and in a sense they , they lay the foundations , right from the very beginning , of boys ' growing up to think of women as kind of household servants . 
886547:31	###She remembers setting up her first home , right after the war . ###They were dockets that we had , after the war , to buy our furniture , because there was n't much furniture around , we was only allowed so many per family . 
886583:121	###That in lower income groups , not because you could n't afford to heat the bedrooms , but there 's a definite idea that bedrooms are for sleeping in , rather than living in . ###What direction do you see your research taking you in ? 
886592:10	###erm There was one particularly noted filmmaker , a man called George Albert Smith , who worked in Brighton , but there were others too , there was a man called John Bennett Stanford and another called Esme Collings . ###And Brighton , strange as it may seem , became , in Britain , one of the small pioneer centres where these first movies were made . 
886822:7	###What happens when you try and get below that ? ###It gets progressively harder to get down in temperature , does it ? 
886823:7	###It gets progressively harder to get down in temperature , does it ? ###You have to erm spend progressively more because it , it , it , it just is as you say much much harder to get down . 
886926:12	###These temperatures are incredibly cold erm and very low . ###You can get frost-bite only about ten degrees below freezing point . 
886929:114	###No , no , no , not at all . ###erm The low temperatures we 're talking about , Brian , are , are right inside erm very big apparatuses , so that as far as we 're concerned the room is just at a normal temperature and the low temperature is within a can within a can within a can within a can away from us . 
886946:24	###erm Secondly the result was that our intake this year has been particularly good . ###I think you may know that sometimes universities need to go into something called clearing , which is a last-minute applications process in erm in late August and September , to fill the last few vacancies . 
886954:20	###Ted . ###What advice can you give to anybody thinking about applying to university in nineteen eighty-five ? 
886982:7	###There are lessons in that for people thinking about applying this year , and who may not intend to take a year off . ###And the main lesson is that there are no short cuts to choosing a university course or choosing a university . 
887005:19	###So get the writing clear , the spelling clear . ###I think the third general point I 'd want to make is this : if you 're applying for a course at university , then it does n't matter what A-levels you 're taking , or what courses you 've put down for at the five universities . 
887021:12	###And that may take a week or two weeks in the school or college to get that done . ###And it 's up to the school or college then to pass on their application form directly to the UCCA . 
887080:23	###I know that your study was largely concerned , in fact totally concerned with primary schools , but do you feel that there is a difference between the parental role in a primary school and secondary school ? ###Yes . 
887221:9	###I started to dig in one corner of it , and I dug for six months , winter months , erm and erm managed a shallow pool which erm was n't what I had envisaged at all , but erm two snipe lived there and liked it . ###And then I decided very reluctantly to have an excavator and for three and a half days it worked down there and erm created a sort of Black Hole Calcutta and put all the stuff it had taken out , it spewed around so that it , there was just mud and no water . 
887244:30	###Terrible habit . ###Yes . 
887262:18	###erm About five years after I started it , I think everything was , was growing up , and erm I have n't done the major things recently , I 'm just doing gentle management . ###I used to do 
887266:12	###is it something that just looks after itself or ###No . 
887320:21	###I 'm essentially a social historian , although I sometimes think that if I wanted to find the right adjective , and I 've never been too much worried about adjectives , I would say I 'm really a cultural historian . ###Because I 'm not just interested in society , which can be thought of in a kind of abstract fashion , but I 'm very much interested in the expressions in ordinary ways of life , in the arts , in literature , in music , of the kind of society that you 've got . 
887353:117	###and Gibbon 's Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire is again a great historical work , it very wide-ranging . ###The footnotes by themselves are worthwhile reading . 
887375:67	###And there is no one single picture of English history which is absolutely right , in other words there are different interpretations of almost everything that matters in history , but what I wanted to try to do in that social history was to give some account of England 's past which was meaningful to people living in the late erm twentieth century . ###Not for professional historians so much as for people who really did want to have a version of England 's past which makes some sense sort of sense now . 
887391:81	###There are different scenarios , to use the term that science fiction writers and futurologists use . ###The different scenarios are there in the past just as they are in the future , and it 's the historian 's job in a way to explain why there are different scenarios , and to give some idea of how many of them there are . 
887467:24	###I think that one of the great problems , and I 've made a number of studies of individual Puritans in the seventeenth century , is that we talk about Puritanism and we think of Victorian Nonconformity . ###In fact , as Christopher Hill says , they 're as different as vinegar from wine . 
887468:12	###In fact , as Christopher Hill says , they 're as different as vinegar from wine . ###And one of the things we must n't do , in fact , is to assume that erm our seventeenth ancestor is just ourselves in funny clothes .

887591:23	###Recording 172 : The archivist and twentieth century Germany . ###3 February 1985 . 
887622:7	###erm I think there was a great erm stress on authoritarianism . ###I mean all the cliches really on Germany 's need to expand militarily , on the need to do one 's duty , to obey orders in an unquestioned way . 
887628:219	###erm Why is this ? ###One of the reasons , Brian , is that I think German history is too important to be left to the German historians . 
887630:62	###They 've not in the past shown themselves to be very honest erm nor very keen on going into their own archives , and I think it 's , actually takes people like me , who live on the border-lines if you like of the two cultures , to go in and discover erm sometimes embarrassing documents , embarrassing information , to confront them with it , in their own language , so that they have to take stock . ###If it were n't for people like myself erm then maybe the older German tradition of historical writing would still today be dominant . 
887638:9	###It is a handwriting that you could not read , for example , however hard you tried . ###It is as foreign to , to your eyes as the Russian script would be . 
887641:15	###And a lot of people at that stage give up . ###There are a lot of archives , but there are even more archives than you imagine there are because there are actually erm a huge number of archives in private houses and castles in Germany that are not public archives , and a lot of people do n't even know about these . 
887641:108	###And a lot of people at that stage give up . ###There are a lot of archives , but there are even more archives than you imagine there are because there are actually erm a huge number of archives in private houses and castles in Germany that are not public archives , and a lot of people do n't even know about these . 
887648:93	###Every time I go into a new archive I just ca n't believe what I 'm discovering . ###Just give you one example if I may erm which erm will serve to underline the sort of points that I 've been making erm to you . 
887719:151	###Three of the seven sections of A la recherche du temps perdu still awaited publication , and although one had been typed and corrected , none of them was yet in proof . ###The whole novel is in fact a voyage of exploration and discovery , erm exploration of the nature of reality and the eventual discovery of how this reality can be recreated for our detailed inspection by means of art . 
887720:94	###The whole novel is in fact a voyage of exploration and discovery , erm exploration of the nature of reality and the eventual discovery of how this reality can be recreated for our detailed inspection by means of art . ###And it 's this journey from external reality to the profound truths of art , a journey which takes Proust through a series of investigations of the nature of time , the nature of the intellect , the nature of memory , it 's this journey which I must now attempt to trace , and I perhaps just ought to say that I think I get abstract once or twice from this point onwards . 
887731:77	###Because like many of his near contemporaries , such , for instance , as Henry James and Virginia Woolf certainly , Proust was concerned to expand certain small but emotionally important blocks of time , to expand them so as to convey an experience fully and in detail , as one would experience it living through it . ###He sacrificed , he sacrificed the quick movement , the rapid changes of circumstance which a certain kind of reader demands , in order to match his description of thinking and feeling to the actual pace at which these things are experienced in real life .

887869:33	###erm For undergraduate teaching it also has a very high reputation for innovation and for creative teaching . ###Now , there 's a lot of controversy sometimes about getting into universities , and I want to ask you , is it very difficult to get into a university these days ?

887956:23	###Let 's move on to perhaps some of the legal aspects and some of the areas where we are actually concerned about violence at the moment . ###In the streets , for example , how can you actually decide whether a violent act has taken place or not ?

888074:234	###Now this use of a formula , making the , the formula as pliable as possible to take in all these different themes , seems to me very interesting , because it seems to me a point at which popular literature , erm or the so-called easy dividing line between popular literature and high art , becomes very difficult to judge , very fuzzy . ###I think generally in the erm classic detective story that is almost impossible to achieve . 
888103:47	###And it 's much more usual for that kind of thing to happen , so that you are more likely to get a , a minister who has a very good idea about how erm the civil service functions because he 's been part of it . ###There are all sorts of reasons why this is true . 
888145:207	###The rest were , came from all sorts of different backgrounds . ###The Civil Service in Britain has always this feeling that the problem with a specialist is that he may get too committed to his specialism . 
888147:42	###He may not be able to see the political and general interest wood for the specialist trees , and there is a sense in which there are obviously dangers of that kind erm and the generalist has always taken the view that it 's for the specialist to be able to explain his problems in language which , after all , politicians who take the final decisions will have to be able to understand . ###And there is some sense in this . 
888159:45	###Yes , because we 're all facing very much the same kind of problems . ###Germany , admittedly , has n't got quite the same high rate of inflation , but France has an inflation problem , France has an unemployment problem . 
888182:31	###Most people just listen to weather forecasts and either believe them or do n't believe them and certainly get cross with people like yourselves if it ###mhm 
888185:13	###The real work I suspect is behind the scenes in all sorts of different ways . ###Yes . 
888197:32	###Forecasting has obviously improved a great deal over the years . ###Is this largely due to being able to get many more measurements at many different places and stick them together rather rapidly using a computer ? 
888211:7	###Some of them are taken by instrumentation but others are eye observations . ###Now they can only represent the area that the observer stands in and can see around him , and erm this leaves many gaps over the surface of the earth where we cannot really be sure of what the weather 's doing . 
888211:110	###Some of them are taken by instrumentation but others are eye observations . ###Now they can only represent the area that the observer stands in and can see around him , and erm this leaves many gaps over the surface of the earth where we cannot really be sure of what the weather 's doing . 
888221:12	###There 's a tremendous amount we do n't know about the atmosphere . ###We 're always finding out new evidence . 
888234:49	###Is it , can we attribute this sort of thing to the erm areas of drought , the areas of flooding that are occurring in various parts of the world at the moment , and all these sorts of things , and we have branches looking into this . ###Then we come onto the , the real sort of erm bread-and-butter forecasting world , and erm as you rightly say , most people are , think that we just do the radio and television forecasting , erm perhaps read the newspapers and see the forecasts there , but there 's much more to it than that .

888239:25	###Some eight thousand or eight and half thousand erm rain gauges are involved , we get all the information from these being fed into us all the time . ###All these sort of things we , we keep tabs on . 
888243:118	###He will ring up and enquire . ###So now we 're having to charge for more of our services . 
888256:16	###And the Brighton area . ###Does that have good weather , compared with the rest of the country ? 
888353:13	###but I want to ask you , are you going to work on this idea of a core curriculum ? ###Well , this is certainly one of the things that we shall be looking at . 
888354:20	###Well , this is certainly one of the things that we shall be looking at . ###erm You must recognise that the general outline of school education , from primary and in secondary level , is a matter of policy , and this is in the hands of the D E S and local authorities . 
888366:40	###Well , this is certainly one thing that erm we want to look at . ###We 're moving into erm an age where , for example , there is a lot of unemployment , and one ca n't see that going away very quickly . 
888368:11	###It 's an age when I think erm children leaving school have got to be versatile , self-reliant and able to cope with very changing situation . ###We live in a technological age , and there are going to be major changes without a doubt , we 've all seen them over the past few decades , and into the future there are going to be many major changes . 
888368:64	###It 's an age when I think erm children leaving school have got to be versatile , self-reliant and able to cope with very changing situation . ###We live in a technological age , and there are going to be major changes without a doubt , we 've all seen them over the past few decades , and into the future there are going to be many major changes . 
888371:133	###So yes , we shall be looking at erm those sort of matters . ###Are you concerned with equality of opportunity for both boys and girls , for example ? 
888372:100	###Are you concerned with equality of opportunity for both boys and girls , for example ? ###Yes , that is something that erm we 've erm made quite clear , as a result of our first major meeting , which we held two or three weeks ago , that sex equality , sex stereotyping , are matters that have got to be looked into very carefully . 
888375:37	###Most girls opt out of the physical sciences . ###erm This has a knock-on effect insofar as if they 've once given up the physical sciences , then it means that they 've given up all hopes , when they leave school , of following a , a job or a profession , of courses in further or higher education , in technological , engineering subjects . 
888378:7	###So one thing that I 'm sure we 'll want to do is to support the work of the Secondary Science Curriculum Review . ###This is one of the projects that we 've inherited , incidentally run by another member of Sussex University , Dr. Dick West , which is recommending , and it 's getting a lot of strong support for this , that all children should have a balanced science education , including the physical sciences , up to the age of sixteen , and so that erm issue of choice will just not arise . 
888383:121	###Well , yes , mathematics is a nice , tidy , logical subject , and erm is a subject which erm terrifies a lot of children , and I think here particularly of the situation in primary schools . ###About erm eighteen months , two years ago a report was published , the Cockroft Report , this is the same Sir Wilfred Cockroft who 's chairing the Examination erm Council , which looked into the teaching of mathematics at all level in the country and it was an extremely good report and a lot has followed from it . 
888388:41	###They see them at home , it 's all around them , but the use of calculators for example has not really been built yet widely into the curriculum for primary schools , so that is an area that we shall be having a look at . ###And you 're not worried that the use of calculators at too early a stage would make a child quite incapable of understanding what addition and multiplication and so forth is 
888391:71	###I think erm certainly for a child to rely entirely on a calculator for all mathematical operations would be a disastrous thing . ###On the other hand , used aright , it can help very much in the understanding of mathematical operations , because far more many and widespread examples can be dealt with very quickly , and they can for example erm get a feel of the result of multiplying or dividing or whatever it , it is , numbers of quite different sizes . 
888391:93	###I think erm certainly for a child to rely entirely on a calculator for all mathematical operations would be a disastrous thing . ###On the other hand , used aright , it can help very much in the understanding of mathematical operations , because far more many and widespread examples can be dealt with very quickly , and they can for example erm get a feel of the result of multiplying or dividing or whatever it , it is , numbers of quite different sizes .

888399:42	###Yes . ###I should perhaps explain in the context of your various questions when I say that erm we do want to become involved in these things , that , at this stage , and we 've only held two meetings , we have just identified themes and general areas in which we want to work , and not precise projects or activities . 
888420:28	###Hello . ###Science is thought of as a subject that is difficult both to teach and to learn . 
888434:64	###I took my godson , Dominic Robinson , round my laboratory the other day , which is a physics laboratory , and he enjoyed it immensely and asked a number of questions , and was absolutely intrigued and fascinated by the various bits of wires and plugs and so on like that , and he asked me the sort of questions that I do n't think I would expect sometimes my undergraduates to ask . ###They were perhaps stemmed from innocence , but they were very searching and very real questions , and he was obviously very excited to ask them and to listen to some of the answers . 
888473:160	###Are they worthwhile , would you say ? ###Yes , they are ; they are very much . 
888503:40	###The most essential thing , in a sense , is to give teachers enough information about this condition and the kind of difficulties it creates so that they can recognise it . ###I do n't know whether David would agree , but my experience as a teacher was that I certainly encountered , I realize now , in my teaching career , children with dyslexia and yet no-one had told me , in my training , anything about this condition and I do n't think I was in a position until later , in a sense , to recognise that I had seen children with this difficulty . 
888503:111	###The most essential thing , in a sense , is to give teachers enough information about this condition and the kind of difficulties it creates so that they can recognise it . ###I do n't know whether David would agree , but my experience as a teacher was that I certainly encountered , I realize now , in my teaching career , children with dyslexia and yet no-one had told me , in my training , anything about this condition and I do n't think I was in a position until later , in a sense , to recognise that I had seen children with this difficulty . 
888507:140	###Did you feel that students there were receiving adequate information about dyslexia ? ###No , I 'm afraid I did n't . 
888507:160	###Did you feel that students there were receiving adequate information about dyslexia ? ###No , I 'm afraid I did n't . 
888530:22	###The dyslexic person has great difficulty with this . ###Then we come to the problem of sequencing which , one again , can be visual and auditory and connected with the hearing . 
888530:52	###The dyslexic person has great difficulty with this . ###Then we come to the problem of sequencing which , one again , can be visual and auditory and connected with the hearing . 
888532:16	###In order to spell , one has to combine both kinds of sequence , one has to think of the syllables in the word in the correct order and remember them and remember how far you got , and also remember the sequence of visual symbols , i.e. letters on paper . ###Sequencing is very often a the root of the dyslexic problem , not only in writing and reading , but also in remembering other kinds of sequence , like time sequence , which brings us to the next point . 
888675:18	###In a sense you can do the same thing , of course , with erm elementary particles like neutrons and protons , but the process of interpretation is much more complicated . ###Continuing our journey to ever smaller particles , can we break up the pye meson into anything smaller ? 
888678:41	###You mentioned , very straightforwardly , experiments to find these particles - in fact are n't the experiments rather complicated and requiring big , expensive bits of equipment ? ###To produce things like pyons , yes , they are . 
888678:97	###You mentioned , very straightforwardly , experiments to find these particles - in fact are n't the experiments rather complicated and requiring big , expensive bits of equipment ? ###To produce things like pyons , yes , they are . 
888678:151	###You mentioned , very straightforwardly , experiments to find these particles - in fact are n't the experiments rather complicated and requiring big , expensive bits of equipment ? ###To produce things like pyons , yes , they are . 
888698:179	###I suppose we should really begin at the word strangeness because the word strangeness goes back to the late Fifties , early Sixties , when some people discovered particles more massive than neutrons and protons and these particles were discovered in the erm cosmic radiation , and they were also produced by accelerators in laboratories . ###Now what happened was that these particles had very peculiar K properties .

888728:18	###The solar system contains not only our own planet , but also many other planets , at varying distances from the sun . ###And the whole size of the solar system is something like forty astronomical units . 
888766:62	###So if we 're talking about something talking about something taking a light year to reach us in terms of light , any possibility of human contact we 're talking about millions of years , probably , rather than a few years . ###Yes . 
888794:24	###Well you ca n't use that method , and indeed radar ca n't be used outside the solar system . ###The next method that is used is a method which again is familiar to people on the earth - surveyors use it all the time - and that 's what we call triangulation , and the idea there is that if you look at a distant object against an even more distant background , then the apparent direction will depend on where you 're standing , and if you move from one end to the other of a baseline , then a distant steeple , for example , will appear to move against the hills on the horizon . 
888800:45	###It goes once round the sun every year . ###That 's what we mean by the year , and at opposite sides of its orbit a nearby star , for example , will appear to be in different directions relative the background of very much fainter , more distant stars , and we can use that to see how far away it is . 
888804:46	###Yes . ###That method can be used to distances of about a hundred light years . 
888828:163	###It varies in brightness and the way that it varies picks it out . ###Its a sort of signature - you can recognise that particular kind of star - it 's called a sephied variable , and we know how bright that is and so we can use that to get distances to nearby galaxies . 
888911:9	###Well , not quite like this . ###I think this merely emphasises that each school is operating its own erm thing , as it were . 
888983:64	###So it could be used as a preliminary check for patients , more or less on a routine basis ? ###Before the doctors or the consultant actually sees a patient , then 
889011:12	###Do you have a medical background at all ? ###None whatsoever . 
889013:127	###So you do have to rely very heavily on collaboration with the local doctors ? ###Oh indeed . 
889037:49	###So what you would see is the machine , as it were , engaging the patient in a much more perhaps conversational mode and with much more feedback and response to the way in which the patient is answering the questions or behaving , rather than just , as it were , a machine which elicits information from the patient and compares it with a statistical set of data . ###Yes , whether one would ever actually get such a system interacting with a patient is difficult to foresee . 
889074:90	###That information is only part of the very large store of information that we need to retain in our own local computer , which contains records about , oh it 's about a hundred and fifty thousand of our four hundred and fifty thousand different books at this moment . ###Going back on what I said earlier on , East Sussex County Library , for example , keep their records of books , their catalogue , on a system which is run from the British Library , and the Polytechnic draws that sort of information from a co-operative which was originally based in Birmingham . 
889082:8	###That bit of information adds to other bits of information , all within the central store . ###We know what the price of the book was . 
889082:32	###That bit of information adds to other bits of information , all within the central store . ###We know what the price of the book was . 
889083:7	###We know what the price of the book was . ###We had to pay for it , so we had to send off a bill and therefore it knows what the price is . 
889105:191	###And you mentioned then how a floppy disk , that 's a sort of disk storage device , can be used to get a book printed . ###Is this being used at all in practice , or is it just a daydream ? 
889131:28	###Hello . ###Science is thought of as a subject that is difficult both to teach and to learn . 
889145:64	###I took my godson , Dominic Robinson , round my laboratory the other day , which is a physics laboratory , and he enjoyed it immensely and asked a number of questions , and was absolutely intrigued and fascinated by the various bits of wires and plugs and so on like that , and he asked me the sort of questions that I do n't think I would expect sometimes my undergraduates to ask . ###They were perhaps stemmed from innocence , but they were very searching and very real questions , and he was obviously very excited to ask them and to listen to some of the answers . 
889184:160	###Are they worthwhile , would you say ? ###Yes , they are ; they are very much . 
889202:153	###Well I think of myself , probably arrogantly , as an educational leader , but that certainly would include management as well as being an academic . ###If I can just say something about the management to start off with . 
889203:15	###If I can just say something about the management to start off with . ###I think sometimes people who do n't actually work in schools imagine that the schools are managed , in the financial organisational sense , by the Local Education Authority , and that in some way the head of the school is merely concerned with discipline , curriculum and so on , but one has to bear in mind that the sheer size of some of these schools now makes the head a manager in a very real sense . 
889220:18	###In the old days , life was simple in schools in the sense that if pupils did n't do what they were supposed to do you thrashed them , or made them stand in the corner , or expelled them . ###How do you actually make pupils do things ? 
889231:142	###I 've never seen it answered , but erm that did n't prevent the professionals from shelving it . ###But nevertheless , quietly , the community is getting more and more involved and having a bigger say at that level . 
889232:64	###But nevertheless , quietly , the community is getting more and more involved and having a bigger say at that level . ###When you come to internal democracy and how much , say , the pupils have , I agree with Bob that is a very tricky one and certainly you ca n't just transplant erm democracy onto what is really a rather authoritarian system , you 'd have to prepare and train pupils much more than we do and what I think is the most dangerous thing is playing at democracy which I am sure we should not do in schools . 
889246:151	###I also feel , Brian , we may be avoiding the question that or the part of this question which some of our listeners may be particularly interest in , and Bob did touch upon it , which is have things changed much in democracy in the classroom , is there a change ? ###I think there are some significant ones . 
889275:93	###Those I 'm not interested in producing reports and publications out of evaluation studies , I 'm interested in affecting the situation and affecting it to the mutual satisfaction of the people involved in it , and in fact when we 're when I 'm working with people on an evaluation , or discussing evaluation in general , one of the major items of our discussion always is how can you consult other people , how can you get them involved ? ###So one tries to build up a kind of agenda of all the things that different people involved think might be important before one tries to produce a plan as to how one 's going to work , and even then there may be a chance for you actually to discuss the plan with various people as well . 
889279:7	###If people are n't interested in an evaluation of something that concerns them , then nothing will happen at the end of it . ###I mean there 's no earthly use doing a beautiful piece of evaluation erm which no-one wants to know about at the end , or publishing something that has no affect . 
889281:87	###People have to be involved in something if they 're going to want to do something at the end . ###I mean if the evaluation suggests that something or other needs changing , then you want people to be already so interested in the evaluation and perhaps looking for useful things to come out of it , that they are already half committed to the changes . 
889302:17	###Do people sort of artificially put on their best behaviour , as it were , or something like that , and thereby give a sort of rather distorted impression as to what 's really going on . ###Most professional people are subject to an enormous range of presses and constraints .

889309:164	###Ah well that 's a difficult question . ###I mean there are obviously some aspects of a school 's policy that are relatively easily changed . 
889309:213	###Ah well that 's a difficult question . ###I mean there are obviously some aspects of a school 's policy that are relatively easily changed . 
889313:7	###And this is a very , very difficult thing to do because a teacher , I think , sort of maintains control in a classroom and is able to handle the situation because they 've developed working routines over a period of years . ###In a sense this is what it is to become and experienced teacher rather than a novice . 
889314:74	###In a sense this is what it is to become and experienced teacher rather than a novice . ###One has to develop routines to cope with the situation because it is far too complicated a situation to be handled in any other way . 
889361:7	###John Maynard-Smith is our Professor of Biology . ###He did , in fact , start in an other area of expertise - he took a degree in engineering at the University of Cambridge and worked during the War as an aircraft engineer .

889385:28	###If somebody can be persuaded to say something which is critical of Darwin he can get his name in the papers or on the box . ###Now erm in some ways actually this makes it rather nice to be an evolutionist because it means that people care , you know , people are actually interested in what you 're doing and that 's fun . 
889386:17	###Now erm in some ways actually this makes it rather nice to be an evolutionist because it means that people care , you know , people are actually interested in what you 're doing and that 's fun . ###People clearly are interested in what Darwin had to say erm and they mind about whether he was right or not , and I think that many people , I dare say many people in this room , have a wish which they may be conscious of and they may not , sometimes quite a strong wish , that he 'll turn out to be wrong . 
889401:174	###What 's it 's likely fate ? ###Of course you will appreciate that I am in no sense unbiased on these matters - I have strong and , I believe , correct opinions on these matters 
889437:205	###Stasis and then sudden change , which for reasons which do slightly defeat me , are called punctuational changes . ###The major claim is a claim which has been expressed as the claim of de-coupling . 
889440:47	###erm that then is the minor and the major claim being made erm let 's now discuss whether there 's any evidence for it erm or any evidence against it . ###erm let me consider first of all the minor claim , and here I think it 's only fair to tell you that I 'm not a palaeotologist . 
889440:117	###erm that then is the minor and the major claim being made erm let 's now discuss whether there 's any evidence for it erm or any evidence against it . ###erm let me consider first of all the minor claim , and here I think it 's only fair to tell you that I 'm not a palaeotologist . 
889450:60	###Let me now describe some work erm which points the other way . ###It 's work I have some familiarity with because by accident I happened to be the external examiner of the lad who did it , Peter Williamson . 
889477:116	###I 'll talk about monsters in a minute . ###Secondly , there 's no reason to suppose it happened in a small population . 
889493:48	###If , instead of following them that way you follow them a bit further north and follow them north of the Himalayas , then get smaller and greyer and paler , and the two ends of the loop meet in China and behave as distinct species . ###They do n't hybridize . 
889543:56	###Then there are a lot of changes that went place took place in locomotion. erm mammals , in other words , learnt to gallop and their elbows rotated backwards and their knees rotated forwards . ###Their backbone changed so that it would bend in a vertical plane erm the limb girdles changes and a whole number of other things changed associated with locomotion . 
889548:11	###erm some of us , but not all of us , started lactating ###and feeding our young that way , and some of us but again not all of us , became volviferous and actually brought forth our young alive . 
889569:154	###I ca n't see the point . ###They have an underlying community of pattern . 
889572:49	###And the theory of evolution which does n't properly understand the nature of these structures is really a jolly incomplete theory . ###You have n't said anything very useful anyhow . 
889595:12	###They walk on their knees and the front legs like this , so they stand on a knee and then those two legs , and then that knee and these two legs , so they ###The basic point I am making is I , you know , and this is quite unfair . 
889599:41	###Of course it leaves a problem unsolved . ###It leaves it unsolved , but all right , given that our ancestors had this because they wanted to swim sinusoidally and eat , you know , filter feed and do things like that , we do n't swim sinusoidally and filter feed why on earth do we are we so conservative ? 
889600:23	###It leaves it unsolved , but all right , given that our ancestors had this because they wanted to swim sinusoidally and eat , you know , filter feed and do things like that , we do n't swim sinusoidally and filter feed why on earth do we are we so conservative ? ###And I 've no doubt at all that the answer to that question has to lie in an understanding of the mechanics of development . 
889690:24	###It 's a beautiful , simple way of doing it . ###It 's not at all in the general knowledge of the sixth form science teacher , or certainly not of the O level science teacher . 
889716:32	###What I ca n't actually remember is whether Lovely War preceded my son and daughter came to Sussex . ###I remember Michael . 
889740:9	###erm have I ? ###Yes , well , yes . 
889750:15	###I think that Sussex in a way perhaps is n't quite as identifiable as it was and I think this does n't necessarily cause by any particular circumstance or group of individuals or individual or whatever . ###I think to a large degree fashion has something to do with it - the innovatory concept of Sussex was very exciting in the Sixties , it 's a bit old had not . 
889751:111	###I think to a large degree fashion has something to do with it - the innovatory concept of Sussex was very exciting in the Sixties , it 's a bit old had not . ###I think Sussex has got to find a new , new hat , and got to express itself and demonstrate that it is in no sense relying on twenty five years of erm of erm fairly high reputation that the next twenty five years and the next twenty five years after that are just as challenging , perhaps even more so . 
889763:131	###Yes . ###I was bitterly disappointed . 
889766:226	###On the other hand its subject matter I found overwhelming . ###One or two sequences worked quite well , but I hope I 'm a better director now than I was then . 
889780:29	###but I 'm digressing . ###I think it was a combination of it was an okay movie , but it was also a wonderful subject , a wonderful subject . 
889807:172	###And the movie is the story of their friendship and Donald Woods ' conversion , in a way , to the erm cause that erm called black consciousness which Steve Beeko erm promoted and so on , and it ends up with a sort of James Bond escape from South Africa in a way , in that Donald and his wife and his five children , harassed and threatened by the erm South African Government , finally escape . ###It 's an unequivocal condemnation of the obscenity of apartheid . 
889808:38	###It 's an unequivocal condemnation of the obscenity of apartheid . ###The great problem we face is that obviously the authorities in South Africa do n't want the picture to be made , and we 're shooting it in Zimbabwe , where we 've been made very welcome , and erm the difficulties is the creation of South Africa in Zimbabwe , which means you have to go all over the place .

889853:128	###Of course he belongs to the class which dedicates itself from the beginning , single-mindedly to literature , but yet not in the way we would think of . ###First of all , for instance , the preparation which Milton felt it was necessary for him to give himself , was neither technical nor introspective . 
889864:78	###He felt , in fact , that he was giving up his career . ###That , if solidity have leisure to do her office , art cannot have much . 
889872:10	###Of course we can talk about the standard of controversy in the seventeenth century and habits of erm arguing ad hominem more than , I suppose , would normally be acceptable today . ###All the same , what would you think of these reasons for inserting a piece of autobiography into the second defence of the English people , a defence of course for cutting off the head of Charles the First . 
889876:24	###Because I am , after all , the defender of the English people . ###You could suspect that this is a way of making it more rather than less egoistic , could n't you ? 
889885:98	###Indeed , it 's not only the writer who is depersonalised , but also the subject . ###It 's not Edward King , the man who was actually drowned and whom , as it happens , Milton hardly knew , it 's Lucidas , the figure of the young poet , priest , put to some extent on a classical model that he is writing about . 
889921:86	###That would be a gesture of supreme eloquence by Milton , the humanist . ###That would be an extravagance of classicallly based compliment and then Milton the puritan comes along and says to himself that wo n't do , we need a footnote , and in goes the footnote if true here only - do n't forget that these classical legends are all lies . 
889923:107	###Paradise Lost , like Colmris is a poem with a thesis , but the counter position of the thesis is so powerful that the poem , both these poems , have to be described as the enactment of a conflict , rather than the giving us of the result . ###The thesis , of course , is quite simple . 
889923:125	###Paradise Lost , like Colmris is a poem with a thesis , but the counter position of the thesis is so powerful that the poem , both these poems , have to be described as the enactment of a conflict , rather than the giving us of the result . ###The thesis , of course , is quite simple . 
889927:54	###For what sin can be named which was not included in this one act . ###Parasite , theft , invasion of the rights of others , sacrilege , deceit , presumption in aspiring to divine attributes , fraud in the means employed to attain the object , pride and arrogance . 
889930:25	###It clearly implies a world order in which the prime virtue is obedience , not a world order that 's exactly to our twentieth century democratic taste , but then after all not a world order altogether to Milton 's taste , as we can remind ourselves by thinking of his plea for unlicensed printing the Areopagitica . ###Obedience is , of course , to God and not to man . 
889950:94	###And of course he 's showing us Adam 's failure to follow . ###You could even say that Milton 's rejecting the future in this speech and saying I label sin what is going to become , if you have prophetic powers , new kind of ethic . 
889952:109	###And to justify the ways of God to men with such honesty , that is to say with such a complete account of what the price is which would have to be paid , is of course no longer to justify but to enact the actual conflict . ###It is no longer to come down on one side or other of the fence as the entire poem was so clearly designed to do , but to say following the ways of God will mean this . 
890000:36	###So that at the end of the day one has a much more rounded individual with of course specific talents . ###I 'm not for holding back children . 
890007:172	###How do you feel about parents teaching children how to read ? ###I think it comes to the same thing . 
890018:134	###Certainly , the most of the infant teachers I know take great pains to make sure that it is not traumatic and that the move from home to school is as easy as possible . ###Now having said that , often the trauma , which goes back to my original remark , is the sheer number of children , the sort of social impact that a reception class can have . 
890019:15	###Now having said that , often the trauma , which goes back to my original remark , is the sheer number of children , the sort of social impact that a reception class can have . ###Now if a parent can have introduced the child via nursery school to that amount of other children , then I think there should be very little trauma , but that is n't to say that as the child gets older they do n't have to do things .

890021:108	###But if a child has to do something because they can understand the end a which they 're aiming , in the way that a footballer has to train , or a boxer has to train , then it becomes easier to do the equivalent of training . ###One of the difficulties is that the end state is so far removed from the average child that it is very difficult for them to see why they have to learn to read , but if they can realize that if they learn to read in those houses where they have it they 'll be able to read the Radio Times and know what the television programmes are , that at least is motivating . 
890036:15	###When one calculates , for example , the beginning of the universe , using the methods you described , surely you 're making great assumptions about the laws of physics not having changed ? ###Yes , that 's certainly the case . 
890047:59	###It 's possible to formulate theories of very simple aspects of physics where the laws or the strengths of different forces , say like gravity , actually change from place to place and make predictions as to what the observable consequences should be , erm and to a very degree of accuracy one concludes that the strengths of the forces of nature and the laws and the rules of the game are not changing from place to place . ###They may be of course , but we may not have looked in the right place yet to find that . 
890048:243	###They may be of course , but we may not have looked in the right place yet to find that . ###I think it would be very exciting if they were changing , but I 'm afraid one has to be a reluctant revolutionary at the moment - there really is no evidence for that view . 
890049:53	###I think it would be very exciting if they were changing , but I 'm afraid one has to be a reluctant revolutionary at the moment - there really is no evidence for that view . ###I think really what happens when you go into the past is not so much that the laws that we now use change , but we just find that there are many more new rules and particles and things that can happen , so the things that we know are the same , but there are many , many more different types of interaction and particle in nature which we have no experience of , which we have to take into account . 
890113:11	###The subjects of the great centenaries lectures are , unsurprisingly , as diverse as human achievement , but in at least one respect they can , by and large , be spoken of together with widespread , if not indeed universal , recognition of their greatness . ###And so with Joyce we might talk , say , of the manageable stories of Dubliners and the still acceptable mixture of poignant retrospect and startling surges of feeling that mark the portrait of the artist as a young man . 
890115:48	###But then we have to move with Ulysses to a huge spinning-top of words which defies such judgements and leaves us clutching at apparently familiar images which so sooner appear than they are gone . ###And finally we would come to Finnegans Wake , apparently mocking our very attempt to read by calling in question what is , I suppose , the most basic of all assumptions about writing , that whatever form it takes it will be made up essentially of recognisable words . 
890118:97	###Yet , even here , there is a puzzle , a strange , unplaceable something which does n't quite fit with that account of the gradual driving out of the reader and the suggestion of a steady shift towards the rare and the difficult , for I would guess that anyone not put off in advance by suspicion or hearsay , anyone that is who has got as far as dipping into Ulysses , say , will have come hard up against things that are startlingly , even discomfortingly , recognisable . ###Words , of course , phrases , images , sequences , which connect with the very core of our inner experience , whether at its humblest or at its grandest . 
890134:13	###In the bewildering tracery formed by the work and by the claims and counter-claims that it has provoked , there is matter for a hundred lectures , and what follows is neither and attempt to summarize , nor a rival undertaking . ###I want rather , by focusing on a small number of closely related questions , and simple ones at that , to suggest something of how all this came about and why it matters . 
890144:56	###He thought of how she who lay beside him had locked in her heart for so many years that image of her lover 's eyes when he had told her that he did not wish to love . ###Generous tears filled Gabriel 's eyes . 
890179:29	###The very notion of making a literary point about the writer 's relation to language , however true , will have a cruelly mocking echo . ###What then can this Stephen , who is so piercingly aware of these things , and yet who proposes to be a writer , what can he do ? 
890197:7	###Still having eunuchs in the choirs that was coming it a bit thick . ###What kind of voice is it ? 
890217:77	###That to read the novel is to attend exclusively to the detail of a patterning . ###And there are many readers , quick and subtle ones , for whom that is so , and for whom , of course , the sense of screen , which I have been suggesting , can serve no purpose . 
890262:65	###He lacks social adroitness , or any kind of personal magnetism , as he struggles to hold down a charmless job which depends on the goodwill of others . ###He is Jewish - that is condemned to be an outsider in a world which knows only the Catholic many and the Protestant few . 
890276:55	###Yet , too keenly aware of his own different failings , to be able to outface them all . ###Such aspirations as he has are short-lived , stick almost in the throat , as the notes of the song might in the throat of an unconfident would-be singer . 
890298:48	###A bit of a singer , a bit of an artist , a bit of a man . ###If Bloom is every kind of Dubliner it is because it falls to him to transact the unfinished business , to enact it and to get beyond it without dazzling gifts . 
890302:7	###Bloom is not , and will not become , a hero . ###He is not Joyce any more or any less than Stephen is , but Stephen can only fly by the nets of nationality , language , religion and artistic mediocrity because Bloom cannot . 
890302:41	###Bloom is not , and will not become , a hero . ###He is not Joyce any more or any less than Stephen is , but Stephen can only fly by the nets of nationality , language , religion and artistic mediocrity because Bloom cannot . 
890312:28	###And the deepest of those secret sharings are with the child figure , the earliest stories of course , and with the women . ###Evelyn , or Maria , in the story Clay , or the nameless girl in Two Gallants , or Greta Conroy in The Dead . 
890331:43	###It is a version of something we all know now , and largely thanks to them . ###For if , as ordinary people , we are acutely aware that when it most matters the words we say are not thunderbolts from heaven but hostages to fortune , ways in which we reveal ourselves in our limitedness and imperfection . 
890358:25	###Catching up , however badly , our recognition of the decisive tension between eye and ear . ###I can conceive no response , no criticism which does not include the practical recognition of that tension , but such is the nature of Joyce 's last venture that I cannot , without cheating , read to you from it . 
890390:46	###What do you do to encourage him ? ###Try and find out what the problems are and find an answer to them , but sometimes this is extremely difficult . 
890411:24	###Ask if you can see the Educational Psychologist to discuss the problem with them , and really try and get specialist help . ###And if your child is dyslexic , reassure them that they are not the only child , there are other children who share this problem , that they in fact are not stupid , or mad - and quite often they think they are mad , they can understand what is wrong with them because they do n't really understand what they 're supposed to be doing . 
890434:81	###Other options are available to parents , both inside and outside the schools , Mary Nash-Wortham reports . ###Local parents should discuss the possibilities with the head of their child 's school , and if possible get the child referred to the psychologist , who will assess the child for intelligence . 
890435:45	###Local parents should discuss the possibilities with the head of their child 's school , and if possible get the child referred to the psychologist , who will assess the child for intelligence . ###If this method is barred because the headmaster does not agree that the child might have a learning difficulty called dyslexia , then the parents will have to go outside the school system and possibly go to the Dyslexia Institute at Staines , where a full assessment is carried out , with a report , which is sent to the parents . 
890442:18	###What sort of remedial techniques can parents use ? ###Mrs Durrant describes her own method . 
890454:8	###I think if parents are concerned and feel that their child is brighter than his performance shows , then it is time they took some action . ###The path is not easy for them , because they will be blocked by suggestions from the school that their child is a late developer , he 's lazy , or that he does n't like working , but this should not deter them .

890471:8	###But now , twenty five years later , Amos is still in our midst . ###Instead of finding students impossible to put up with , he appears to enjoy their company and they in turn appreciate him . 
890484:25	###All right . ###How long have you actually lived in this cottage Mr Chatfield ? 
890488:10	###Well I 've been I really do n't know . ###I was n't born really because I did n't have a birth certificate or anything so I do n't know how old I am . 
890510:21	###Well it 's eleven actually Mr Smith . ###I used to have three but I lost three sheep down when they built the university , and I have n't been able to find them , so I thought that they 'd be useful to try and locate them , you know . 
890559:10	###Yes we do . ###Goodbye . 
890559:13	###Yes we do . ###Goodbye . 
890568:158	###And as long as you did n't choose something that had a very bad dye , in which case it would all run , but mostly it was very light , it was easy to wear , even easy to clean , so it was an immensely popular fabric . ###The eighteen twenties and thirties saw fashion moving from the Empire line , which was , had a very small bodice and a skirt that flowed down straight to the ground to a lower waisted dress with big sleeves and a shorter skirt , and the impression of a little girl , a little sort of bouncy girl who was all skippy and everything , which reflected really the feeling of optimism at the beginning of the nineteenth century . 
890570:96	###The growth of the middle classes as industrialization became , got under way , men , more men earned their money , so instead of having two classes , the working class and the upper class who spent their lives in leisure , in idleness , you got another class of people who had to earn their living , but who still made a lot of money . ###And the reason for a , a lot of fashion and a lot of change in the fashions , one of the reasons is because these men had , needed some way of showing off their wealth .

890572:140	###Previously , in the eighteenth and seventeenth centuries , a man himself could dress and show how wealthy he was , and when man started going to work he had to wear a respectable , responsible suit ; he had to put across the image of honesty , of , you know , I 'm , I 'm a respectable man , I 'm decent , I 'm down to earth . ###So really man 's costume changed very little , and in fact , apart of the cut of the jacket , and the type of hat you wore , it carried on right up to the present day . 
890618:7	###That 's even better , but I did n't take it . ###This is a picture of Florence Nightingale and her sister who has an unpronounceable name , this is in the eighteen-forties , and this really summarizes I think , the psychological reasons behind the changing of fashion ; this shows the ideal woman of the eighteen- forties . 
890618:114	###That 's even better , but I did n't take it . ###This is a picture of Florence Nightingale and her sister who has an unpronounceable name , this is in the eighteen-forties , and this really summarizes I think , the psychological reasons behind the changing of fashion ; this shows the ideal woman of the eighteen- forties . 
890620:37	###You had to be the , the perfect woman who was one , who had grown up from the little girl of the eighteen-thirties who was all bouncy and skippy and optimistic ; now she had to be very quiet , she was admired for her innocence , for her delicate nature and her dainty physique . ###And it was her duty to be guided by an intellectual judgement and authority that was superior to hers - in other words , her husband 's or her father 's . 
890623:151	###And the costume itself enforced this , if you can imagine , you can see , see their upper sleeves , this is actually quite full round here , but the upper sleeves are quite tight , which means that you ca n't move like this very easily . ###You were very tightly corseted , which makes any exertion almost impossible because if you ca n't fill your lungs to take enough air then obviously you ca n't take enough exercise , which is why a lot of women would faint with shock or horror because any sort of sharp intake of breath , and they 'd be flat on their backs , unconscious . 
890631:236	###It does n't give a very realistic picture ; again a lot of the costume in museums , it gives a distorted view because the clothes that people keep are generally their best clothes - their ball dresses , their wedding dresses . ###The collection at Woodstock has goodness knows how many silk wedding dresses , but it would be wrong to assume that every Victorian woman went round dressed in a white silk wedding dress , because they did n't . 
890634:31	###Could I just ask you , did those bodices do up at the back with hooks and eyes ? ###Yes , that 's one of the interesting things about this . 
890647:202	###But she put it up here , I think probably to make it easier , I mean if anyone 's had , I do n't know if anyone had children in the seventies when it was the fashion to wear very long skirts , or even as I find going up and down stairs in my nightie , you 're more than likely to fall and break a leg and the baby 's neck at the same time , if you wear a long skirt . ###I think they found that it just was n't practical to wear very long dresses ; it was alright for dressing up , but not for every day . 
890712:49	###Ooh ! ###Actually , I mean , we 've got a big costume collection , I mean it 's sort of , you 're talking thousands of garments altogether . 
890712:76	###Ooh ! ###Actually , I mean , we 've got a big costume collection , I mean it 's sort of , you 're talking thousands of garments altogether . 
890712:97	###Ooh ! ###Actually , I mean , we 've got a big costume collection , I mean it 's sort of , you 're talking thousands of garments altogether . 
890713:33	###Actually , I mean , we 've got a big costume collection , I mean it 's sort of , you 're talking thousands of garments altogether . ###They 're not on show because displaying costume is very difficult , because you have to have very strict environment control ; and light has to be very dim and you have to watch the relative humidity . 
890746:177	###It has a governing body , which is formed from parents and interested people . ###In other words , you do n't have the political input that you presently do in erm state schools , and of course the school itself is not answerable to the Local Education Authority in terms of policy it erm it is almost a stand-alone exercise , with the financing coming directly from D E S . 
890783:40	###Seven , seven ###Absolutely . 
890808:35	###I mean is it an attempt by the Government to bribe these schools to opt out by giving them more money ? ###Well I certainly do n't think it 's a political stunt . 
890808:53	###I mean is it an attempt by the Government to bribe these schools to opt out by giving them more money ? ###Well I certainly do n't think it 's a political stunt . 
890833:54	###I personally believe that erm education has changed and I am now talking specifically of very small schools . ###I am not talking of secondary schools , although there are some very small secondary schools in Oxfordshire . 
890847:55	###That 's stating the obvious . ###but you 've got to you 've got to address both of those schools and ask yourself is it right for one to subsidise another . 
890874:17	###For instance , did you know that on average they have increased spending on books and equipment by ninety percent and that sixty percent of schools employ at least one more teacher and many employ more classroom support staff and that morale among teachers is widely reported to be higher , even where before those teachers opposed grant maintained status . ###We 've seen that with the City technology colleges , which are nobody talks about , surprisingly enough , when we 've discovered that actually industry is n't remotely interested in them , and of course in the first year of an opted out school one might see a bit of palm crossing with silver .

890905:21	###But the others could n't do it . ###That 's a worst case scenario . 
890929:7	###So that I 'm very supportive of parent power . ###But on the question of grant maintained , of course , let 's not forget what happened some time ago in places like Manchester Grammar School erm long before we had this new opting out legislation they were forced by the Labour Government to go direct grant , which they did , and they are a highly successful and I could rehearse just as many success stories , in fact many times more than Jack has rehearsed with his Hull Grammar School . 
890936:5	###There is a little blip at the moment , certainly , but I ###Little ? 
890938:10	###have to tell Bob whatever he might like to talk about that he turns it to the Poll Tax , the fact of the matter is that the Poll Tax is nothing to do with Oxfordshire County Council . ###Oxfordshire County Council was required to pre-set the amount of money it wanted from the District Councils who set a rate . 
890939:117	###Oxfordshire County Council was required to pre-set the amount of money it wanted from the District Councils who set a rate . ###They still have to pre-set the amount of money . 
890941:37	###This time the District Councils collect it from Community Charges payers , and whether you had a rating systems in place at the moment , or whether you have Community Charge , Bob and his high spending friends would still have to rein in their expenditure and recognise that the people of Oxfordshire cannot keep paying for his profligacy . ###Yes , I do n't want to go into the Poll Tax argument on this 
890954:51	###Now what does this mean ? ###It means that instead of County and District Councils you have one authority that takes over both sets of functions . 
890954:182	###Now what does this mean ? ###It means that instead of County and District Councils you have one authority that takes over both sets of functions . 
890968:7	###You did ask a question earlier on and I think the the erm behind the question was the suggestion that erm the Local Authority Councillors we have on the governing bodies are a terrible interfering lot of bigots erm and erm surprisingly you might like to know that they 're not really . ###They tend to they tend to be a bit noisier than the others , but actually they are very constructive , and on Banbury School Governors it 's not the political appointees that erm I 've seen as a problem particularly . 
890970:112	###You have to remember that on the whole the school is run by the principal and her staff and erm the teaching is related to the National Curriculum . ###The Governors control very much of the finances of the school and supervise what is going on .

891047:159	###We will of course keep you up to date : any development in the Gulf erm during the next erm fifty minutes or so , so stay tuned . ###But it 's your chance to talk about what 's going on ; here we are , day two of the Gulf conflict , and erm all the sounds on the first day were very optimistic from an allied point of view , but are we getting too optimistic ? 
891067:24	###You see , when you 're an Arab and you fight for your country , you are a terrorist , when you are a Jew , and I 'm not anti-Jewish , I 'm anti-Zionist , you are a freedom fighter . ###We betrayed the Arabs over the Balfa declaration , we betrayed them after they cleared Africa and the Middle East under Lawrence , we betrayed them in the last war when they backed our rear and allowed the ninth army , and I was there , to join the eighth army and get out , and directly the last war was over , we betrayed them again - there 's a complete betrayal of the Arabs in the Middle East . 
891099:20	###You think there should be more balance ? ###I think there should be , yes . 
891130:21	###Absolutely shattered . ###Okay , well if anybody else has 
891153:69	###I 'm not suggesting the military are , but that 's the impression coming off , that you know , all this is going to be easy , but I 'm sure it is n't . ###That 's right , it 's erm obviously with the developments this morning erm on one of the erm French news reporters having seem some Israeli war planes going off , I mean things are sort of worsening by the minute . 
891163:159	###erm you know , he 's possibly seeing things on television , sort of areas that he actually visited . ###mhm 
891234:40	###Hello John erm firstly I would sympathise with those that erm have been complaining about television programmes , although I erm did n't watch a great deal of television yesterday , I was listening to Radio Oxford actually , but erm from erm Ceefax I noticed that the Neighbours was broadcast twice . ###mhm So 
891247:17	###Planes were being lost and replaced only when the aircraft production was stepped up . ###Yes . 
891255:12	###Now with the absence of the Iraqi air force , are they being held back until we have lost sufficient aircraft , and with no back up aircraft , and erm then we will our erm airforce and our land forces will be under attack from the Iraqis and the war will be a prolonged war . ###mhm 
891257:82	###Because we must remember that Iraq has already had an eight years war and they 're used to a war , they used to withstanding a war and it was the only reason that Britain survived in the last world war because it could withstand attack , and wait and wait until they were ready to counter attack . ###Yes , I mean several points that you 've raised , and these are things that I 've picked up from the newspapers and I 'll make the point , I 'm no expert but I as I understand it , the allied erm forces have erm substantially greater number of aircraft in the area than the Iraqi airforce had , so that 's one point . 
891276:97	###Okay well ###And it gave the Air Force a chance to regroup . 
891295:53	###I obviously I from what was coming out you probably could n't work out very much to help you but nonetheless I know that I would want to do that as a person . ###Yes but I mean it 's like the lady said , I mean you get the same thing all the time . 
891311:33	###erm I ###Surely erm they were n't all connected with the M forty , and I expect possibly others whom should have been invited were overlooked . 
891324:53	###mhm ###And I understand that there was a reception which erm in as far as I 'm aware was actually erm organised and financed by the contractors who were building the motorway . 
891330:46	###Yes ###To tell us things are happening and certainly on the press release it made erm it was there in black and white to say that 
891393:79	###And we had a great deal of commercial encroachment that took place on it in quite illegally and unauthorised manner with Medley boat station expanding on to the banks , and the City Council have been working since nineteen seventy four would you believe , to try and end that and restore that land to common land again . ###So the council were faced were having to take a legal action because there was a whole claims that because the land was so old , nobody knew who technically owned it and it was n't registered as we owning it until nineteen sixty six , there was legal disputes about that . 
891415:7	###mhm ###Well it is three hundred and twenty thousand pound that they 're paying to this person that should not have been there in the first place , he walked on there , he built places there without planning permission and I think if the council had played their cards right , they could have got him off without paying out this three hundred twenty thousand pound . 
891431:20	###The next case we turned to was the question of ownership of the meadow ; I 've explained the confusion and the complications about ownership of the meadow because it nobody had bothered to register it until nineteen sixty six . ###And as the boat station had been there before nineteen sixty six , probably a hundred years before nineteen sixty six , it was then claimed that this person had adverse possession , which in short , is squatter 's rights . 
891437:25	###Well I would the only thing I can say in this is this cash , I know they said they 'd get it got in the piggy bank before the poll tax , but as they keep shouting about they 've got to put the poll tax up , they 've got no money , they they 're putting the staff off and one thing and another . ###I think they could have kept that money for that purpose what they want now , not to throw it across there . 
891437:94	###Well I would the only thing I can say in this is this cash , I know they said they 'd get it got in the piggy bank before the poll tax , but as they keep shouting about they 've got to put the poll tax up , they 've got no money , they they 're putting the staff off and one thing and another . ###I think they could have kept that money for that purpose what they want now , not to throw it across there . 
891488:113	###Oh , well that 's very kind of you , you 've been checking up have n't you , counting off the days on the calendar . ###Almost that , and I want to say that I have some sympathy for the lady who has children and just could n't entertain them for the day . 
891512:30	###Well a fairly typical one excludes anything which is faulty as a result of negligence or bad workmanship . ###If the crank shaft goes on a car after twenty thousand miles , is it a defect - mechanical defect - covered by the guarantee , or was it faulty workmanship by the person who put it into the car ? 
891516:40	###Somebody paid a hundred and eighty pounds for an extended warranty on a new vehicle . ###The crank shaft thrust washers have gone , admittedly after a fairly high mileage , but he thought it was covered by his guarantee - it is n't . 
891592:100	###Now at that point , when she received the letter and read the policy , erm we could have given her a better cover if it applied to that particular vehicle . ###But my point is the customer does n't know what they 've got . 
891592:179	###Now at that point , when she received the letter and read the policy , erm we could have given her a better cover if it applied to that particular vehicle . ###But my point is the customer does n't know what they 've got . 
891626:87	###It does n't supersede that in any way , and obviously if people do run into problems I mean normally a major problem in the first three months or three thousand miles is taken back to the dealer anyway . ###Over and above that , obviously this is where the advantage to the policy holder comes in because obviously if they get a gearbox problem that 's going to cost , say , a hundred and eighty pounds in six months time , they 're not going to be able to go back to the dealer and say look I want you to put this right for me , because obviously it is outside the statutory guarantee . 
891631:93	###If there is a vehicle on risk with us and a piston ring breaks , regardless of the reason we coverage the breakage of a component and therefore we would we would cover the cost of the replacement rings and the labour to do so . ###Yes , I think you 're drawing a distinction between what you do in practice and what you 're booklet says , so I am talking about the letter of your booklet and what you do in practice might be a lot better . 
891631:156	###If there is a vehicle on risk with us and a piston ring breaks , regardless of the reason we coverage the breakage of a component and therefore we would we would cover the cost of the replacement rings and the labour to do so . ###Yes , I think you 're drawing a distinction between what you do in practice and what you 're booklet says , so I am talking about the letter of your booklet and what you do in practice might be a lot better . 
891643:12	###It 's no , no ###It is a mechanical breakdown . 
891665:41	###erm yes . ###I mean obviously the reality is that obviously if you buy a mechanical breakdown insurance from a dealer and the dealer goes into liquidation then obviously that does n't affect the policy because the policy will still be handled by a company such as ours , and there are a number of companies obviously . 
891712:26	###I would guess that he has one of our Plan Three policies , which does actually have a limited of fifty pounds on the erm head gasket and three hundred pounds on the engine . ###Now obviously in in a situation where a head gasket goes , there 's no problem on that because that 's straightforward . 
891716:104	###Now in fairness it would n't be our responsibility to to pay for a new engine if the vehicle had been drive on . ###But it is guesswork because I do n't know the gentlemen concerned and I do n't know the full facts . 
891741:123	###It is a contract of insurance , it 's not an open-ended situation , and , yes , I think that people probably do get carried away with the euphoria of buying the vehicle . ###What I would say is that we endeavour to counteract that on the reasons that I 've stated , by virtue of the fact that we invite them to read the policy . 
891744:15	###In all that time we have actually had two people say yes I would like to cancel , of all the policies that we 've actually issues . ###Well how 
891746:67	###I think there must be a general acceptance of the insurance . ###Do you think that when people are buying the insurance that they have much of an idea about their consumer power ? 
891760:65	###thirty pound policy gives and the cover that a four hundred pound policy gives is totally different . ###I would certainly advise anybody to to look at the policy , and if they want more cover speak to the dealer that they bought the vehicle from , because it may well be that they could have erm a much , much greater cover which is of more value to them . 
891800:59	###However , if there was an insurance against it and they could claim against it I 'm sure they would . ###So I think that really sort of covers that particular point . 
891823:7	###We do n't , in fact , deal with the general public as such . ###We only deal through the trade by virtue of the fact that the vehicles are then covered under the Sale of Goods Act . 
891846:13	###But that would give a thousand pound parts and labour , and if you look at the coverage on a Plan Five you 'll see that it covers turbo charges , air conditioning , central locking , as well as all the mainstream power train , all the electrics and everything else . ###If you look at it you can see it 's very , very comprehensive . 
891852:91	###erm it 's very difficult , very difficult to answer a question like that . ###As an overall thing we probably take about a hundred and fifty phone calls every day from policy holders , and I suppose out of that you I suppose you people that have n't erm have broken down at the side of the road will ring up or something . 
891926:195	###It 's too early to judge really erm we all realize that the might of the international forces in relation to the Iraqui forces is quite different is much more . ###We are optimistic in the sense that there is a process of liberation going on . 
891929:48	###Yes , how did you escape ? ###Through the desert with my family and through the perils of the desert and erm it took us about eight hours to to go through the desert , which normally takes two hours , and it was very difficult . 
891930:38	###Through the desert with my family and through the perils of the desert and erm it took us about eight hours to to go through the desert , which normally takes two hours , and it was very difficult . ###We ran out of water and some other friends ran out of water and we had to help each other and we were getting stuck in the sand and the heat was very high because it was in August and it was around noon time , so erm some people actually turned back erm they could n't continue , unfortunately ; they are friends of ours . 
891950:15	###I mean what 's it like for them day to day living ? ###My husband puts it very nicely . 
891951:48	###My husband puts it very nicely . ###He says you have to have erm nerves of steel . 
891951:78	###My husband puts it very nicely . ###He says you have to have erm nerves of steel . 
891952:13	###He says you have to have erm nerves of steel . ###By now they are probably nerves of iron because , you know , you have to co-exist with an army like that he has to really take it fairly easy because they can be quite rude and , you know , shove you around get whatever they want and very harmful methods . 
891985:41	###Is it necessary ? ###Well I think this war the aim of this war is to achieve erm minimum casualty , and by doing what the allied forces are doing by denying the Iraqui forces the logistics such as transportations and communication system is very vital to reduce the power of the enemy and then you can force him to retreat , or you can weaken the army that will result in minimum casualty for the allied forces . 
892043:40	###I 'm not sure , but Kuwait was a very important a very important erm port . ###Yes , we had many trade lines with India and the eastern coast of Africa . 
892077:24	###And even if they transfer money ###Jossom . 
892083:42	###What happens to them on their retirement from their working life ? ###erm there is for the Kuwaitis erm we just recently started a social security system for the Kuwaitis . 
892087:7	###Unfortunately , all the ex-patriots , including the Kuwaiti , lost everything they had after the invasion . ###In other words the Iraqui forces took over the banks , they looted everything . 
892090:92	###Well these ex-patriots , I 'd like to look at their situation a little bit more carefully . ###Is naturalisation open to them ? 
892092:56	###Yes , but very restricted erm in other words if you look at the history of Kuwait for the time that we received or we got our independence , we had to start our nationalisation process as an independent country . ###At that time it was more erm easy to get Kuwait nationality , so we have Egyptians , we have Palestinians , we have Indians , we have Pakistanis , Iranians who got Kuwaiti nationality when it all started . 
892096:58	###Yes . ###How long does it take about ? 
892096:84	###Yes . ###How long does it take about ? 
892148:148	###Does the will of the Kuwaiti parliament transcend the will of the Emir and does parliament carry the day ? ###Yes , who 's got in the hierarchy of power , who really is top dog ? 
892150:63	###It is the people , the parliament actually , because the Emir when he proposes a cabinet the parliament can accept the cabinet , or change , or request it to be changed and even the Prime Minister , which is proposed or nominated by the Emir , the cabinet has to approve him , and together they they run the business of the government . ###However , the Emir has the right to dissolve the government temporarily . 
892154:25	###Yes . ###can anybody overrule it ? 
892158:20	###Has he got to pass it ? ###He can . 
892168:67	###Yes , at this moment they do not vote . ###Yes . 
892194:34	###Are you less severe in Kuwait ? ###Jossom . 
892204:55	###Usually they go to civil courts , such criminals like stealing or killing , you know things like that . ###Yes , what will go to the Islamic one ? 
892227:148	###Did Kuwaitis actually fight or die in that war ? ###No , no , there was no military participation of any sort . 
892238:7	###Four hundred thousands . ###Now 
892261:125	###I do n't think we 'd like to now , under this emotional shock , try to justify what happens between the people the community of Kuwait . ###I 'd like to be very clear here that emotionally and using emotions now against your intellect , I think it 's very dangerous and it is we like to avoid this . 
892328:13	###It 's quite commonly said that twenty years ago the universities and colleges decided to treat students as adults and leave them to organise their own affairs erm and the argument about what to do in this area is n't an argument about whether it 's a serious problem , but about what are appropriate and even effective forms of intervention . ###I think I think the only thing that I would disagree with there is that I strongly suspect that a lot of tutors in the university , not just women tutors but across the board , really have little idea of the level of sexual harassment that students that female students have identified as being problem in the questionnaire . 
892329:10	###I think I think the only thing that I would disagree with there is that I strongly suspect that a lot of tutors in the university , not just women tutors but across the board , really have little idea of the level of sexual harassment that students that female students have identified as being problem in the questionnaire . ###Now I 'd have to say when I saw the report in the Observer , which was a couple of months ago , the rape in the quad report , my feeling was that this was a national newspaper picking on Oxford because Oxford and sex makes great headlines and it was going to be a good sell , and I felt that it was inappropriate in that sexual harassment is a problem in other campuses . 
892411:33	###None of us wanted to answer that because none of us think there are any ###You 're co-proctor is a man . 
892428:15	###You do n't look too bad yourself . ###But , yes , I think that there is a problem with the way men are becoming much too aware of this issue and maybe that 's just 
892439:95	###that as you move into a new form of behaviour ###Well how are you going to break these eggs ? 
892441:56	###Well , I think the first starting point is asking men to be self-aware and if one of the untoward consequences of that self-awareness is self-consciousness , then we 'll just have to live with that . ###In twenty years time maybe they wo n't feel so self-conscious , but I do n't think we should lost sight of the point that what they 're getting a tiny , tiny sense of is what women , a large number of women , feel all the time . 
892441:89	###Well , I think the first starting point is asking men to be self-aware and if one of the untoward consequences of that self-awareness is self-consciousness , then we 'll just have to live with that . ###In twenty years time maybe they wo n't feel so self-conscious , but I do n't think we should lost sight of the point that what they 're getting a tiny , tiny sense of is what women , a large number of women , feel all the time . 
892464:8	###I mean I think there are two problems here . ###There is a question of powerlessness , on the other hand there is the question that , you know , even if you 've got power do you constantly want to be having to police your own bodily boundaries , as it were , and I do n't think it is right to ask women to be doing that . 
892471:52	###I think , though , what 's very important in that as well is that I know that there are young men in the colleges who are really ashamed of the sort of picture that 's increasingly being presented . ###Whether that shame is yet moving them to have an impact on the men who they see perpetrating this sort of behaviour in colleges I do n't know , but certainly some of the undergraduates I have spoken to feel very embarrassed that this is the portrait of male behaviour that 's being perpetrated . 
892495:43	###I think it 's true to say that we give it to them and we also drink it ourselves . ###Well , yes . 
892502:136	###Well , no , I do n't agree with you . ###I mean I think that what that article is directing , you know , it 's main thrust towards is the importance of providing support and the importance , I think , of providing an avenue whereby people can deal with those sorts of problems . 
892510:156	###I mean where do you think that line should be drawn ? ###Well for my own part I think that one can educate students as far as possible in terms of what appropriate behaviour is , and I think that you can police students with disciplinary measures when it 's absolutely clear that when they know what the inappropriate behaviour is they nevertheless make a choice that they 're going to move beyond those boundaries of appropriateness . 
892511:212	###Well for my own part I think that one can educate students as far as possible in terms of what appropriate behaviour is , and I think that you can police students with disciplinary measures when it 's absolutely clear that when they know what the inappropriate behaviour is they nevertheless make a choice that they 're going to move beyond those boundaries of appropriateness . ###But I think that to allow those two sort of issues to get too inseparable , as it were , to so that we simply regard ourselves as being in a position to issue directives about behaviour , which do n't acknowledge that these are young people who have to learn to be autonomous , then we get ourselves onto a hiding for nothing . 
892540:187	###mhm I think the interesting ###Suzanne Gibson . 
892567:62	###Well clearly ###And I think that 's where the problems emerge , that they 're not doing anything , I think , quite often different to the sort of behaviour one might find elsewhere , but there 's a question of how , as an institution , you regulate the behaviour that 's acceptable within your own walls . 
892618:31	###But they are unable to process this and obviously that will be different for children at different stages of their development erm younger children being particularly susceptible to the sort of atmosphere around them , and if they are picking up from the adults around them , be that through the media or within the context of their everyday lives , that there is something dangerous and disturbing going on , then they are obviously going to reflect that unease in their behaviour . ###Yes , I 'm I 'm Elizabeth Capewell . 
892634:44	###Well , even even people who perhaps are not so experienced in doing it in their personal lives can be influenced I think , especially when they are relating to children , to perhaps become more sensitive to that and the children in their care . ###Yes , Elizabeth Capewell . 
892654:21	###Because they consider themselves to be strong , in power , in positions of power and coping well , and then all of a sudden to have something like this war going and carpet bombing going on and the use of chemical weapons and germ warfare . ###mhm 
892675:112	###Well let 's talk about where it 's emanating from . ###Now a lot of times when people are n't assertive that 's because of what - they have certain attitudinal approaches that are ineffective in certain circumstances , or what ? 
892695:103	###No , that 's all right . ###Elizabeth Capewell . 
892747:126	###I mean I think it 's bot of a parallel with the business of kind of giving money to charity to to help people who have n't got enough to eat . ###I mean , you know , if you see an advert in the paper that tells you that every fifty pence you spend is going to save a child 's life by providing it with Diralite or providing it with food that it needs for a money , or something like that , I mean how can you justify keeping any fifty pences at all yourself ? 
892769:7	###In Witney we 've got a big industrial estate and on the top of a forty foot pole there is a siren that was put up four years ago . ###We 've sent letters to everybody , the Home Office , everywhere , and to say why have they put it up in the middle of an estate . 
892778:20	###mhm All right . ###Elizabeth Capewell here in the studio . 
892784:114	###That 's right . ###And so children are learning that behaviour from their parents . 
892785:8	###And so children are learning that behaviour from their parents . ###They learn , as Elizabeth said earlier , you know , we 're models and children learn more by what we do more than what we preach , so you know we do have to repair what we did n't learn maybe earlier on . 
892797:105	###Yes , with a couple of points . ###Let 's go back to Elizabeth here , Elizabeth Capewell . 
892797:129	###Yes , with a couple of points . ###Let 's go back to Elizabeth here , Elizabeth Capewell . 
892846:15	###First of all , many people have been asking me on this programme in the past what credentials you people on the Council have for setting a budget . ###You 're dealing with millions of pounds , you 're dealing with very important parts of peoples lives here in terms of services . 
892872:7	###Nineteen eighty five . ###Yes , six short years ago when you started on the Council . 
892877:34	###But that 's what one learnt . ###As a Councillor one learnt the art of politics really , as a young Councillor certainly . 
892916:151	###What do you say to them ? ###David Waldon . 
892925:151	###We did decide that we should reduce the money that is received by Councillors , and so they were proposals that were made along with other proposals about reductions in members ' services . ###I do think it 's very easy to say that sums of money are not financially significant . 
892937:9	###We see the future of the education service depending upon local financial management , and erm , as I have said , we were very keen to protect the delegated budgets which erm by and large we erm have succeeded in doing . ###We could not avoid , we felt , erm a small part of the fixed cost to the primary schools being cut , but that was offset by a provision for additional staffing in the primary sector , which we identify as an important item . 
892937:118	###We see the future of the education service depending upon local financial management , and erm , as I have said , we were very keen to protect the delegated budgets which erm by and large we erm have succeeded in doing . ###We could not avoid , we felt , erm a small part of the fixed cost to the primary schools being cut , but that was offset by a provision for additional staffing in the primary sector , which we identify as an important item . 
892937:190	###We see the future of the education service depending upon local financial management , and erm , as I have said , we were very keen to protect the delegated budgets which erm by and large we erm have succeeded in doing . ###We could not avoid , we felt , erm a small part of the fixed cost to the primary schools being cut , but that was offset by a provision for additional staffing in the primary sector , which we identify as an important item . 
892939:96	###So we had to as far as all the schools and colleges were concerned erm there was a previous Council agreement that erm increments , that is the progression of Council employees through their salary scales , that had to be funded from what we call base budgets this year , so the budgets of the the delegated budgets of schools had to erm bear that cost along with everybody else . ###What does that mean in practice ? 
892962:10	###Another ten pence a meal . ###It will mean yes , about that . 
893025:8	###There may be none . ###Last year there were some , so the Liberal Democrats took the view that we could only properly set a budget at the capping level and that is a level at which we set our budget and it was a level at which we set our budget back in December and right through to this date . 
893060:165	###I put that as an amendment , not reiterating the entire Labour budget , but I asked the Liberal Democrats , who purport to want to erm provide that sort of service to vulnerable people could they not accept that extra half a million pounds as an amendment , and two out of the group abstained , the rest of them voted against that as an amendment . ###Well let 's put that to the Liberal Democrat member here , John Cochrane . 
893075:34	###Yes , five hundred thousand . ###That 's good . 
893088:75	###Yes , I did in fact erm whilst when we were going through the education proposals erm I did list reductions as John has mentioned , but I did also include the extra valuation for primary staffing that erm has went into our budget and the Liberal Democrats and I think Labour 's originally , which is now included in the combined Council budget . ###But I 'd like to comment on what erm also John said about the new duties in the social services relative to the Children 's Bill and care in the community . 
893128:85	###To be decided . ###That 's to be decided . 
893131:7	###Yes . ###Remember we 're talking about people who are eighty or ninety moving a bit . 
893160:112	###John Cochrane from the Liberal Democrats . ###just come in there because we 've found the response to the SNAS service was a little patchy . 
893160:122	###John Cochrane from the Liberal Democrats . ###just come in there because we 've found the response to the SNAS service was a little patchy . 
893178:57	###Yes . ###I 'm sorry , it is difficult to keep all these things entirely in one 's mind erm 
893194:60	###The fixed cost element . ###What will this mean in terms of provision for people ? 
893194:133	###The fixed cost element . ###What will this mean in terms of provision for people ? 
893210:55	###Well I ca n't say that everybody 's going to be dancing in the streets , those who are teachers in the sixth forms in the schools that will be affected , but I think again you 've got to have a look at the overall and longer term provision of these things . ###There 's it will still enable them to provide a tolerable service , and when it is a question of assessing priorities in any kind of cash limitation exercise you 've got to look at your priorities . 
893210:111	###Well I ca n't say that everybody 's going to be dancing in the streets , those who are teachers in the sixth forms in the schools that will be affected , but I think again you 've got to have a look at the overall and longer term provision of these things . ###There 's it will still enable them to provide a tolerable service , and when it is a question of assessing priorities in any kind of cash limitation exercise you 've got to look at your priorities . 
893219:56	###The fixed cost provision is not the major part of the funding of the sixth form , there are other parts of it . ###mhm Well let 's talk about 
893223:10	###We really do need to look at the Bill ###All right . 
893255:15	###And now we 're heading back down ? ###Now we 're doing a little bit of reversion and it is much regret by God for five years I have negotiated budgets with the Labour group against intense opposition to Conservatives and central government to improve the services in Oxfordshire . 
893265:59	###take the view that erm they are put up by the Council from time to time for various reasons . ###They were put up yesterday because of the problems with the Social Services Department , one of which of course was it 's previous overspend . 
893267:15	###erm I cannot deny that erm they will not be received at all well by those that have to pay them . ###But what will it mean to the people ? 
893272:114	###It will mean a reduction in services . ###Well will it ? 
893304:21	###I think the services will be worse . ###They will be worse for frail , elderly people , for physically and mentally disabled people , and I think people will also be asking the Tory and Liberal Democrat groups why they went for half a million pounds less than they need have done in service provision . 
893324:70	###Well to do that , Bill , I need to take you erm through the detail of the budget . ###Way back in December , when we were first rehearsing erm the problems erm we were facing a hundred and seventy compulsory redundancies , the closure of an adult training centre , the closure of an elderly persons ' home , erm the closure of a hostel and a whole range of other quite draconian measures . 
893327:27	###Yes , let 's start right now . ###Go right down . 
893333:15	###Though that will be a charge for elderly people attending Day Centres for elderly people , mentally handicapped people erm disabled people and so on . ###The charge will be two pounds a day , which will include their meal , for which they already pay erm I think it 's ninety p at the moment , so effectively it 's an increase of a pound and ten p . 
893359:30	###What will be your criterion ? ###Well 
893363:137	###People who , quite obviously when they get in touch with us , there are special financial circumstances . ###You could make up some theoretical examples . 
893396:41	###Yes . ###What level was that ? 
893423:29	###So not all administration equals bad , not all management equals bad . ###The other thing I 'd say is that the budget settlement that we 've got introduces a further hundred thousand of investment in new technology , and this is part of our push to making us more efficient in the way we manage our budgets and all the rest of it . 
893424:15	###The other thing I 'd say is that the budget settlement that we 've got introduces a further hundred thousand of investment in new technology , and this is part of our push to making us more efficient in the way we manage our budgets and all the rest of it . ###But I do agree that people out there must keep wondering how do they know that we are as , as it were , as slim as we can be . 
893443:7	###We 've just as I 've just said , we 've just finished reorganising our department . ###We 've got a brand new management team coming into place on the first of April . 
893449:86	###We 've got good communications . ###We 're not out of touch , etc . 
893461:43	###Now what this means is we wo n't be able to improve the staffing levels in homes that we 'd planned , four hundred thousand pounds worth of that , and that is sad , but at least it 's not throwing people out of work and reducing the current staffing levels . ###But what does this means for the homes in particular ? 
893506:14	###mhm ###Because obviously we ca n't close it just like that . 
893529:57	###We will , when we go to committee in April , say all this . ###We 'll report all this to the Council . 
893545:8	###I was quite impressed by what they did . ###I 'm sure a lot of Councillors were gob-smacked , and what happened is that Councillors were caught on the hop . 
893587:102	###More than the closure of a forty bedded home . ###So we will be able to locate the residents of whichever home we choose within a very tight geographical area , giving them choices as to where they go . 
893593:61	###And increasingly dependent and probably quite erm accustomed to the way their life is running in the home . ###Yes to all those , but do n't think also that we 're not able to construct a process which does that sensitively , because we 've got experience of doing that . 
893636:7	###Now in October of this year this is the biggest piece of legislative change in child care law for a generation and it 'll shift the whole emphasis of child care services , not just children in care , but support to families in all sorts of situations , from an old out of date system to one very much where the emphasis is on the County Council erm supporting families and their children . ###It 'll involve us developing visiting schemes , under eight services , helping families in different ways , improving services for disabled children , developing family centres , and a new specific - this 'll might amuse you this - a new specific responsibility for us to inspect and register the care practices of private schools in the County , and Oxfordshire has got the biggest number of those in the whole country . 
893652:23	###We 've also got to implement the famous Community Care Act , which implies that we 've got to set up an inspection unit of all our own services . ###We 've got to set up a proper complaints procedure , so that people know how to complain about Social Services , although I doubt very much whether anybody would ever want to complain about Oxfordshire 's Social Services , and so on . 
893654:26	###And that 's money we have to spend , and it in a way that was a controversial decision because members of the Council were genuinely concerned about spending money on what might be seen to be central services , when they were having to face not improving staffing in elderly persons ' homes . ###So we 're going to keep we 're going to try and keep our costs on this obviously stripped down to an absolute minimum . 
893664:11	###From that day Social Workers in Oxfordshire will be appearing in Court . ###The Court will have menus of orders they can dish out . 
893695:24	###Yes , your views . ###Bill , I have been receiving home help , for which I 'm very grateful , a good service , but I paid four pound forty five a week for somebody to come in and just wash and dress my wife in the morning . 
893723:146	###All right . ###I just want to give my view on the budget . 
893729:21	###We 've balanced out . ###You may say we 've robbed Peter to pay Paul , and there 's some truth in that , but we have n't at the end of the day gone further than that . 
893734:15	###That 's , I think , number one . ###Secondly , I think they 'll reflect in their own ways the sort of thing I 've said . 
893818:21	###He does n't talk to me much now because I 'm afraid I 've been the one who 's been tipping him out of the church when he 's smoking . ###How do you tip him out when he 's got a lot of ash on him ? 
893876:23	###And erm a swimming bath . ###Absolutely . 
893876:69	###And erm a swimming bath . ###Absolutely . 
893969:52	###Is it enlarging ? ###erm yes , it is . 
893976:165	###Yes , Martin Flatman . ###Indeed , we have tried to offer him accommodation erm to help him , to offer him a deposit erm for a room . 
893979:73	###I mean we support The Porch financially and with people going to work there precisely for the same reason . ###And then of course I , like many vicars , have , you know , literally hundreds of people with different problems coming to the door . 
894013:109	###erm unfortunately , it might sound extremely erm severe , but I can think of a number of people I 've met in my experience as a pastor who really and frankly could not help themselves and need to be treated almost like children again and made to receive help , and there are quite number of those sort of characters , unfortunately , on the streets of Oxford . ###But they 're not the only ones , by the way , I 'm also concerned about the fact that more and more young people seem to be in this syndrome and I 've a feeling that that comes down not just to government things , but also to the problems in the family as a whole . 
894014:7	###But they 're not the only ones , by the way , I 'm also concerned about the fact that more and more young people seem to be in this syndrome and I 've a feeling that that comes down not just to government things , but also to the problems in the family as a whole . ###Children leaving home because they 've been abused physically or sexually erm or verbally erm the breakdown in the quality of family life has also got something to do with all this business and that has got to be addressed as well , and money wo n't change that . 
894019:15	###I think when you 're talking about forcing people into doing things erm I think you 're getting into the bounds of that sort of The Mental Health Act area ###Yes . 
894042:27	###erm there it is very difficult , all the cases we work with are fairly miscellaneous , so therefore have very individual problems , you know , that are different every time , so the anger is going to be different , but we come down to a lot of fundamental erm similarities erm often to do with bureaucracy and structures erm which people just do n't fit into , you ca n't force people to fit into boxes . ###mhm And Sister Jenny . 
894065:56	###Just one little point . ###But if you talk to them nicely you can which we mostly do . 
894121:126	###He was evidently very well educated , and he was just turned out on the road , and I do n't know where he is now . ###Well , I think you 're you 're putting your finger on the issue that we brought up at the very beginning about this man in the churchyard . 
894205:53	###I wondered if I was going to get a word in edgeways some time . ###You 're from the Labour group . 
894208:196	###I want to go back to your original question that you asked Bob Morgan , because you were asking him erm why there was a reaction to a gipsy site . ###All right . 
894216:13	###erm the old-fashioned Romany gipsy , about whom we all have romantic ideas that are well out of date , to tinkers whether they are Irish or Scots . ###We have no responsibility for what he called the hippy drop outs , who call themselves new age travellers .

894370:134	###Counties are designated all over the south . ###I have gipies coming up from Somerset into my county division because they have been moved on because Somerset is designated . 
894371:7	###I have gipies coming up from Somerset into my county division because they have been moved on because Somerset is designated . ###Now Somerset is a long way away , but the first stopping place that they can find where they will be left undisturbed for a few days is in the Vale , and very shortly the Vale will be designated , so they 'll have to travel even further into west Oxford , which is going to be , if we 're not careful , the only undesignated district in the whole of the south of England , and I would n't want to be a resident of west Oxford in these circumstances .

894430:18	###Now both the West Oxfordshire District Council and the Chipping Norton Parish Council erm voted overwhelmingly against this proposed scheme , and the fact that they 've put these recommendations to the County Council erm can I ask the three County Councillors present erm it means nothing at all from your point of view ? ###Oh yes it does . 
894468:15	###mhm ###The Shilton dip is pretty horrifying . 
894537:167	###They 've done it very successfully in Cherwell , no cost to the ratepayer , no cost to the government , functioning perfectly well , no trouble to anybody because they 're all the same type of people . ###All they need is the planning permission and certainly the landowners will sell them the land , and if we put in stringent rules and regulations then we could control it properly . 
894620:13	###erm the first job is one of reassurance . ###Obviously , after a major international disturbance of this kind , people are concerned about the airways , and the reality of course is that it 's erm a damn sight more dangerous to cross the M forty than it is to cross the Atlantic .

894621:70	###Obviously , after a major international disturbance of this kind , people are concerned about the airways , and the reality of course is that it 's erm a damn sight more dangerous to cross the M forty than it is to cross the Atlantic . ###erm and we have to persuade people , really through the medium of , of P R ; through good editorials , through the world 's press and T V erm that it 's safe and then , through the medium of advertising - which is why we 've got a lot of extra money - we have to persuade the world that it 's affordable . 
894633:16	###erm and erm of course a lot of prime destinations are right on America 's doorstep . ###Apart from the fact that they have an enormous erm range of domestic attractions and destinations , everywhere from the Pacific north west to Florida and California , the Caribbean is on their doorstep , Hawaii is on their doorstep , Bermuda . 
894643:14	###We had Chernobyl , we had a series of hijackings , we had outrages at Athens Airport , we had the U S raid on Libya by bombers based in Britain erm and everybody then erm turned the corners of their mouths down and forecast the end of tourism , that doom is nigh , and what actually happened was that erm by the end of nineteen eighty six we were four point three per cent down in terms of numbers on a record nineteen eighty five . ###Now , we did n't have a recession in nineteen eighty six , but I would suggest that augers rather better than the mongers of gloom and doom would have us believe for nineteen ninety one . 
894701:73	###erm it 's difficult to say , but erm again that 's something they 're looking at over the next couple of weeks , but perhaps along last year 's lines - they should n't really be any higher than last year . ###And the other fear , of course , was that the cost of fuel is going to go out literally through the roof , if you 'll excuse the pun , erm that does n't seem to have happened , so again presumably they the tour operators will be able to hold prices , certainly as far as the flights are concerned ? 
894702:76	###And the other fear , of course , was that the cost of fuel is going to go out literally through the roof , if you 'll excuse the pun , erm that does n't seem to have happened , so again presumably they the tour operators will be able to hold prices , certainly as far as the flights are concerned ? ###They should be able to hold prices and they certainly should n't got up by as much as they thought they might have to put them up . 
894705:29	###Is there any sign that that actually is going to be reduced , the necessity for doing that ? ###Yes , there is . 
894726:81	###and a few million of them do . ###Every kind of holiday that there is - traditional beach holidays , action breaks , coach tours , boating trips , and more , plus attractions from mountain zoos to city museums , and a complete spectrum of quality accommodation from modern camping sites to luxury hotels .

894731:48	###It was actually launched yesterday . ###I think you were there with erm William Davis , who 's the Chairman of the English Tourist Board , so he was sort of launching this yesterday . 
894732:52	###I think you were there with erm William Davis , who 's the Chairman of the English Tourist Board , so he was sort of launching this yesterday . ###You were there , but now you and other representatives from the other local Tourist Boards have got to go out and spread the message . 
894739:81	###Now Michael Medleycote was rather upbeat . ###I mean he was saying look we 're going to go out and we 're going to market Britain to the overseas visitors and they do bring a lot of money into this country , but I mean are we really going to get back to the levels that we 've seen in recent years ? 
894750:117	###And it 's not just the businesses that are obviously involved with the tourist industry , because after all visitors do spend money . ###They go into the local shops . 
894757:52	###There 's an undeniable fact that that is so and that will obviously benefit the economy if they come and they will feel a draught if they do n't come . ###erm so they ca n't deny that . 
894846:174	###I 'm talking now as a consumer . ###It could be . 
894864:15	###The hotels , particularly in London , have found that their occupancy rates have dropped remarkably . ###Do you think that 's having an effect on the industry ? 
894893:66	###Exactly , and we are encouraged that more and more hoteliers are taking advantage of this particular scheme , because it is a good scheme . ###Take for instance Hartwell House in Aylesbury , erm a perfect example of a highly commended hotel , well worth it , and this is the type of standards that the Americans want . 
894895:26	###Now when you do this sort of assessment do you take into consideration the amount of money I have to pay to go and stay a night at a place like this ? ###Does that come into the classification ? 
894899:7	###He goes completely incognito . ###And that 's one of the factors . 
894900:7	###And that 's one of the factors . ###He has to pay that price . 
894940:48	###There are people in Oxford who 've never been to Windsor . ###Equally , there are people in Windsor who 've never been to Oxford . 
894964:169	###Well , I do n't imagine that you want me to answer all those questions immediately , otherwise nobody else , I think , would get a look in . ###So erm I imagine they 'll come up during the course of the programme . 
894983:10	###And I think we 've got to remember that a local authority is not funded from money that grows on trees , it is funded by the electorate and we , as Councillors , have a duty to that electorate to spend the money wisely . ###Well if the Conservatives got in would you cut back the money allocated to recreation and would you cut back on the recreation services ? 
894994:23	###Phyllis Starkey . ###Well , I mean I think that Queenie is trying to avoid the real question . 
894994:82	###Phyllis Starkey . ###Well , I mean I think that Queenie is trying to avoid the real question . 
895045:10	###We do feel that erm as a City Councillor we should be enabling people to find the homes of their choice . ###Michael Wright . 
895061:97	###Well , what does n't add up is the Government 's policy on housing . ###The Government has changed policy on housing to try to effectively force tenants out of council housing . 
895075:55	###I mean in fact when it 's sold to tenants it 's sold at erm a fraction of it 's real value . ###In any case , the logic of the government 's case is to say that if you are a person on low income , dependent on council housing , and you happen to live in area like Oxford , which has extremely high land values , then you should pay a very high rent , and they assume that they will pay that high rent and they reduce the grant to the housing fund erm on those lines , with the consequence that the Council had no choice but to put the rents up . 
895076:19	###In any case , the logic of the government 's case is to say that if you are a person on low income , dependent on council housing , and you happen to live in area like Oxford , which has extremely high land values , then you should pay a very high rent , and they assume that they will pay that high rent and they reduce the grant to the housing fund erm on those lines , with the consequence that the Council had no choice but to put the rents up . ###In fact initially the erm if we 'd followed Government guidelines exactly , the rents would have had to have gone up by even more , by about twelve pounds a week , but because erm we were able to erm manage the finances erm more carefully , we were able to reduce that increase to seven pounds a week , but none of the Labour Councillors would say that that increase is acceptable . 
895082:31	###Well , the point is erm Phyllis and her group knew very well that the Government had decreed the housing revenue account should balance . ###It had decreed that many years ago , and if they had taken the appropriate rent rises in steps and phased them in , this sudden large rise , which is causing hardship , would not have happened . 
895085:134	###At the actual erm meeting which put this into practice the Conservatives suggested a phased in method , some now and some later , and this would have relieved a certain amount of hardship . ###We know at the moment we 're under boundary changes . 
895101:167	###Which means that we talk to them about a reasonable rate at which they can pay their rent . ###We make sure that they have proper benefit advice , so that if there are any benefits that they 're entitled to that they get those benefits . 
895151:8	###Of course it is , sure . ###It is also subsidized by the City . 
895154:37	###What groups out of all those people working on the City Council , what people would you cut their jobs of ? ###Well , we 've got a problem on personnel and I think erm the Conservatives would certainly look at it if they got into control . 
895193:20	###erm when Queenie talks about the increase in number of people employed by the City Council you cannot deliver more services with fewer people . ###One of the biggest increases , of course , has occurred in the Treasurer 's Department with the advent of the Poll Tax . 
895194:7	###One of the biggest increases , of course , has occurred in the Treasurer 's Department with the advent of the Poll Tax . ###erm sixty eight extra staff we had to take on in order to implement the Poll Tax compared with the implementation of the rates . 
895198:9	###Queenie Warley . ###We agreed the sixty eight posts to start off the Poll Tax . 
895211:43	###Any organization which erm had a policy of employing consultants to carry out its core activities would be frankly mad , because consultants cost more than your own staff , always . ###You only use them when you have a special one off task and the City Council does use consultants where it is appropriate . 
895215:21	###We employ the people to do the jobs that need to be done within the Council . ###We look very carefully at any new posts that we create , and we constantly look to see whether there are posts that we can get rid of erm and we have , in fact , shed a great many posts erm over the last year erm and we are constantly reviewing the efficiency of our service delivery . 
895217:7	###But as well as cost , you must always look at quality . ###If we are to continue to deliver quality services , and indeed if we are to increase the quality , which is what we want to do , you cannot do that on a shoe string . 
895223:100	###Even the repairs ? ###Yes , repairs as well . 
895226:51	###erm and the amount of money that 's spent on twinning is in fact extremely small . ###erm I think that the amount is justified , erm I do n't think it would be justified to increase spending on twinning by any large amount . 
895308:29	###Good . ###that you have represented it out of all proportion to what it is , and you have frightened people unnecessarily . 
895311:38	###Queenie Warley , you want to come in there . ###In this instance , Bill , yes there is a problem . 
895315:142	###And there are places all over the City . ###The City is difficult , you can only shift this traffic management from one place to another and do the best you can in each area , and there are cheaper ways of doing it , not erm three hundred thousand at a time . 
895341:8	###That all costs money , and erm there are various ways we could suggest of raising that money , but that needs to be done . ###Once you 've done that , you can then start taking really strong action about keeping traffic out of the City , because you 've got the alternative . 
895345:7	###That is absolutely disastrous . ###We get the whole thing seized up for an hour and a half in the morning and an hour and a half in the evening . 
895379:12	###That is part of the balanced transport policy which was , I believe , brought out in about nineteen seventy three and has been reviewed erm all the time , all along . ###It is , of course , limiting congestion and growth and encouraging public transport and improving the environmental conditions generally on both main roads and residential streets . 
895407:277	###The whole idea of judging by one hundred days was resurrected in the Kennedy time and people applied that to Wilson and to Heath and to Margaret Thatcher , and maybe it 's just a media hype , but I think it does give us some view and I think we need more of a view on this man , because a lot of people are saying will the real John Major please stand up . ###Yes , as you rightly say , it 's not possible to judge anyone in erm a hundred days . 
895419:10	###It 's too early to say . ###I , with my knowledge of him before that in his previous offices , I would say that he was very much a man of substance . 
895433:50	###I think that erm certainly in the next erm in the immediate future I should be very surprised if we have another Margaret Thatcher . ###We may have another woman prime Minister , but not necessarily another Margaret Thatcher . 
895442:15	###Well , no , I think ###something more than just erm he 's picked the best people for the job . 
895488:137	###No , no , no , hold on . ###No , just wait a minute , no . 
895494:37	###How do you adjust for that ? ###is justified . 
895494:92	###How do you adjust for that ? ###is justified . 
895598:149	###Does one say yes Ma ' am , or ###No , no , you erm she 's a very friendly , kindly person , easy to talk to . 
895626:44	###Well most people would agree with that . ###Well all right . 
895651:42	###Yes . ###This is where you will see the erm substance of John Major . 
895683:55	###Ah , now we 're getting a little bit toward the meat here . ###Let 's go to Terry Clarke . 
895692:21	###okay , I take it back ###at that particular occasion . 
895737:17	###I understand that actually Mr Kinnock was n't being brief this time . ###In fact Mrs. Thatcher was the only one . 
895751:79	###Yes . ###Go ahead . 
895793:7	###Their erm this lovely word called breeding . ###Is it not 
895836:7	###Oh yes , I think one 's got ###And there seem to be a lot of those . 
895844:15	###Yes . ###Because he 's a caring man . 
895862:98	###Yes , but John Major has come in late . ###As Marianne said , we 've got we 've had the war . 
895876:32	###Marianne Talbot that 's quite unfair , I think . ###But we 've been asking during this programme will the real John Major please stand up . 
895888:11	###Ann , in the twenty one years of the women 's movement has there been any real progress for women ? ###Radio Oxford , Bill Heine Debate , Friday , 8 March 1991 , Tape 1 , Side B 
895913:10	###Right , under what department ? ###The Recreation Services . 
895916:33	###I work on the second floor . ###Mhm . 
895975:19	###Well women are getting short shrift . ###Yes , they are . 
895982:42	###We are trying to develop a day care policy in the County , which means that we would be able to make partnerships with erm firms working in the County . ###That 's not only in our own employment , but erm obviously in the commercial sector . 
896005:52	###I think men tend more to plan their career and to work out I want to become the director of the Bank of England , or whatever , and he will plan his career to get there . ###Well that 's because , perhaps because , when they were young children people directed them in that kind of decision making , or look people directed them to look at those sorts of levels . 
896040:53	###Things have changed for the wore in my view . ###That 's what you 've indicated , so how do people claw back the bad position that they were in before ? 
896052:32	###Define uppity . ###Uppity is when she no longer agrees with the man 's definition of her appropriate role within the family . 
896067:10	###Sorry , information was wrong there , but nevertheless you 're near the top of the tree in trying to help get more nursery places in the county and you know that you 're being you may have the best intentions , but you do n't have the facilities to do very much about it . ###Things are n't going to happen from the government so much . 
896074:17	###If you 're talking about non-government ways to do it , then I think that in any authority there are lot of voluntary organizations struggling to make provision of this kind . ###It 's increasingly difficult for the voluntary sector to make provision of this kind , to offer those opportunities without proper partnership with the state , so I do n't actually accept if you 're posing an alternative and saying that it 's either or , I do n't think that 's correct . 
896078:109	###One of the things we are doing during International Women 's Celebrations is we 're putting on a jobs and training opportunities fair , in Templar Square in the middle of Cowley Centre erm on the fifteenth of March between ten and four , so any women who want to know how they can get back to work , or what training opportunities there are available , are welcome to come . ###And also one of the things we have done is we 've booked this erm Just The Job Exhibition , which we brought down from Liverpool , and it 's got fifty life-size images of black and Asian women , with erm a little bit on their experiences at work , how they managed to find jobs , how they got started in their careers , and we felt that would be erm an inspiration to women coming into Cowley Centre . 
896111:18	###Yes , I think they tend to say they 're doing it for you . ###I mean they 're not doing their own housework or clearing up their own rubbish , they 're doing it for you . 
896145:16	###Well I think by men and women . ###I think I think it 's quite important that there is an equal partnership . 
896149:105	###I Brenda Thornton , do you think it 's that bleak ? ###Yes , I think I think it is . 
896152:41	###I think they 've got to become less competitive , less arrogant and less dominant , seeing that as the macho role , and I think they 've got to become erm much more erm feminine and approve the feminine characteristics , so that there is n't so much difference between the two genders , and particularly in marriage and in the home . ###Why do n't we change that ?

899387:28	###Military stores , every musketeer had to have at least two metres of match which was a fairly thick cord , which was used to ignite his musket , and if you start thinking about how many musketeers there were around in Oxford , a whole lot of match had to be stored . ###That 's quite combustible , sort of oiled cord . 
899389:207	###erm And there was , of course , powder had to be stored as well . ###And as well as that , beyond the city walls , fortifications were being erected all the way round the north of Oxford , the bits that were n't covered by the river . 
899397:42	###It is fairly easy to read , once you begin to get . ###Now , as well as the fortifications , I think one wants to erm very much keep in mind that the citizens of St Aldate 's were constantly being asked for money . 
899398:47	###Now , as well as the fortifications , I think one wants to erm very much keep in mind that the citizens of St Aldate 's were constantly being asked for money . ###There were these big loans for instance , $ 2,500 once the city had to make to the king . 
899400:22	###And this was collected by the parishes , and we know that St Aldate 's had to pay $ 280 , which along with All Saints , the city church , was the highest amount from all the various parishes . ###And then there was money for maimed soldiers , for what they called visited persons , which was the plague , fire and candles for the courts of guards , that was paying for fire and candles for all the little sentinel posts round Oxford .

899406:120	###They were supposed to raiding the city regiments and paying for it , there was constant trouble for this , and the man who was appointed colonel by the king , Nicholas Selby , was very unpopular . ###But I think the main thing that they all had to bear to survive , was a tremendous amount of overcrowding. erm Now , we 're fast running out of time , are n't we . 
899417:80	###Gentlemen and their men servants - 267 , these are the extra people staying in the houses , not the people who lived in St Aldate 's normally , women - 66 , children under 16 years of age - 13 , soldiers of the life-guards - 62 , total in this parish - 408 . ###So that 's 408 extra people living in St Aldate 's houses . 
899419:241	###Now , I think there 's probably a very nice parallel here , I ca n't help thinking it was probably a bit better , must have been better organised in the Second World War , but there 's going to be a erm special exhibition here is n't there , on memories of change on Oxford in the Second World War , and of course there were a great many extra people there too . ###And , because Edward Heath is so meticulous , we do know who were in all these different houses . 
899420:53	###And , because Edward Heath is so meticulous , we do know who were in all these different houses . ###erm I wo n't go through too many of them , erm but Blue Boar Inn , for instance , had 21 extra people , had some of the King 's servants , some of the prince 's servants , they had two Scottish peers , and their servants , $ 21 extra people , in a big inn , there were 14 rooms , I think , that were , could be called living rooms , but never-the-less , I think it must have been pretty crowded . 
899433:80	###$ And then in the tiny house lived a widow , Elizabeth Treadwell , with one sergeant and two other lifeguards , so she had 3 soldiers in that tiny house . ###So it 's erm there was in fact a great petition made to the king on these very lines , really because of the fire . 
899445:39	###I hope too that this beautiful countryside and this beautiful college will be conducive to good thoughts , reflections and reappraisals , and if I might say to the men I hope there are not too many of the female students floating up and down the corridors to further divert your attention . ###Of course at the moment environmental health is very much an in subject , especially with the Environmental Protection Act of 1990 , and your profession has the marvellous opportunity of seeking to safeguard the environment and also the threats that we have at the present time which are upon the environment , from so many sources but , most of all particularly in the eastern counties , from the population explosion , which we here in South Cambridgeshire know quite a bit about . 
899449:51	###We 're particularly proud of him in South Cambridgeshire , as we 're also proud that so many of our environmental health officers like Alan Hobson do sterling work for us , and we are looking to them in the in the future with this semi-autonomy that they 've been given to really take on board the opportunities which have been given to them under the 1990 Act to really go to town on environmental health . ###As we look around us , we see particularly in the field of litter that there is so much to do , and I 'm sure that this is one area where we shall be looking to improve our country and improve our countryside . 
899459:14	###And so you through this symposium today , particularly those of you who come from South Cambridgeshire , have an opportunity to learn , and we trust that through your learning you 'll be able to educate the media that we really do exist in South Cambridgeshire . ###And so I hope that , as you go away from this place , that you will really go away with the knowledge , and with the technical know-how , to put across the work which , as I said earlier , we all recognize is a very important part in these coming months and years . 
899565:10	###And then we 're also going to talk about practising , because it 's not a one-shot thing . ###If you produce a lovely little item which fits perfectly on a particular radio programme , or newspaper , and that happens to be the week that it 's the county show , or an earthquake , or something like that , there 's no way you 're going to get it in , because there 's too much competition , and the next week it 's dead . 
899571:105	###First of all , the great mistake most people when they 're talking to press people is to assume that they know what they 're talking about . ###Now I think half the problem is that most of the people working in the press are in fact amateurs in the sense they 're not specialists in your particular subject except perhaps in the trade press . 
899615:22	###So news interviews : listen to the question , answer the question , and stop talking . ###If I want more information , I 'll ask a supplementary . 
899691:52	###and not the back of the photograph , otherwise you 'll get yourself in all sorts of difficulties and it may make a nice editorial , nice letters to the editor , but it would be very irritating to to the editor , because they hate having mistakes pointed out to them , and that 's picture perspective . ###Very irritating to the mayor as well . 
899691:105	###and not the back of the photograph , otherwise you 'll get yourself in all sorts of difficulties and it may make a nice editorial , nice letters to the editor , but it would be very irritating to to the editor , because they hate having mistakes pointed out to them , and that 's picture perspective . ###Very irritating to the mayor as well . 
899692:66	###Very irritating to the mayor as well . ###Do n't forget that if you are going to quote other people at length , you have to check on whether you 're going to be in breach of copyright , you have to be careful how to quote things , and do n't forget that if you are actually quoting you need to give some indication of where the quotation comes from and make and check out that that 's all right , either by getting permission or , or actually giving , there 's a certain degree of flexibility . 
899735:239	###So there 's ambivalence towards you . ###And I just sort of wonder how we could possibly address some of that . 
899751:31	###And it seems to me that your problem is that , on the one hand you have a big and relatively easily you have you have you have a big job , but with big , but relatively defined , easily defined issues on your hands . ###We all get het up about health scares , salmonella , God knows what , and pollution and so on , and we all have views on things like Sunday trading or whatever and not that we all agree on any of these things . 
899771:15	###What I want , would like to see , and I think is in your interest and the public 's interest is actually to , to not just be responding but to be , to be reactive but to be pro-active , and to be going out onto the streets as it were . ###Now obviously that requires a more precise working knowledge of newspapers and the other media , what they want , when and how they need it , what the sort of particular publication is , you 've been discussing some of that and we can perhaps go into some of that in , in a bit more detail a bit later on .

899833:26	###Any queries contact Principal Food Officer , Peter Bray . ###Thank you very much .

899878:7	###It described how there had been a fifty percent increase in food poisoning cases in district year and then it went on to say that it , it was largely , it was thought that that increase was largely because of the increased publicity which the council had been given hygiene training , and saying how many people had been trained , and how the Health Committee was being asked to provide more resources so there could more courses even , even more courses in the following year . ###okay That 's , that 's a very nice outline .

899968:7	###Yes , but the pro-active , the good news often is not a good enough hook , I mean in my experience , the local media , they do want , the hook has to be , at least in the , in the initial phase has to be bad news . ###I do n't accept that , I really do n't accept that . 
900026:7	###It was a pretty ###With this business of embargo , Liz , I 'll agree with that but the , the off the record , one wants to get the local people very well and you do develop this , this trust , and if you can in fact give them a lot of scope that you know what to use . 
900029:8	###Yes . ###and in , in a limited way . 
900029:24	###Yes . ###and in , in a limited way .

900117:9	###This could actually , and probably was , be lifted entirely and published in its present form in most local freebies , local newspapers and so forth . ###It was an article all ready for lifting . 
900158:12	###It 's very easy to fall into well-used phrases and , and acronyms and bits of jargon . ###Do remember that the public may not have your abiding interest in environmental health . 
900166:7	###That is quite important , particularly if you are going to attribute quotes to people . ###It 's extremely unwise to quote your Chairman of Committee , if the Chairman of the committee actually A has n't been informed that he 's being quoted , or B has not actually agreed with what it is that you 're quoting . 
900299:78	###So , in my experience certainly down in the Sussex area , there 's , there 's great opportunity for people who have something worthwhile saying , who understand how to repackage what they 're saying in such a way that it will keep local radio audiences listening , and who are prepared to learn the minimum techniques and skills necessary to come across reasonably well . ###So local radio is a very good way of getting into it . 
900345:9	###So they potentially can be very interested in this . ###So you , what you 've got to do , is to think of ways in which you can translate the technicalities into simple language that other , that ordinary people can understand and appreciate what it is you 're doing and why it 's important . 
900361:7	###And if you can express what you 're doing in a way which catches their imagination , you 've got marvellous media material . ###Yes , but there are dangers in that . 
900428:15	###Well , I mean , obviously we 've , we 've played that totally for laughs . ###But 
900464:83	###The most important feature is that so far as human hearing 's concerned , each increase of ten decibels , the loudness of the sound doubles . ###So , the meter response to pressure change is just like a human ear ? 
900637:61	###No , no . ###Or perhaps not . 
900653:18	###clearly all those things are involved . ###No , no , I would n't , I would n't , I would n't agree there , because , because the institution may well have policy which is at variance with your council 's policy . 
900719:89	###Sounds , sounds all right . ###It 's explaining the system . 
900842:140	###Rome was , I suppose , the capital of the art world , but Rome was essentially an international place where many a Britisher was famous ; where Flaxman , for instance , had established himself as one of the most famous artists in the world . ###We hardly mention him nowadays . 
900863:27	###You see one can be both . ###What about the art public ? 
900878:25	###This actually reinforces what you 're saying I suppose . ###Yes , I think you would find that everywhere people will crowd into especially post-impressionism , which is Van Gogh , etc. , more than they would into an avant-garde exhibition . 
900912:99	###Briefly , no . ###I 've tried it sometimes , never long enough to know whether I did it successfully or not , but I found there is absolutely no way of telling because even if it changes in a way one can predict , what one can predict is the way oneself changes or the world changes at the same time . 
900919:101	###FOX Report ; 22/Feb/90 ###Tonight , three people are found dead at a house in Buckinghamshire . 
900932:112	###Neil Kinnock agrees ; he says high mortgage rates and the poll tax are bound to push up inflation rates even more . ###But Mrs Thatcher has told him in the Commons the Government 's not to blame : 
900942:15	###His trial begins on March the 5th . ###Nick Peters , I R N Washington . 
900963:15	###The hospital has overspent its budget for this financial year by $ 70,000 . ###It means it will be no treatment for 150 routine patients over the last 5 weeks , and that starts on Monday . 
900965:20	###Last August the hospital had to close 26 beds because it could n't afford to staff them . ###Horton General Manager , Denis Baston , admits he 's again facing an embarrassing situation . 
900966:163	###Horton General Manager , Denis Baston , admits he 's again facing an embarrassing situation . ###We 're very sorry to have to curtail our services er in this way . 
900975:41	###er Well it 's very easy to er blame government for not allocating resources , er but er the pure fact is that the health authority has insufficient resources to allocate to us to meet the increasing demands of this area . ###Is there any guarantee that this situation might not be repeated er a year from hence ? 
901015:150	###It follows a ruling in the High Court that the government 's guidance to officers that operate it is too strict , limiting awards of grants and loans to poor people . ###But Mr Raisin says he doubts the Labour Party 's criticism that the budget itself is too small . 
901065:19	###Well at the moment , the Harwell laboratories are having their exemption from Nuclear Survey at 1965 removed . ###Er . 
901078:161	###So , do you see as the real reason for the shut-down of Dido and Pluto really a win for the arguments long standing of the environmental lobby . ###er Not exactly of the environmental lobby . 
901091:8	###Some of the councils who have set the poll tax budgets in relation to the government 's community charge is far in excess of their estimation , and you know it 's absolutely ridiculous . ###I do n't know how working class people can manage to survive . 
901138:15	###It means it will be no treatment for 150 routine patients over the next 5 weeks . ###That 's starting on Monday . 
901139:19	###That 's starting on Monday . ###Last August the hospital had to close 26 beds because it could n't afford to staff them . 
901154:59	###To do A-Level Business Studies can take a year quite easily for even the averagely competent student . ###And yet it is the same level at the end . 
901156:12	###This would suggest that Business Studies , along with other subjects such as perhaps Sociology and History , perhaps have to be re-evaluated , compared to other subjects such as Maths and Physics and Chemistry . ###Would you say that the current system is perhaps unfair , and that it should be reviewed quite urgently ? 
901176:11	###As it is because I have always practised ordinary , normal methods of hygiene , I feel that er fresh food well cooked is not a danger to anybody . ###But if it had been irradiated , well , let us put it this way , I would n't buy food if I knew it was irradiated . 
901255:14	###There 's no records actually published of the actual aircraft used . ###There was a missing aircraft report issued , I think about 8 days after he actually went down . 
901303:37	###The fish course is Dover Sole , souffle with Morel mushroom on an orange , er the meat course is a trilogy of meat , which is beef lamb and veal , with a port sauce , and the sweet is a citrus terrine , with a mint cream sauce . ###Have you practised this er menu ? 
901359:64	###The document which has been leaked says they did n't spot the danger in time , and the noise from the disco on the Marchioness prevented the alarm being raised . ###It also says three earlier accidents had been largely ignored because there had been no fatalities . 
901369:10	###Clearly I 'm gratified that the Appeal Court has cleared my name . ###I have lived through a long nightmare and am shattered by what was done to me . 
901413:20	###The reunification of Germany looks set to happen before the year is out after the Conservative Alliance victory . ###East Germany 's entry to the Common Market looks a little less certain . 
901426:11	###And it will choose to be a member of NATO . ###That 's one of the very important advantages of this election result , and personally I think the Social Democrats in Germany made a great mistake by being equivocal on this issue .

901577:146	###Gary O' Donaghue who 's a blind student preparing to finish his final year at Christ Church in Oxford says the government 's plan will cause havoc if it 's given the go-ahead . ###It looks like that not really a great deal of account has been taken of the extra costs that are incurred by visually handicapped people in courses of study , such as paying for er expensive , extremely expensive , computing equipment which is n't a luxury , it 's a necessity quite often for many people , especially doing science courses . 
901588:33	###Er . ###I do n't know whether that is widely understood but I think it 's quite and important feature of our proposals . 
901590:92	###Nevertheless it is still a loan that of course has to be repaid . ###Is it perhaps not more difficult for a disabled student even with a degree to get employment in order to be able to repay that loan ? 
901677:228	###Human nature is the same . ###Human beings have certain needs , certain problems , and I think that all religions in their own way have found ways of coping with those problems as different languages may differ grammatically , and they 're all trying to help people do the same thing . 
901689:9	###But nothing , I did n't do anything different really , it was n't anything exceptional really , it 's just I think people really want to er be treated properly and er and then get the service that they 're looking for , basically speaking that 's right . ###So what was involved ? 
901689:29	###But nothing , I did n't do anything different really , it was n't anything exceptional really , it 's just I think people really want to er be treated properly and er and then get the service that they 're looking for , basically speaking that 's right . ###So what was involved ? 
901696:9	###So , do you treat her differently ? ###Oh , ah , that 's the problem see , yeah , she thinks that I charm people down here and er leave it all down the station . 
901711:47	###Well , I would suppose that the person they 're looking for is similar in character , but if they 're going to er if they 're looking for that person I think they 've just got to act normally , and it 's not a one-off thing , I think it 's built up over the years . ###And that was the Fox Report for Monday the 19th of March 1990 . 
901765:82	###150 went on Friday . ###Is it with any sadness that Culham and Harwell have seen these people go ? 
901794:131	###Did you try out more walks than you eventually used ? ###er Only a couple . 
901814:7	###Yes , I 'm very impressed ' cos these things always get rather fraught nearer the end . ###Ah yes , this one 's been , we 've all been very organised on this , you know , so it 's been better than most , but , ' cos er you were , er you 've seen it and your listeners who 've seen it will know it 's a very complex play , so it 's made us get more disciplined to start with . 
901831:50	###Are you er convinced that you 're going to make it ? ###I 'm absolutely positive I 'm going to make it . 
901955:101	###This is Joanne Zorin , A A Roadwatch . ###British rail tell us that the Scotland to Brighton train which is due to call at Oxford at 5.35 is running 2 hours late this evening , but I have nothing to report to you from the buses . 
902013:42	###They 've something to hide which is why they wo n't turn up and indeed they did submit , they have submitted er as a mission to the structure plan ; try to get the County Council on their side . ###The structure plan is essentially about where jobs and housing should be , not what sort of jobs and housing , and they 've made this submission to the structure plan . 
902017:173	###Now there are 3 days of the Enquiry , what do you think will come out of ? ###Well , one thing I think will come out of it is that the Enquiry will say that this closure will have fairly cataclysmic affects on the economy of this city , I think that 's clear , and I think that will come out of it . 
902017:210	###Now there are 3 days of the Enquiry , what do you think will come out of ? ###Well , one thing I think will come out of it is that the Enquiry will say that this closure will have fairly cataclysmic affects on the economy of this city , I think that 's clear , and I think that will come out of it .

902063:44	###Now there are other issues involved in this elections . ###er if they do n't give you what you consider to be the right answer to those questions , are you saying that you should totally disregard the other issues that are 
902065:68	###Well no , voting is when somebody goes to the polling booth they have to weigh all the pro 's and cons of all the information that they 've been told . ###We 're asking that you test the temperature of your politicians that offer themselves up to stand on the councils , and we believe that being a good environmentalist aids all of their political life and er saving the environment now will save money in the future . 
902072:9	###er how the candidates feel really about environmental issues , there 's a lot of lip service paid to environmentalism er popping green petrol in your car is not the way to save the planet , it helps but it 's not the only answer . ###There are a lot of ways . 
902241:44	###Many British managers are workaholics . ###A nationwide study has revealed that the managers surveyed are of those Managers nearly 80 % do n't take the holiday their entitled to . 
902369:99	###Yesterday Virgin 's Gatwick-based 747 , the Scarlet Lady the flagship of their fleet , left Britain with 30 tons of medical and food supplies for refugees on the Jordanian-Iraqi border . ###The plan left Amman , Jordan 's capital , just after midnight and landed at Gatwick shortly before eight this morning ; on board 57 Britons , 29 Americans , 4 Australians and 2 Canadians . 
902372:9	###Well we travelled through the night mostly , we got to erm no we got to no-man 's land that 's when it got bad . ###It was really hot and dusty . 
902378:38	###The man who flew the hostages out , Virgin Chairman Richard Branson spoke of the human misery at the airport . ###Just ten minutes from the airport you 've got erm thousands and thousands of Bangladeshis wanting to get home er and it 's embarrassing I find , being erm and the press find , being er at the airport er seeing all the attention on a few you know , western faces . 
902439:75	###Defence correspondent Paul Maurice asked her just how much of the threat to Britain had increased since the start of the Gulf crisis . ###I would say it 's gone up 100 per cent , where before there was a logical argument to say that it 's negligible , that argument no longer exists ; it is not negligible , it is there , it is upon us now , and it is likely to er lead to considerable er hazard for our civilian population and civilian populations of all NATO countries if we do not address it . 
902465:150	###The core issue really is the control of natural resources and as the resources become scarcer , then there 's a greater possibility for conflict . ###We use oil in so many different ways in our lives that our lives are going to be affected by any crisis in the area where the oil is produced . 
902469:54	###Well , we 're anxious that there is n't an escalation of this crisis , that it may be dealed with as Brigadier Harbottle has written in a letter to the Guardian today , dealt with , er more through first of all an attempt by the Arab nations to come to some agreement amongst themselves and agreement which will satisfy them and be a more long-lasting one . ###Er . 
902480:9	###We estimate that er of the er the current level of collected dose from medical radiology , about half of it could in fact be reduced by implementing the recommendations of the report . ###In half the cases examinations could have been carried out using less radiation . 
902484:22	###Well certainly examinations should only be carried out where er there is a benefit likely to accrue to the patient , and er this should always be greater than the risk from the radiation itself . ###Now we find in fact for the levels radiation that used , the risks to the individual patients are very very low indeed er generally less than one in a thousand chance of some adverse effect . 
902553:42	###But then how can you say it 's safe if they 're not regularly tested ? ###We do need , this is a fair point , that we do need more data all the way through here , at the moment none of us is suggesting any compulsory tests for anybody . 
902587:31	###Your plans to hold this demonstration of public affection between homosexual couples have already drawn criticism . ###Is this really going to advance your cause ? 
902589:12	###Well I think the first thing is , we have to bring out into the open the way in which the law is being misused . ###You see , none of these laws actually mention homosexuality at all ; they 're all interpreted by the police and the courts to criminalise our affection . 
902707:176	###The incident happened between 1.30 and 2.40 on Saturday afternoon ; police want to speak to a young man seen on a pedal cycle in the area at the time . ###P C Mike Patching crime intelligence officer at Banbury and head of the crime stoppers organization in the town , says it was a despicable crime . 
902733:47	###But they won a fair fight and they took a tremendous lot of trouble and they really did a very good campaign , there 's no question about that at all . ###The disappointment in the Athens camp has bordered on bitterness and I asked the mayor of Atlanta , Maynard Jackson for his reaction to the words of one Athens delegate who described the Atlanta decision as a win for Coca Cola and a loss for the Olympic ideal . 
902764:149	###I might just add that what we are deeply disturbed by , is that as the fighting continues in Cambodia with Phol Pot trying once again to get into control , already a hundred and fifty thousand people have been displaced by that fighting and that er the number of amputees has reached something like a thousand a month which is twice last year 's figure . ###You yourself have visited the camps out there , and what are these people going through ? 
902775:53	###But the police have announced that they are n't bringing criminal charges against er seventeen adults that were arrested in connection with these allegations . ###Should n't the children be allowed to go home ? 
902776:32	###Should n't the children be allowed to go home ? ###It 's a very important distinction and one that is n't properly understood : the police have to have clear concrete evidence on an offence . 
902791:36	###It 's at this point that AIDS develops . ###This new virus now might have been mutated in such a way that the er antibodies which are present at , at the moment , are not able to recognize and destroy this new virus . 
902795:16	###The problem with the AIDS vaccine might be that if you have a vaccine which would be able to suppress a particular virus strain er which would induce immunity against a particular virus strain , then necessarily you do not have a vaccine which can provide immunity against another virus strain . ###Is there a chance if it changes so rapidly , that there could never be a vaccine for the whole strain , for the whole H I V virus . 
902808:92	###No , it 's not the case , they are X-ray images that we are looking at and it means that we can have er real time conversation with the doctors at the other end to advise whether the patient should be transferred to us or stay within the , in the hospital where they are , er whatever 's best at the time . ###I suppose in the past , this sort of consultation was done just verbally on the telephone was it ? 
902842:116	###Their instructors will be the real experts at the police driving school ; it 's part of a pilot scheme and if it 's successful it could be extended throughout the area , and it 's free . ###At the moment most drivers have no official training on how to cope with motorway conditions , I asked Sergeant Bill Clarke from the Forces Driving School why it was n't part of the driving test . 
902869:81	###We 're very pleased , we put in about 18 months really hard work on this , we 've er done our development funding , we 've put in our plan which is said to be one of the best plans in the country , we worked very hard , we 're very pleased . ###$ 7 million is not to be sniffed at , what 's that going to be spent on ? 
902913:11	###Monetarily , I have n't any idea what it 's worth , er it 's not everybody 's cup of tea , it is a cockfighting chair , but it 's very very interesting . ###And an Oxford University academic says no to admitting students on sports ability alone . 
902961:15	###It 's the first sign the Chancellor 's squeeze is actually having the desired effect , not just on industry , but on the country 's Achilles heel , and brings nearer the day when the Chancellor can cut interest rates , but probably not before Christmas . ###Shadow Chancellor , John Smith says that 's both stubborn and short-sighted . 
902967:126	###Liberal Democrat leader , Paddy Ashdown says the improved trade figures mean Britain should now join Europe 's exchange rate mechanism as soon as possible . ###He says Chancellor John Major should ignore Mrs Thatcher 's prejudices . 
902968:35	###He says Chancellor John Major should ignore Mrs Thatcher 's prejudices . ###The battle between the Prime Minister , the split indeed between the Prime Minister and the Chancellor which is a re-run of the appalling split between her and Nigel Lawson which is the origins of our present problem , is something that must be brought under control . 
902990:77	###Right , so it 's er basically businesses are n't doing as well ? ###Businesses are n't doing as well no , that , that 's the definition . 
903065:73	###Er . ###We believe it 's high time that both er prison staff and prisoners were able er to seek er an independent outside view , er whenever there are difficulties . 
903083:21	###They 've taken three oil paintings ; two off the walls and one which was leaning up against the window sill , er the candlesticks and the vases off the altar , another very beautiful , very simple oak chair with cane seat and back . ###Have you any idea what sort of people could have taken this and when it could have happened ? 
903084:29	###Have you any idea what sort of people could have taken this and when it could have happened ? ###Well we know that it must have happened overnight , er we were open until six o' clock on Thursday evening . 
903086:15	###Everything was checked and locked up and it must have gone during the late night or early morning , Thursday night/Friday morning . ###Do you suppose this is the work of antiques experts ? 
903089:43	###But it does make one very depressed er that people can vandalise and er infiltrate er a sacred place and take all sorts of things which quite honestly are not of a great deal of value to anybody else . ###Do you intend to keep the Manor and the chapel open ? 
903089:153	###But it does make one very depressed er that people can vandalise and er infiltrate er a sacred place and take all sorts of things which quite honestly are not of a great deal of value to anybody else . ###Do you intend to keep the Manor and the chapel open ?

903124:10	###Of course it will be difficult because at the moment the er the legal minimum is thirty miles an hour in , in any city , but we 'd like to see Oxford as a pilot for a twenty mile an hour speed limit which is no good if you leave the roads as they are . ###But if you widen the pavements and you differentiate the pavements from the roadway , and you use continental traffic calming measures which are not great big humps but which are perhaps little stretches of cobbles and things like that , then you should be able to bring the speed down to twenty miles an hour . 
903149:75	###Still to come : two students from the Eastern Bloc start courses at Oxford Poly today as part of the new scholarship scheme . ###First though , a severely disabled woman from Oxford says every time she travels by train , she 's put in the guard 's van . 
903151:12	###Sylvia Pedder from Headington in Oxford uses a wheelchair and despite efforts by British Rail to update their trains , she says often she has to travel for hours on end on her own . ###Phil Kirby reports : 
903156:97	###I 'm put in the guard 's van and sometimes the guard does n't even come to see if I 'm alright . ###She 's written to her M P , Andrew Smith , and at the start of this year , British Rail allowed her into the buffet car . 
903161:124	###We 're about half way through the process at the moment , and as of today , it does depend which train she travelled on from Oxford as to whether it 's actually been converted with the disabled accommodation or whether er it 's not yet provided . ###But the problem still exists and Sylvia 's carer , Barbara Waddington says she believes with so few trains apparently unable to fit the wheelchair on to the train , British Rail ought to ensure that Sylvia can travel in more comfort . 
903161:136	###We 're about half way through the process at the moment , and as of today , it does depend which train she travelled on from Oxford as to whether it 's actually been converted with the disabled accommodation or whether er it 's not yet provided . ###But the problem still exists and Sylvia 's carer , Barbara Waddington says she believes with so few trains apparently unable to fit the wheelchair on to the train , British Rail ought to ensure that Sylvia can travel in more comfort .

903881:48	###The way forward , if it 's the desire of the community to find more low cost houses for people to live in , in villages , I think the way is to give some incentive to farmers and landowners to give er or to make land available . ###And as there is n't the money available to do it at full commercial price , in my view we should go for what they call cross-subsidy , that is to say that they give erm planning permission on a plot for some commercial housing on which the landowner can make some money , and in , a condition of that would be that part of that plot would be made available for low cost housing .

904191:46	###The atmosphere with the actual returnees themselves is one of concern and apprehension I guess , because they 're concerned that they 've been involved in this , this crisis and they 're not quite sure what 's happening , and they are er not really being told by everybody , you know , there 's just too many people to make it very clear where they 're all going and when they 're all going . ###And therefore most people are , are , are so , you know , concerned about their , their particular out , you know , what 's going to happen , are , does their government know that they are there ? er What 's going to happen when they get back into India , Sri Lanka , Bangladesh , Philippines or , or Pakistan or wherever .

905601:67	###And as usual we believe that the Council can deliver its services in a different way , that is by pushing local financial management for schools , competitive tendering in the - there are savings in administration there . ###And in that figure I 've just given you we have allowed for extra provision in some cases like for the national curriculum in the education sector , additional spending for under fives and taking on board the requirements in Social Services for care in the community and the children 's bill , although those have been , of course - the care in the community proposals have now been delayed and they are being phased in over three years .

905748:61	###We all want basic comforts , but there are intelligent ways of producing these comforts and intelligent limits to impose on oneself in order not to foul the nest for everybody else . ###How do you solve the poverty cycle of the developing world ? 
905750:28	###The multi-national corporations , the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund are prolonging the process still today , and individuals have to , I believe , look at their own patterns of consumption and look at the way society in general works and work towards reducing levels of consumption in the rich countries so that we are more able to help the poor countries help themselves . ###When you say consumption , are you talking about absolutely everything that we have in our homes and eat and

905830:46	###The pressure - it 'll be off them , they are no longer champions - but let 's remember they did finish in fourth place and I 've got a feeling that they 're not giving anything away at Oxford Speedway , because they never do . ###There 's going to be a few new faces next term . 
905834:49	###It was n't , it was n't a bad end to the season after the way thing seemed to be going in the middle , but what do you reckon - are you going to predict that Hans Nielsen will be world champion again next year ? ###I think so .

905874:21	###The deputy editor of Which , Judith Gubby , although she 's not a banger fan herself , munched her way through two dozen different varieties , says you 'd be amazed at what 's inside . ###Quite a lot of them did n't have all that much meat in them , which is not surprising , because they do n't actually have to have all that much meat , which we thought was quite amazing . 
905882:40	###Nearly every sausage , I mean there are odd exceptions , are made from ends . ###So , as far as our saussies go , two things are clear .

906025:38	###As Foreign Secretary , after this news do you still feel Mrs. Thatcher 's stand is the correct one ? ###Well the policy is not Mrs. Thatcher 's policy , it 's the policy on which we are all agreed on and which Geoffrey Howe helped to main . 
906027:20	###Everybody has their own style and tone , and we do n't all have to be clones one and another . ###She has her own tone and style and I 've seen it very effective . 
906028:40	###She has her own tone and style and I 've seen it very effective . ###Do you feel you will have to mend fences now ? 
906029:23	###Do you feel you will have to mend fences now ? ###Well , there will be a certain amount of explanation that will have to be done , because Geoffrey Howe is a well known , well liked figure among many people that I deal with er but now , and for some time now , for a year now , it 's I who have been dealing with them and I hope I 've inherited some of the work and some of the trust which he helped to create . 
906055:78	###A team of six inspectors compiled the reports from visits to homes over last three months , and from almost a thousand questionnaires . ###The study 's thought to be the first of its kind in Britain and shows a generally positive response to conditions in the county 's fifteen council run homes .

906138:78	###We tried for compensation and we 've got Tony Baldry , who we 're going to see Saturday , and he 's going to try and claim for us under the Criminal Injuries Compensation Act . ###So why have n't you had any so far ? 
906140:58	###Our solicitor is fighting for that , but we seem as though we 're up against a brick wall at the moment , so we 'll have to just wait and see . ###But just as satisfying as compensation for Mrs. Morley would be a change in the law . 
906141:19	###But just as satisfying as compensation for Mrs. Morley would be a change in the law . ###At the moment , even children under fourteen can use airguns on private land , though youngsters under seventeen must be accompanied by an adult on public land . 
906165:7	###They get typically twice or two and a half times the salaries that our people get and that 's being going on for a very long time . ###In fact the members took it to a European court and spent a lot of their own money - twenty five thousand pounds - to try and get a discrimination judgement out of the European court , which failed at the last hurdle really , we think on political grounds really . 
906247:21	###What about the local sports scene this weekend Mickey . ###Well rugby dominates . 
906287:12	###They 're gonna beat Walsall , and tomorrow they 're going to beat Bognor , because I do n't like the name of their club . ###In division two , South Abingdon Town - they 're doing absolutely superbly , Jane , they 're at Malden Vale . 
906297:39	###Thank you very much , Mickey . ###You 're listening to the Fox Report . 
906358:41	###So they 're very confident . ###What I 've told the players is we 've got to go up and play as well as we can to beat a team like Blackburn . 
906388:7	###Phil Angell asked him what does it take to risk life and limb . ###There are three aspects which would make a world class bobsleigher . 
906389:8	###There are three aspects which would make a world class bobsleigher . ###You have to have a very experienced driver . 
906389:34	###There are three aspects which would make a world class bobsleigher . ###You have to have a very experienced driver . 
906416:7	###You 'll get there in no time in that . ###I do n't go to Brighton on it . 
906419:7	###Nineteen oh four cars can go , but nothing later . ###The other car , the other De Dion we had , burst its radiator , but we are very resourceful ; we went and bought thirty foot of garden hose and connected it to the engine and sent the water round and round the car and that acted as a radiator , and we drove it for a week like that . 
906459:38	###What it really does - let 's not get too involved in the equipment - it gives people a flavour of what skiing 's about . ###Of course , we ca n't have the mountains , but our enthusiasm and we 'll help you experience it . 
906464:13	###Yes , it 's open to everyone and we have a full range of experts there - people from the equipment companies , from Touchwood Sports , tour operators , the Ski Club will be there as well and we 'll be there to explain what skiing is , how you can start , how you learn to ski on the dry ski slope with the Ski Club , how you can go on alpine holidays , evening events , everything . ###And when does it all start ? 
906511:7	###Tonight , the Chancellor tells the House of Commons that interest rates wo n't be tumbling further . ###Fox Report , Fox F M , 15 October 1990 , 6.00pm 
906544:181	###Staff at St Heliers in Carshalton say doors were left unlocked for up to ten minutes so an emergency patient could be admitted . ###But Union officials have described security as sloppy . 
906556:25	###And just in case anyone was celebrating too much , Mr Major warned : ###Membership of the Exchange Rate Mechanism will be an additional discipline for the United Kingdom economy ; in no sense is it a soft option . 
906564:59	###The Prime Minister has been challenged by Neil Kinnock to debate the issue . ###She has refused , which led Mr Smith to ask : 
906625:68	###Er . ###But there 's a big difference in my view between the sort of regular abuse and assaults on staff in a Casualty Department and somebody walking into what should have been a locked ward on a children 's unit in a hospital at two o' clock in the morning . 
906630:164	###Hospital officials at the John Radcliffe are to introduce a new card system whereby all staff will carry identification . ###Services and Development Manager at the J R , Richard Sunley , says while there 's no guarantee an incident of the kind that occurred in Carshalton wo n't happen in Oxford , he believes the new security system will play a significant role . 
906646:41	###Robin Gorner is er AIDS Liaison Officer with Oxford City Council . ###Robin , this on the face of it looks very worrying , what 's your reaction to these statistics ? 
906647:162	###Robin , this on the face of it looks very worrying , what 's your reaction to these statistics ? ###Well clearly it 's devastating news ; er unfortunately I think we have to say that we 're not tremendously surprised . 
906650:17	###I think what it clearly shows is that health education messages are n't getting through to heterosexuals . ###In the reports it showed that only forty per cent of gay men were becoming infected , whereas ninety five per cent increase in heterosexuals , that 's very worrying . 
906678:98	###In that case , Mrs Cole-King would be able to act as a priest in Dorchester Abbey without having to be ordained again . ###It is an ambition of hers , but she reckons there 's still a long way to go . 
906682:77	###There is still quite a lot of opposition , so I do n't think it 's , it 's a certainty , but I would certainly very much hope and believe that this is the will of God for the Church and that , that it will happen . ###The Department of the Environment has given the go ahead for Oxfordshire 's plans for extracting minerals until the turn of the century . 
906691:80	###Not specifically , er you , you 're right , we 've got a planning application in for Finmere , er and the Council will be considering that probably , next month . ###Er . 
906695:33	###In the long term , yes , but what we 're currently doing as part of the assessment of the Finmere application is just checking the resources that do exist in those four areas , to , to make sure that we 're still able to meet our targets . ###And if you do n't get that amount , presumably Finmere comes back into the picture again ? 
906744:92	###He 's coping very well , he knows that we are with him all the way , and he knows that we love him , and he 's worried about the children and myself , but he was coping very well . ###He had a lot of worries because my daughter has been very very ill , and er he was really worried about my daughter , but otherwise he was okay . 
906774:38	###The London stockmarket was very much in recovery mood advancing throughout the morning , at one stage it was up twenty five points . ###A bright start on Wall Street due to reduced Gulf worries and falling , falling oil prices , encouraged London . 
906798:39	###Right , well tonight at the Manor - Oxford under fifteens are facing their Reading ca n't , counterparts in the second round of the English Schools Football Association Cup . ###Manager of the Oxford side is Hugh Jennings , who has high hopes his side can emulate past exploits of the Oxford youngsters . 
906809:87	###I think he 's gone up north . ###Yes fine . 
906814:190	###Is that definite ? ###That 's definite yes . 
906853:154	###She took her Great Dane puppy for a walk for the first time , when I say she was a puppy , she was huge . ###She took her to , to the Sands and let her off the lead and she went bounding off , and she looked even funnier actually because she , er Doreen the owner had three little Yorkshire Terriers who made Penny look even more huge . 
906858:45	###Mm , because you , you erm have er the , obviously that you could be sent some dubious tapes ? ###Yes , we have , I mean other types of , of clips that we would n't show for different reasons , for instance we , we got one last week where a chap was decorating his lounge and he 'd locked the camera off on himself , but he had no clothes on , nothing funny happened , he was just decorating with no clothes on . 
906895:36	###He arrived before them to coordinate their integration into the first U S Marine expeditionary force ; he says the first task for his men will be acclimatisation with desert temperatures still in the high nineties . ###We 're all ready for them to go . 
906928:133	###But you can imagine running your household on that kind of a system , supposing you got the whole food basket , and supposing it was adequate , could you make your children eat the same thing day after day , after day after day . ###Of course , you could n't , but poor little severely malnourished children are often given a , a kind of gruel which might be healthy , but to get them to eat it is very difficult , so kids , lots of things happen and . 
907015:100	###We took advantage of the excellent opportunity of monetary conditions coming within their limits to end all the speculation about when we should go in , and go in . ###Mr Kinnock attacked again . 
907017:15	###He was n't er able to be so positive as that , but he did certainly give us the impression that er that he 'd listened very carefully to what we had to say . ###I think there were one or two er new items of information that he had concerning Oxfordshire which he did n't realise before , and he certainly gave us the impression that he would er , er take these into account when assessing the share out to Oxfordshire . 
907050:132	###I 'm very hopeful because er , Vietnam since nineteen eighty six has been under a process of economic and political reform , and they have released er a large amount of prisoners over this time , and there are still a number of prisoners , such as poets er religious people that are still in prison , who are hoping that , with their renewed effort and attention from the media , this 'll er be changed . ###You say you do n't know what he was convicted of ; do you have any clues as to the sort of thing that it 's likely to have been ? 
907097:138	###Er . ###But also to make people aware of the Chest , Heart and Stroke Association , what we 're trying to do , and that we 're there to help people as well as being er an organisation which just hands out money to er doctors . 
907097:162	###Er . ###But also to make people aware of the Chest , Heart and Stroke Association , what we 're trying to do , and that we 're there to help people as well as being er an organisation which just hands out money to er doctors . 
907106:17	###And that 's mid November ? ###That 's mid November , yes . 
907119:97	###Another er important point is that now we can make use of text books that were not available in the past , we got a lot of help from er West German publishing houses , because they provided East German English teachers with er text books , with cassettes and other teaching material , er and that will help to improve the whole teaching situation in that part of Germany . ###Do you think that education will suffer , what was East Germany . 
907119:119	###Another er important point is that now we can make use of text books that were not available in the past , we got a lot of help from er West German publishing houses , because they provided East German English teachers with er text books , with cassettes and other teaching material , er and that will help to improve the whole teaching situation in that part of Germany . ###Do you think that education will suffer , what was East Germany . 
907139:150	###Now I ca n't remember which English player it was , either Bobby Moore or Norman Hunter , I think it was Norman Hunter because he played for Leeds , but they made a mistake and they scored a breakaway goal . ###But they had this goalkeeper , do you remember him , his name was Thomasescu , he was about ten foot two , eyes of blue , and he stopped everything , Kevin Hector had a go , Alan Clarke , they all did , even Peter Shilton in goal . 
907148:90	###Okay , what about the Oxford pair Jim Magilton and Paul Kee , are they going to be playing for Northern Ireland ? ###Well I 've tried to ring Billy Bingham their manager today , but he ca n't make up his mind , he , he , apparently he 's going to name his side tomorrow . 
907149:15	###Well I 've tried to ring Billy Bingham their manager today , but he ca n't make up his mind , he , he , apparently he 's going to name his side tomorrow . ###I do n't think Paul Kee will play , and to be perfectly honest , I do n't think Jim Magilton will play , but we 're going to have to wait until tomorrow ; Billy Bingham just ca n't make up his mind . 
907169:50	###Well there you go Mickey , did you have any money on this one - I bet you did n't after what you said last night ? ###Well no , no , I did n't fancy him yesterday , he was a bit rusty , he needed a day to get back into form , but two winners ; lets mention the other one , that one in the Biddistone all age stakes , Nicholas was there , six to four on , trained by his good lady and half and hour later , in the four o' clock , finish , Shining Jewel , romped home at eleven to one in the Gainsborough Claiming Stakes , a division two race for three year olds .

907200:75	###From Cambridge it is , yes , er that 's actually one of its great strengths , because it is n't a thing which has been revised and added on to , it is completely new , and before we actually made it , our editor , David Crystal , er actually is probably the only person in the world to have sat and read through from cover to cover four other encyclopaedias , to find out what was wrong with them , how they could be improved . ###And having done that daunting task , he then attempted the even more daunting task of putting all this information together into this enormous book , and it is , as you see before you , a very hefty tome . 
907334:7	###Others are wary , like this East German border guard responsible for the bunker . ###I think it should be left as it is , but this is a matter for the historians . 
907345:27	###Filled for the first time in twenty years , Lake Eyre became a rich source of food , attracting tens of thousands of birds whose closest usual breeding area is five hundred miles to the south . ###But now the water 's evaporating , killing the tiny fish that brought the birds here in the first place , and as the food source disappears , many birds are dying . 
907354:35	###For astronomers around the world , it was the moment of the century . ###It may have been seven years late and a billion dollars over budget , but the Hubble space telescope was lifting out of the shuttle cargo bay and on its way to orbit at last , ready to look back across the universe to the very beginnings of time . 
907445:102	###English teacher Natasha Kopilov , her husband Misha and fifteen year old son Yuri , leave for Israel next month . ###Defending a Jewish school friend has taught Yuri all about anti-semitism . 
907625:49	###Nonetheless , the opposition 's most prominent figures were banned for standing . ###Aun San Suu Kiy the popular leader of the National League for Democracy , was kept under house arrest , though she was allowed to cast her vote in a sealed envelope . 
907684:7	###Now , after a lull of several years , the boat people are heading for Australia again , this time from Cambodia . ###In the past few months , nearly two hundred have successfully made the dangerous voyage south ; most head for the north-western Australia port of Broom , where they 're interviewed by immigration officials . 
907797:8	###In the kitchen they write news bulletins for a daily radio programme for exiles . ###Among the campaigners is this Kuwaiti princess , in London when the Iraqis invaded , she does n't want to be identified because she fears for her life . 
907896:14	###Getting supplies to this place two hundred miles out of Amman has also proved a nightmare . ###Many are now being shifted to a new camp closer to the capital . 
907897:34	###Many are now being shifted to a new camp closer to the capital . ###But the volunteers have had to borrow one hundred thousand pounds so far to set it up . 
907933:64	###Did you feel that you were going to get out ? ###Eventually , but it might have been in a couple of years I thought . 
908017:35	###But dependence on imported oil has concentrated American minds on whether the United States should increase its own oil production or just use less . ###There are new oil fields off the American west coast , but environmental restrictions have made exploration and development almost impossible . 
908123:18	###They left after less than two hours of talks to report back to Saddam Hussein on the face of it having agreed to all allied demands . ###The most important point that we discussed was the immediate release of all prisoners of war . 
908147:190	###Could you give me an example ? ###Well , one talks about mechanics - Newton 's Law , I mean is where it starts from , and the nature of work - forces moving , doing work , and the use of energy when forces operate . 
908160:91	###Is it a question of economics , because if they were more efficient , that is if they used less fuel to get a given mileage , is it a question of the companies involved being unwilling to put the money into the development costs , or would cars that are more efficient cost a lot more money to buy ? ###I think it 's a complicated situation , and in fact this is one of the ideas of the course . 
908187:40	###I suppose in the nineteen fifties we all thought that was the answer to energy production , but there seem to have been a lot of problems over these since then . ###Are we going towards a greater nuclear power age or not ? 
908193:47	###It has inherent difficulties . ###At the moment nuclear power stations ca n't be turned up and down to meet fluctuations and demand , and the fluctuation from the morning and afternoon peak demand to the middle of the night trough in demand is at least a factor of two to one , but nuclear power stations cannot be turned up and down to match that . 
908194:63	###At the moment nuclear power stations ca n't be turned up and down to meet fluctuations and demand , and the fluctuation from the morning and afternoon peak demand to the middle of the night trough in demand is at least a factor of two to one , but nuclear power stations cannot be turned up and down to match that . ###They supply a constant load , therefore , so the user , the electricity user , has to be persuaded to even out his use of electricity , so night storage heaters are sold to people , just to be switched on at night , in order to provide a smoothing of the demand load . 
908238:25	###Storage is quite fundamental . ###Transport , for instance , requires that every car or lorry can carry its fuel with it , and petrol is in fact probably the most ideal fuel from almost every aspect . 
908249:156	###As we 've in fact transferred to oil , those coal heaps in many cases have actually been cleaned up and build on , so as oil runs out it perhaps will not be possible to reconvert back to coal use in some factories simply because the space for storage wo n't exist . ###In houses for heating it 's conceivable that you could have a huge hot water store in the basement , or a store made up of round pebbles , heated by hot air , which you could then use by circulating cool air through them to produce hot air at other times .

908315:19	###Is the energy demand in this country still increasing , or has it levelled out nowadays ? ###The domestic energy demand has remained constant for very many years . 
908375:138	###I think it makes a lot of demands on the teacher . ###It 's not something that is done easily or lightly . 
908392:24	###There has been a recent H M I report which has asked some questions about mixed ability teaching and expressed some worries about those teachers who perhaps do n't have the adequate support and preparation for mixed ability teaching , but they are certainly not against it , or the H M I is certainly not against mixed ability teaching . ###What research in this area needs to be done now ? 
908395:52	###Do you have plans yourself to engage in further research in this area ? ###Well I hope to look more at mixed ability teaching . 
908413:28	###erm in certain respects , yes . ###I suppose not entirely so . 
908414:107	###I suppose not entirely so . ###If anything I think women 's education now has to compensate a little erm and provide for those areas in which women start in a way that could be considered a handicap to men . 
908418:46	###Umm , again that 's very controversial . ###There is quite a bit of research , I think , to show that women do better at maths and science in single sex girls schools . 
908434:46	###I mean I would n't ever think it a good idea to encourage women to leave the home if they thought that their job was in there looking after small children , but it 's very obvious nowadays that a very large number of women do n't want to in the home any more . ###I do n't know what the recent statistics are , but something like almost half married women now do work outside the home anyway . 
908435:214	###I do n't know what the recent statistics are , but something like almost half married women now do work outside the home anyway . ###You could argue that some of them work outside the home because they have to , for financial reasons , but I think it 's indisputable that a ever-growing number want to work outside the home and I think it 's very important that they should be allowed the scope to do so . 
908443:62	###The house is all straight and you 're tired and then the kids come home from school and upset the house again , so you remake it again for the next day . ###Housework and organizing a home and looking after small children is very much context creating all the time , and you 're doing is in your capacity as a relation of , you know , certain males , other people of your family . 
908450:40	###Do you think it 's harder to be a women than a man in today 's world ? ###Oh certainly , certainly , erm boys grow up on the whole fairly secure in the knowledge that they have both work cells , occupational cells and also that they 'll be able to have families . 
908455:23	###The creches are n't there . ###The day provision for children is n't there . 
908463:10	###Girls somehow grow up thinking that perhaps they can do both , but they think that can have , you know , five or ten years off work and then go back to it . ###It 's not possible to do that any more . 
908467:85	###I mean certainly you ca n't achieve as much as a man does , but also the jobs just are n't there any more , not so much , and the main change I 'd like to see in education is that it would help girls cope with this dilemma . ###I mean at the moment it just evades it . 
908469:94	###I mean when I think of all the money that was poured into my education and nobody ever mentioned the kind of decisions one would have to make in the future and the problems you would have in trying to make use both of your education and have children and have the happy family life that our society encourages you to have and that we all perhaps want . ###erm schools just do n't help girls to have both and so a lot of the talk about underachievement , and I do n't like that word , amongst girls really ignores the fact that girls are n't underachieving when they do n't go all out for occupational success , when they do n't set their goals very high in schools , they are being very rational because if they do achieve they are going to be faced with immense problems . 
908476:29	###Academically , my own research is historical research . ###I 've been working mainly on girls ' education really from about eighteen ninety to about nineteen thirty and that 's what has mainly occupied me research wise . 
908483:63	###There was n't any chance really , well there was nothing which we could call there was no encouragement for girls to achieve anything academically or really encouragement for them to do anything much with their lives after they left school , aside from in the home , except for perhaps being domestic servants , something like that , which is after all the category of employment which absorbed most women until quite late on . ###But there have been an enormous number of changes . 
908484:22	###But there have been an enormous number of changes . ###I mean the very small number of girls that did get to university at the turn of the century had to endure the most extraordinary trials and hardships . 
908524:23	###I am depressed by the lack of provision for small children , because although we have things like the Equal Opportunities Commission and the S S R C funding , very generously research into what they call women 's under-achievement , educationally and occupationally and so on , that does n't seem to be the area in which things ought to be being done . ###It 's quite clear why women do n't achieve in the way define by the general public . 
908536:184	###I think - it really begins in the home this because it 's - mothers can do quite a lot in not educating their own sons to think of them as servants . ###A lot of women do this . 
908542:30	###Okay , Ken ? ###St Aldate 's museum lunchtime lecture : The Cinderella Army : Recollections of the Land Army by Doreen Griffiths 
908563:7	###Exactly , stock fields that never should have been ploughed were all ploughed to grow this corn . ###And erm so , of course , the land army came in then and erm 1939 , September , I do n't know , there were 900 volunteers already . 
908585:77	###Winchester . ###Oh yes , I know . 
908588:26	###And then of course in between milking we did the general work , whatever was going on . ###First day for me , because I was in the farming was doing afternoon milking the first few days . 
908613:10	###There you are , your name might be there ! ###Yes , I won first prize ! 
908618:14	###See you were mentioned you see ! ###I do n't know whether that though . 
908635:12	###We knew what that meant , wheelbarrow and shovel , bucket of water and a birch broom . ###Mine was wearing me wellington boots ! 
908639:60	###Well , I was alright , I learnt all about the harness eventually , and there 's in the you know , this throwback business when they 've been harnessed up . ###It 's all new . 
908669:27	###The smell of the beet fields . ###I remember once I got on to Norton because there was this I wanted to get to but I did do some shepherding there , and that was another fun , carrying , and that 's a winter job , carrying the sheep hurdling , hurdles and stakes , I worked with a gypsy , a Romany gypsy , and he could n't speak very much , and tended to sing , as if something not quite right about him . 
908674:7	###Anyway , from there we went to Gorkham where we are here with five of us , that was , that was the job , we had a cottage to ourselves . ###Five girls , and adjoining joining door into the cottage next door , and the shepherd 's wife next door used to cook our breakfast and our midday meal . 
908681:55	###Yes , the copper . ###You see where the fire 's been . 
908683:82	###The end of the bath the toilets and the loo which is a little Elsan , we had to empty that , opposite us there was the door into the living room , the hearth of the living room we had an open fire and we . ###The door went from there into the next cottage , now that was the open space . 
908683:170	###The end of the bath the toilets and the loo which is a little Elsan , we had to empty that , opposite us there was the door into the living room , the hearth of the living room we had an open fire and we . ###The door went from there into the next cottage , now that was the open space . 
908714:112	###We were the first farm in the area , I think , to make silage . ###And that goes back to the early days of silage . 
908715:22	###And that goes back to the early days of silage . ###Well , there were these round concrete blocks , with silos at the top , and they used to come in with these loads of scraps , tip it in and you know what we had to do ? 
908715:52	###And that goes back to the early days of silage . ###Well , there were these round concrete blocks , with silos at the top , and they used to come in with these loads of scraps , tip it in and you know what we had to do ? 
908724:90	###And that was when we came , and we started hay-making along there to the man-killers we called him , of course there 's a better picture here and I 've got it here along with the man-killer we caught it up , and we 've got someone coming along behind . ###That was what we call the man-killer . 
908725:167	###That was what we call the man-killer . ###You see the tractor driving it , there 's the load , this was gathering up the hay as it went along and it tipped it over and we had to make the loads you see . 
908730:202	###Yes . ###I just worked it out , do you know that was handled five times , those beet , because Pam used to go up and loosen with the plough , and then we come behind and pull it . 
908779:85	###Oh no , no , you should put it out to rot ! ###It should have been left out to rot . 
908803:12	###Where did you get that ? ###Well , good afternoon then folks , and welcome to the Electronic Publishing Group meeting ! 
908888:34	###One would n't employ a technician ###We would n't employ one . 
908896:13	###No , we do n't ! ###But I think we 're making life worse for ourselves , unnecessarily unpleasant for ourselves . 
908909:65	###It 's once you start giving them out , that 's what causes the problem . ###I think we could organise ourselves just a little bit better , erm 
908922:198	###I do n't know , I very much doubt it , I think it 's unlikely . ###Would we actually want that ? 
908923:14	###Would we actually want that ? ###I mean , it 's not a great , from a computing point of view , it 's not great having some erm you know vast faceless organisation which is going to make sure everything 's alright , because it means that when something goes wrong , it takes weeks and weeks and weeks to get it sorted out , because you have to fill in a form in triplicate , get it signed 
909025:15	###it 's gone out ###I I do n't think that 's a problem because we 're doing erm we 're doing two blocks of six and we 're onto the fourth of the first block now , but then the second block comes up in September and October , so it 's certainly in time for that . 
909159:16	###mhm . ###mhm . 
909207:92	###No . ###erm I think really what erm what should happen is that erm you , with your manager , ought to to to look at the the erm to establish and agreed job description and in addition to the notes that are are are there erm I have some sample job descriptions from other parts of the Press which have been completed as a framework job and erm we can discuss that in any kind of detail you want . 
909221:121	###A quick Corpus check on these . ###John Temple will be design expert in this erm Malcolm Price obviously production and Dave Stewart for sales and Loretta for secretaries erm and they have had a deal more training and briefing on the whole process .

909295:83	###Wednesday , 18th April 1990 , 2.30pm , Town Hall . ###Well , good afternoon , everybody , I think we 'd better get started . 
909435:47	###And there are all sorts of methods of sort of cheating the system , if you 're a timber industry in Ghana . ###erm There are possible ways of introducing chemical or dyes , or something like this , which we 're going to investigate , but I think its , if you find that a particular dye does it 's job , it wo n't be long before . 
909445:89	###Thank you very much . ###Any questions or comments ? 
909591:92	###You know , we 've worked hard on trying to get it in everywhere , into peoples ' notices and we 've linked up with Art Week quite well , as well . ###Well , thank you ever so much for telling you about it . 
909604:14	###Now the response , what they have done is they 've had a look , we have looked briefly at some of the aspects , overall aspects and you 'll find that in a number of these things , Oxford City Council is already quite heavily involved . ###And that 's good , and that 's to be encouraged . 
909633:10	###No , but the working out of the details will come through this so ###And just note the situation at the end 
909676:79	###So I do n't know if there 's any way we can pressurise ###Instead of using this flue gas desulphurisation ? 
909681:15	###So many labs require that gypsum is produced . ###Britain was actually given a lower standard check , on the basis that we would be using in many places our own coal , which has a quite a high sulphur content , or de-sulphurisation , we were given a lower standard , or a higher standard , or whatever it is , it was more relaxed for Britain , and that 's why I like the idea of taking this up with the M.E.D. , how it 'll happen , how it will square in his mind . 
909682:41	###Britain was actually given a lower standard check , on the basis that we would be using in many places our own coal , which has a quite a high sulphur content , or de-sulphurisation , we were given a lower standard , or a higher standard , or whatever it is , it was more relaxed for Britain , and that 's why I like the idea of taking this up with the M.E.D. , how it 'll happen , how it will square in his mind . ###So , we shall have to get a letter out to him . 
909702:55	###And we 're also going to set up our own site , which we 'll be able to carry on on a daily basis throughout the year , so obviously the schools ca n't do it during the holidays . ###erm There was also some interest shown by the Radcliffe Met . 
909706:10	###And I then want to be able to collect information on sources of pollution around their sites , if they notice particularly busy roads , things like that . ###Thank you very much , I 'm sure the committee would like to join with me to congratulate you both on the survey and on the very interesting report that you 've actually provided . 
909888:61	###Well , as you know , we always say the City Environmental Health Officer , and the officer responsible then does the work , we 've seen to that on our committee for years ###If you look at a department like the Director and Engineers department , every letter in fact has underneath it the City Engineer , even if its signed by somebody else . 
909925:16	###Could we have that repeated , please , I did n't hear it . ###She 's of the dictionary project that 's looking at transcribed spoken language . 
909926:10	###She 's of the dictionary project that 's looking at transcribed spoken language . ###Oh , we 'll have to be careful , then , wo n't we ! 
909982:48	###I would say just two things ; the one on the rates scheme , we certainly as a health committee distribute fifteen thousand pounds a year and treat these as important pledge by work . ###We ca n't deliberately do not maintain those voluntary groups which we feel are appropriately and better funded by the health authority . 
909988:30	###I can see Arthur , Betty and Liz . ###Chairman , may I first of all declare an interest in this . 
909989:108	###Chairman , may I first of all declare an interest in this . ###erm Under the new erm system erm every G P must at some time during the visit erm persons over seventy-five . 
910029:17	###Thank you Anne . ###Nonnie ? 
910073:23	###Keith , would you like to press your button and introduce us to item six , street collections in Oxford . ###Thanks , Chair . 
910130:101	###Right , Anne . ###I think there does come a point when there is resistance . 
910143:51	###Chair , could I make , could I suggest maybe that in future when you ask organisations you make it harder for getting a license for street collection , that you tell them that you 'll want to know exactly the proportions , but I mean put it back on to them , rather than be you having to bother to it in the future . ###Right , is that not done ? 
910145:165	###It is to a degree , on the application form that each charity receives , it has to state whether it collects for people in the Oxford area , but not as a percentage . ###I think that , more , not sort of say a general question like that , but say that after the collection has happened that you want returns for the number of people in Oxford that have benefited from the number of groups in Oxford that have benefited . 
910170:75	###Right , can I leave you then to the recommendations on page sixteen , notwithstanding all of the suggestions and comments that have been made , that we this year grant twenty-one Saturday City Centre permits , and the officers are clear twenty-one and not twenty-three , that we grant eleven City Centre , mid-week and suburban permits , and do you note that whoever is unsuccessful in obtaining Saturday City Centre permit will be granted one of those and given priority . ###Yes ? 
910220:7	###is that we 've been involved in health strategy for the past over five years . ###The ultimate test of any health in the city strategy is what we do about the health divide . 
910270:8	###erm Your comment on wards , I think this is a way of the officers giving us something to work on and take a decision on . ###Once they have a decision to work , then I would doubt very much actually they 're going to be into every corner of St Clements and East , or ignoring council estates altogether . 
910476:71	###Well , . ###erm On the question of the river samples and pool samples , yes , I think one of the city pools , one of the school pools we had a bit of a problem , so that took much of concentrated attention of it for a period of two or three weeks , so that 's probably a reflection , I do n't think much of it relates to the river sample . 
910482:28	###It may be worth saying , Tony that Graham 's already talked to officers and it 's worth your while talking to people on the house-to-house duty rota . ###Parties then with noise , just imagine going up to the door where there are fifty or sixty seething people in there . 
910483:14	###Parties then with noise , just imagine going up to the door where there are fifty or sixty seething people in there . ###In order to serve a notice you have to get a name , and that 's enormously difficult , because I mean , practical difficulties need to be taken on board , Anne and then Diana . 
910528:81	###Now , it 's obviously very good that a position is going to be replaced by a technician , for which a , which at the moment is elsewhere in the department . ###What erm my view is that we have a current shortfall , and I think the figures highlight this , and the shortfall is in the highest of the high risk , if you like , the ultra high-risk area of catering . 
910552:23	###Thank you . ###It 's a , it 's a fascinating report and having been involved in the Food Forum discussion , when we , it was reported to us that we 'd actually lost a community nutritionist , I read this with great interest to see just how now the professional was seen through sections . 
910554:61	###And , I mean , reluctantly we have to accept that this is not an ideal world , but I mean , just now , we were actually looking at the number of food hygiene inspections that have been done over the last few months , which have increased enormously , it just means , I mean it emphasises the fact that food has changed , food , and the number of places that are actually serving food now I mean , the corner shop does sandwiches . ###Everybody seems to be producing food , wherever you go food is on offer , food is for sale . 
910597:178	###And what 's more eighty-six percent of them answered it . ###And I was quite impressed by that . 
910599:39	###We gave them a sheet of paper which said what we were , what we 're doing , and said please , if you want any help in any of those areas , just tick the box , and if you do n't want any help , tick this little box , and that 's what they had to fill in . ###And they were given this when they were brought into the surgery by the receptionist . 
910672:8	###You know , large text , because they could n't afford it . ###There was nobody buying . 
910676:123	###The best Centaur , I think , is the Bible Centaur that we 've got , which okay it 's Bruce Rogers - it 's eighteen D on twenty-two , I think - it 's Bruce Rogers , but it 's also the monotype drawing office taking Centaur and doing things to it to make it work as a composition face at that size , beefing it up just enough so it actually holds , and that 's what his Bible 's in . ###And the figures in his Bible are n't Centaur figures , they are Monotype Plantin figures resized to fit with it and work with it . 
910684:35	###It allows people to get into the story - to read , to read . ###Do you know that page of yours from upper and lower cases on display in the Design Museum , that looks very well there - apart from the fact that you can read it from across the room . 
910775:84	###It 's a very good point . ###The only good things you can say about some of these new series , like Matthew Carter 's Cochin in fact that he did for Linotype are these other weights . 
910794:21	###He took over his own printing company called E L Hildreth in the forties and in the fifties sometime sold that out and set up a design shop to produce books and magazines , near Brattleboro , Vermont , and the prep school that I went to had retained him for many years as their printing adviser and , you know , he did the catalogues . ###I had a project as a student . 
910795:57	###I had a project as a student . ###They had a catalogue that had to be printed . 
910820:100	###And then I got into this whole thing about what I call the invisible descender theory , which is a joke in my studio but it 's been going on for , you know , nearly twenty years so it 's become a law . ###Tell me about the law , then . 
910823:65	###That in fact you exaggerate that space a little bit , you add a little bit more space to help out that line and that 's why if you have a headline you put a little extra space . ###It 's sort of descender protection . 
910824:10	###It 's sort of descender protection . ###And you can mass type , erm mass headlines , and we do negative type leading and all the rest , but you have to add up that extra descender space and put it at the bottom of the headline . 
910835:48	###I 'd say visual centre plus . ###So that 's just a little design style , very simple , to get people to understand . 
910861:31	###The trick is if you go away it does n't look like you have , and erm the same thing happens in a design studio , or if you 're the art director of a publication or of a book publisher , that everybody works together so it looks like it 's not all the same person doing everything . ###I mean it 's a team of people who get along and it 's very , very hard to do . 
910862:37	###I mean it 's a team of people who get along and it 's very , very hard to do . ###A lot of his personality , you know you have to like jolly people into liking and sublimating what their own inclination would be to some kind of group style . 
910866:60	###We 've started it in our studio , bringing their people into the city or setting up a kind of branch over there where people can work together and so you do n't get the political problems of ownerships , of people saying well that 's your idea , you know , it 's the old thing of as soon as the client thinks that it 's his idea then he wants it , and it 's very hard . ###It 's a difficult thing to do . 
910873:42	###A good deal of the time he or she can get it the first time . ###You know , if you work together a little bit . 
910885:53	###Oh that 's why it had so much impact , because it really was different on that . ###By allowing the experiments you get to the next stage . 
910918:14	###The problem with The Guardian is that it does n't look like a newspaper any more . ###mhm , mhm . 
910992:10	###Yes , yes . ###That 's what 
911064:13	###Crickey . ###And erm it 's wonderful . 
911161:65	###No , no . ###The first day Benguiat accused him - Parkinson printed up this sheet as a handout with which the finished examples had the logos that he was exploring in the lectures and one of them was the New York Times magazine , and of course Benguiat had done the original job for the New York Times and the magazine , the other magazine , so he thought that what Parkinson was showing was an example of a redesign , relettering of an existing logo , and perhaps he should n't of said that , you know .

911368:36	###We had to change the lock on their door , and the bloody lock cost thirty seven quid and each key cost five quid to cut , so we 're giving them fifty seven quids worth of security for nothing and they complain because I 'm not out by twelve o' clock . ###They were not happy with the Type ninety group .

911495:7	###The second big battle that Russell had in his unswerving pursuit of truth was with German idealism , mainly Hegelian idealism , which by a very curious aberration from the standard empiricism of the British people , took root in Oxford and Cambridge in the last half of the last century , and was almost for a time unchallenged . ###Russell first read mathematics at Cambridge and then , in the second half of his tripos , philosophy , and he then came strongly under this influence . 
911502:35	###It believes that everything in the world is related to everything else in such an intimate way that only the whole is , can be said to be real , and only by seeing everything in its associated network of the whole to which it belongs , of the complete whole to which it belongs , can it be understood . ###Piecemeal understanding of the world , bit by bit , is not on . 
911504:68	###Therefore all understanding , in any way worthy the name , has to begin from the whole of reality as such , and proceed outwards from there to the details of the world as we know it . ###That 's one . 
911515:56	###E . ###Moore , he rocketed off to the very opposite of metaphysical extremes . 
911517:15	###He came , towards the end of the nineties , to believe that there are erm there must be things which are in the strictest possible sense non-mental , and which would be what they were , even if there had never been any minds that were conscious of them . ###Moreover , erm the world can be broken down into elements , into simples , which you can perceive or grasp conceptually as what they are quite independently of the system as a whole to which they belong . 
911517:34	###He came , towards the end of the nineties , to believe that there are erm there must be things which are in the strictest possible sense non-mental , and which would be what they were , even if there had never been any minds that were conscious of them . ###Moreover , erm the world can be broken down into elements , into simples , which you can perceive or grasp conceptually as what they are quite independently of the system as a whole to which they belong . 
911560:10	###What however he did seek to do , starting from about nineteen-hundred erm and ten , or nineteen-twelve , was to apply the same methodological procedures which he 'd applied in mathematics , to a range of philosophical problems . ###I go on much too long . 
911579:44	###He was marvellously undogmatic , very open-minded , prepared always to have another go , if it became obvious that something would n't work . ###erm This is a quality I think which philosophers have all too seldom , and which he had in a very high degree . 
911614:80	###But , even supposing we do begin to awaken these sentiments in ourselves and other people , erm major problems are still ahead . ###Because human development is , in one of the many senses , dialectical . 
911616:73	###That 's to say that men embody themselves in partial versions of themselves , and then , in order to realize themselves more fully , they have to overcome by many kinds of struggle this previous realization . ###For example , in order to realize their inward potentialities , men project upon the world a belief in God , a belief in divine commands , and at a certain point in history no doubt this was progressive , this was a way in which people could see what Russell calls their potentialities . 
911624:15	###Self-centred , unbounded , destructive desires . ###Faulty education . 
911644:90	###He says erm addressing the statesmen of the world and ordinary citizens too , that his arguments have nothing whatever to do with merits or demerits of Communism or democracy . ###They are concerned solely with the welfare of the human species as a whole . 
911698:15	###South East Arts . ###Face the media course , 20 December 1982 
911710:166	###Could that be an indication that you are n't in fact giving the public what they want ? ###I would dispute that . 
911711:91	###I would dispute that . ###Certainly some of the productions that we are responsible for , as I have said , are controversial , and some of the public might not really want them and might dispute their validity , but I think what it is an indication of is the fact that people are short of money and have to make quite sure that they are getting the best value for what they are paying for and they ca n't afford to go to the theatre as regularly as they might have done in the past . 
911717:13	###I do n't think the new film categories are ###Just a second , sorry . 
911729:40	###But given that you 're using public money , ought you not to have a tighter control over this very aspect ? ###I would dispute that entirely , and I think it 's very dangerous for arts organizations to get closely involved in matters of detail in artistic control . 
911748:161	###How do you react to that ? ###Well I think it 's , public money should in fact be spent on it . 
911748:199	###How do you react to that ? ###Well I think it 's , public money should in fact be spent on it . 
911750:30	###It is invariably one whereby people have applied for those grants , they have gone through all the normal assessment criteria , which apply to any other art form , and if we feel that they adequately cover all those sort of areas then we respond , but as public body we have to be aware that groups , in applying to us , must fulfil the conditions that we lay down . ###What sort of conditions do you lay down ? 
911751:110	###What sort of conditions do you lay down ? ###Well we erm , in the sense that they must be legally constituted . 
911770:10	###I 've found that it 's a little early to make judgements about that just yet . ###I 've found that it was very necessary for me to take some time to get a grasp of what is a very complex situation and it would be rather foolish to jump in too quickly . 
911776:43	###But the bottom line of that is always money , and your money is public money . ###Yes , that 's quite right , we are in the area of dealing with public money . 
911776:182	###But the bottom line of that is always money , and your money is public money . ###Yes , that 's quite right , we are in the area of dealing with public money . 
911778:35	###We are accountable to the public in many different ways , and we always have to keep an eye on the fact that the public are looking at what we are doing with our money and local politicians and the community 's representatives are always anxious to talk to us about what we are doing with that money and we must be prepared to answer any queries or any questions on our activities or those activities of people that we 're sponsoring . ###How accountable do you feel that you are to the public ? 
911778:50	###We are accountable to the public in many different ways , and we always have to keep an eye on the fact that the public are looking at what we are doing with our money and local politicians and the community 's representatives are always anxious to talk to us about what we are doing with that money and we must be prepared to answer any queries or any questions on our activities or those activities of people that we 're sponsoring . ###How accountable do you feel that you are to the public ?

911798:9	###Yes , I think for a lot of people that 's true and I do n't denigrate that because I think a lot of good work goes on in the Women 's Institute , but what we are particularly interested in is in the professional craftsman , the craftsman who has trained for a number of year to produce extremely good work , and what we try to do is to make that work more available to the public in a number of ways . ###Firstly through exhibitions and our support for exhibitions organised by other organizations , and also by taking crafts into schools so that we are , if you like , exposing the younger generation to the best in the craft world , in the hope that in the future they will be the buyers of good craft work . 
911810:35	###Frances Smith thank you very much . ###Thank you . 
911816:7	###How do you get over that situation ? ###Well hopefully by sort of tact and explanation in equal doses . 
911820:18	###Let me ask you , why are you doing it ? ###I mean , what is the object of the South East Arts Association ? 
911842:40	###Now , in our case that means Kent , Surrey and East Sussex . ###We seek to achieve this in three ways : by offering specialist advice and information on all aspects of the arts ; by initiating certain schemes , projects and promotions of our own ; and by subsidizing professional arts activity and arts organizations . 
911976:22	###People being abrupt ? mhm ###People speaking too fast , so you ca n't . 
911986:32	###No , when they speak too loud . ###When they speak too loud down the telephone . 
911990:55	###Any other things that you find annoying ? ###Okay , there was a survey carried out by British Telecom , and they asked some of their customers what were the most frustrating things that can happen to you on the telephone , and this was the answer , and some of the things that you 've come up with are here . 
912064:33	###And then , when you 've got all the information , record the information , and repeat it , so you make sure you 've got all the key parts of the message down . ###And finally , to offer help . 
912099:37	###You 'll see why in a minute , erm these buttons are on the handset . ###Now , everybody knows how to get an outside line , do n't they ? 
912208:133	###This is the most useful facility I have known on the system . ###It 's very , very under-used , I use it a lot when I receive calls from engineers , elsewhere in the press , and I want to go back to my office but continue the same conversation . 
912213:27	###Let 's say you receive a call in your boss ' office , on your boss ' phone , it 's just come through to the wrong one . ###But you want to be in your office to answer that , properly , yes ? 
912248:14	###Switchboard , would n't it , and that 's not very good , because they 'd be answering a call twice . ###Obviously , I 'm just giving you the down-side , if you 're going to be there in your office , and you know you 're going to be there , you 're not going to dash off , or if you are , you can hear your phone ringing , erm it 's very , very handy , and in fact it 's smoother , because the person phoning in gets to speak to the person they want to speak to , not half a day , half a week later , alright ? 
912256:13	###Jo , Jo , you want to speak to Jo . ###Hello , may I speak to Jo please . 
912273:20	###You should be able to , occasionally . ###It might take a bit longer than . 
912358:10	###Do n't think that because it 's actually ringing that it 's somebody ringing , or whatever . ###Does that happen when you 're say , your extension rings , and somebody rings and in fact nothing happens . 
912365:27	###So when you , if someone camps on to you , is that what happens , if I take my desk , there 's an unusual amount of ringing and nobody there when I actually pick it up . ###Someone 's ringing when somebody 's camped on to you and they then decide they do n't want to call you . 
912385:195	###So , you finish the conversation , and you just flick the handset , you flick the black button in other words , you do n't fully put the handset down , so you flick the black button and you make another call and the camp on does n't mature , it does n't seem to mature because it does n't seem to be long enough for the computer to recognise that the conversation has ended . ###Is that what you meant ? 
912388:99	###Yes if it was erm , if it was ringing through , alright , and it 's a two seconds ring that you get , okay , you can either get it because the party is engaged , still , alright , in which case it 's not successful . ###So if it was , you would n't know that of course if you 'd picked up the phone , would you ? 
912395:7	###Any probs ? ###Right . 
912439:10	###erm I do n't know if anybody 's noticed , but before half past 8 in the morning and after half past 5 you get screaming night bells around the press , they 're not the blue phones , they 're the emergency phones , it 's the little square sort of socket-like thing above most of the corridors , and that screaming away tells you that there 's an outside caller ringing 56767 . ###What we 've done , is we 've set up an answer phone to pick up these calls after 13 seconds , after 13 rings sorry , about 30 seconds , which is quite a long time . 
912440:80	###What we 've done , is we 've set up an answer phone to pick up these calls after 13 seconds , after 13 rings sorry , about 30 seconds , which is quite a long time . ###We 've had to set it up like that , because sometimes people working late would like to pick up calls , expecting a call , or pick up calls on a different handset , . 
912476:19	###So I wo n't say too much about that either . ###Everything else you can use . 
912481:51	###The first person can key in star star 3 , the first one ringing will be answered . ###The next person to ring star star 3 , the next phone ringing will be answered . 
912483:104	###The beauty of the system is , group pick up , is that you do n't have to know the extension number of the phone ringing , obviously , star star 3 , that 's it . ###Right ? 
912484:24	###Right ? ###Call pick up , as opposed to group pick up , call pick up , should be on there , is star 3 and the extension number , and as you can imagine , you have to know what the extension number is before you actually access the facility . 
912497:42	###No you ca n't , because otherwise you 'd be able to call through the operator . ###It 's just Directory Enquiries , both national and international . 
912508:43	###But I was talking about internally . ###I S used to pay all the phone bills , and now we 've got wise to it . 
912550:112	###Still no goals , it 's play to Gascoigne , Gascoigne now still going forward , Gascoigne on the edge of the penalty , looking for the one two , he gets the one two , great tackle there by Les Robinson , there 's still a chance to Spurs Steve Foster , chance now - and it 's a goal to Spurs . ###He put it away , a bit of hesitation there in the Oxford United defence , and it 's a goal to Spurs scored by Gary Mafford , in fact he 's put the ball in the net ; mistake from Andy Melville gave Spurs a corner , the ball was n't cleared , Gascoigne played a one two , was blocked by United , it came out to Mafford in the end and the goal 's in so Spurs take the lead after eight minutes . 
912568:34	###Eleven minutes of this tie remaining , it 's far from dead , Martin Foyle . . ###And guess who was the man involved heading the ball from the chip ; Les Phillips once again laying the ball back to Martin Foyle . 
912648:34	###The final score here ; Fairmile hospital one , Milton United three . ###Back to the Hellenic League and the Premier Division ; Banbury nil , Almondsbury nil , our reporter Barry Worsley . 
912693:133	###Shearer equalised for Southampton with a penalty in the fifty second minute , and the replay at Southampton midweek . ###Notts County at home to Oldham went into a forty second minute lead through Turner , and this all second division clash saw Notts County go further ahead through Short after sixty five minutes ; two nil the final score . 
912697:60	###However , Brighton were not overawed and they came back with a penalty through Small after seventy three minutes . ###Burne netted number two for Brighton and these two sides go to the south coast in the week . 
912709:7	###You ca n't stop Gascoigne 's goal , I mean that 's tremendous play , great play . ###All the talk after the game is about Gascoigne , but he really had had a marvellous match had n't he ? 
912715:111	###Little Les Phillips just said in the dressing room , you ca n't get near him , he 's so explosive over five , ten yards , you know he played the one two bumpers into the ah , it 's a fantastic goal . ###But you know , let 's not talk him all the time because I think some of our players gave good performances today . 
912720:18	###Yes he Foyly , he 's got a heart as big as a lion and he 'll always do that , Foyly , whether he 's been injured or not , for you , and I 'm pleased he got the goals . ###erm People who get the goals get the headlines do n't they erm so I 'm pleased for him erm John Durning now is missing for two games erm he misses erm Oldham and Swindon , so that 's pleasing to have Foyly back . 
912724:36	###Finally , we 've got to bring the players back to earth a bit , but two absolute cracking games to look forward to in the next couple of weeks ; Oldham next week , probably the best footballing side in the second division , and away to Swindon the week after , so still a lot to look forward to although disappointment at going out of the Cup . ###There 's always things to look forward to football is n't there ? 
912729:107	###If we play like that we 're going to beat sides are n't we . ###It 's if we go back in and think we 're good players again like we did at West Brom and do n't compete . 
912737:8	###Well , they won by twelve points to seven , they move through to the semi-finals , just one match away from a performance at Twickenham ; reporting on the game this afternoon , Graham Cook . ###Bicester Rugby Club were in the semi-finals of the Provincial Insurance Cup following an excellent hard four weeks , to go to Gloucester opponents , Hucklecote Old Boys at this afternoon . 
912768:29	###And a try ###Marvellous victory . 
912802:99	###Anyway we 're going to go for trap two , Smoky Amber here , now she 's a bitch that is really , I think 's going to be something special over a longer trip , erm you know a longer distance , but she is only a March eighty nine so she 's not two yet . ###But erm she 's coming along the right way so it 's trap two , Smoky Amber for me there ; dangers I think will be Barefoot Champion six and Marla Gain in five . 
912808:18	###erm She 's having her first race tonight erm under her latest a newish trainer , Bernie Doyle , he 's doing ever so well , his kennel 's really in form erm so I 'm going to go for trap five , Hippy to win erm first time erm at the track tonight , that 's the third leg . ###erm And then the twelfth race , the ten twenty , there was just the top erm standard distance event , an A one grade , four fifty metres and I 'm going to go for trap one again , Ambridge Power , trained by Paul Garland , another nice erm nice dog , he 's running really well . 
912848:11	###Goalkeeper Bolder off his line , punched away only to Andy Melville on the edge of the penalty area ; Melville ran forward after picking up the loose ball , hammered it forward , Martin Foyle getting the last touch of the ball into the corner of the net , and United now seemingly pushing forward towards three points . ###It was Bolder again before half time , making a tremendous save to deny a Simpson shot and then three minutes before half time , his best save of the game ; somehow he kicked kneed Nogan 's shot away from five yards after more good work by United down the left side . 
912857:100	###The ball was slipped through to Robert Lee , he held off the challenge of goalkeeper Ken Vasey , and from seven yards , hammered the ball into the net . ###United had one more chance six minutes before the end when Martin Foyle did well to turn on the ball ; in the edge of the penalty area he hit a shot low and hard towards the corner of the net but it just drifted wide of the far post and United 's chance had gone . 
912874:80	###The visitors might have replied almost immediately when Mark Stepney rounded the defence but put his shot wide . ###As the game settled down , both sides struggled to get out of mid-field on a very heavy pitch , and clear chances were few and far between . 
912911:91	###Swindon having been beaten in the League Cup recently by Bicester , erm looked as though they were going to make a real match of it today when they scored in the eleventh minute . ###erm But they were disappointed when John Thorn equalised after another five minutes and he put them ahead at half time by two one . 
912965:15	###Well Tony Primmer 's an Australian and has been riding at Eastbourne and we were looking at him prior to this erm sort of amalgamation that came in because erm with our friendship with Bob Dugard , and looking for younger riders , he was sort of earmarked to come here at some stage . ###But not this year , but because we found ourselves in a very embarrassing situation with the forty point limit and the fact that we 've got Hans Nielson on ten point three two which you know , is good in one respect , but it erm makes very difficult situations down the bottom end . 
912970:11	###I 've always tried to keep too clear of foreign riders as you well know , but erm there are n't the riders around that you can slip in erm of the sort that we would want to put in . ###And as I 've said before , you know , we 've talked a lot about Primmer with Bob Dugard erm so we went for him . 
912972:187	###Bernard I must tell you , listening to you at the moment is Simon Wigg on one of our other lines erm just a word about Simon before I bring him in . ###You 're obviously sad to lose him but really , he 's one of these people riding all round the country who 's suffered because of the forty point limit . 
912994:99	###But erm the doctors have told me really I can do whatever I want to straight away virtually you know , and erm I 'll just give it another week or two weeks before I start practising erm and you know , I 'm very fit now . ###I 've actually never been as fit in my life before , I 've been erm you know , down the gym training erm every day and erm really sort of putting some hard work in and erm you know , I 'm in great shape . 
913013:21	###Right so we can have a few trophies at Oxford this season anyway Bernard . ###Well I hope so . 
913096:46	###Alright , what you did n't see , and I 've talked to the man who made the video , and he tells me that in fact - as played in slow motion , it does definitely show that Martin Foyle as the ball was going goalward , got the final touch to the ball and did put it into the net , no doubt that in fact it was Foyle 's goal . ###So Foyle retains the number four shirt for next week ? 
913116:48	###Well for now let 's go to another Charlton , soccer legend , Bobby Charlton , you heard him on Richard Rielly 's programme this afternoon , he 's coming to the area next Wednesday for the press launch of the Bobby Charlton Sports Day , which will be held at the Blackbird Ley 's leisure centre on the twenty fourth of April . ###Richard Rielly asked him for his views on Graham Kelly 's plea for clubs to share grounds if England are to stand a chance of hosting the nineteen ninety eight World Cup finals . 
913117:93	###Richard Rielly asked him for his views on Graham Kelly 's plea for clubs to share grounds if England are to stand a chance of hosting the nineteen ninety eight World Cup finals . ###I agree with that , erm I think that the big city clubs will have to eventually start sharing . 
913118:59	###I agree with that , erm I think that the big city clubs will have to eventually start sharing . ###It becomes so expensive erm and if we are going to get new facilities erm we ca n't just keep upgrading what we 've got now , we have to build new . 
913118:104	###I agree with that , erm I think that the big city clubs will have to eventually start sharing . ###It becomes so expensive erm and if we are going to get new facilities erm we ca n't just keep upgrading what we 've got now , we have to build new . 
913119:68	###It becomes so expensive erm and if we are going to get new facilities erm we ca n't just keep upgrading what we 've got now , we have to build new . ###erm And if we are going to compete in world sport then erm and if we have to apply like Manchester , who 's applying for the Olympic Games , we have to have the appropriate stadia . 
913133:44	###erm At the moment , well I would have thought that that was really unrealistic you know , the three teams joining together because geographically , they 're not really that close . ###But erm where the big city teams have good communications , you know , good bus and rail services , you know , then that 's it 's realistic to ask them to do it . 
913135:76	###erm Unfortunately when you 're short of money , you know , you have to try and get it from wherever you can and of course , in lots of cases , the supermarket chains have actually bailed out some football clubs , you know , by buying pieces of the car park etc . ###And it 's one way that they that the clubs can get planning permission to expand a little , so I do n't knock big business , I think that sponsorship in one form or another is very very important and vital . 
913137:12	###We ca n't just keep asking the people that actually pay to come to the matches to do it all the time , they have to be supplemented from industry anyway . ###I mean in Italy for example , you know some of the bigger clubs , you know they 're literally run by your Fiats etc. , big very very big companies , and I would say eventually , I 'm not saying in the near future , but certainly eventually , that that might happen here . 
913149:14	###You might not be able to come but at least you can you may at least have had the opportunity , so erm that 's how they 're being decided . ###Football obviously is the big one , so out of the two hundred you 'll probably get something like eighty footballers and then out of the other five sports that we 're going to host erm we will split them accordingly . 
913160:61	###And of course all the other matches today in the local leagues were postponed . ###Just time to have a little chat about greyhounds with our greyhound man , Mick Weeble ; I think you gave us one winner last week did n't you Mick ? 
913239:26	###Oh there are no , you know with the gaff this time , a lot of work like during the week and that and we 've tightened up quite a bit and tried to you know , get ourselves organised . ###And hopefully you know , hopefully get another one Wednesday , or Tuesday night as you say . 
913245:73	###Yes , he took a deflection off erm Andy Melville , I think he was going for his second , and erm I just managed to you know , just get down to my left and just keep it there , and it just sort of stuck so I was pleased with that . ###How about yourself , you 've settled well at United , though strangely when you were on loan everything seemed to be going so well did n't it , there were some good results coming . 
913252:17	###So obviously there 's a few tough games ahead , but you know , with erm if we set our out right and keep working hard , then hopefully we can get a few points and maybe push ourselves further up the table . ###And finally , Tuesday night - probably to you , what , a Londoner and playing down in Torquay , the game against Swindon , never taken so much significance , but a very very important game for Oxford United and their followers . 
913255:100	###Ken thanks for coming to talk to us . ###Lovely , thanks a lot . 
913294:60	###No that 's not frustration , that is a ploy , I just stick my hands up and show everybody that erm we messed a free kick up and then Paul erm slots it through . ###You 're making a habit of this of course , Notts County not so many weeks ago , three two the game was , and then you popped up with the equaliser right in the dying seconds . 
913328:118	###On sixty one minutes , Steve Jenkins turned well in the centre circle and sprayed the ball wide to Mark Walton , who in turn pushed the ball up the line to Berazi . ###Berazi turned inside angle , then crossed low to the near post , where Orme just managed to scramble the ball away . 
913396:81	###Three double one , one double one , get ringing quickly . ###I want to know who trained Quest for Fame and Sanglemore , he was a first season trainer , who rode both of them to victory in the respective Derbys and who owned both of them . 
913455:65	###I certainly will Peter , and erm looking forward to it . ###Let 's hope they do , that 's Nick Harris being optimistic as always . 
913459:77	###Well we were talking about the Jordan motor racing team , and talking about the major sponsorship deal from soft drink manufacturers Seven Up . ###And Eddy Jordan says his backing , that should cover nineteen ninety two as well . 
913489:37	###So as we get a platform on a level of erm if you like , performance , where we are compared to the Ferraris , the McClarens etc. , and any other ones down the field . ###erm We feel we can do well , I 'd be ecstatic if we could come away with a world championship point , I think we possibly can if we 're a bit lucky . 
913642:9	###With ten minutes to go , Paul Whittington did well to tip the ball over the Milton bar on two occasions as Lane pressed for the equaliser . ###But time was running out and with just two minutes remaining , Nigel Mott secured the points as he headed home Paul Biddle 's cross to make it two nil . 
913673:38	###The goals continued as Holden stroked home a in the seventy third minute , but a dreadful back pass by gave Bartley an open goal to make it four two . ###Within a minute of coming on , substitute Tony O' Donovan put Didcot right back in to the game and then Paul Spittle was so unlucky not to level the scores as his shot hit the post . 
913683:19	###And just before half time , the erm visitors got their goal erm when Steven scored from another corner , and the score at half time was two one . ###With the ground getting in terrible condition in the second half , both sides had plenty of chances to score , but the ball either stuck in the mud or the keeper saved . 
913684:67	###With the ground getting in terrible condition in the second half , both sides had plenty of chances to score , but the ball either stuck in the mud or the keeper saved . ###Leach , on one occasion had to go full length to save , and also the keeper at the other end too was kept very busy . 
913697:9	###Quite a run . ###Yes , very good , we 're climbing up the league now , week by week . 
913724:9	###That 's right , he 's gone to near neighbours , Buckingham erm we wish him all the best there , he 's done a fine job for us over two years . ###But erm the lads have got together and Clarkie scored erm four goals today so , we have n't missed him so much so far . 
913741:32	###But the kicking of Simon Hodgkinson brought England their first grand slam since nineteen eighty . ###He kicked four penalties and converted Rory Underwood 's try . 
913778:13	###I understand there 's only three people who are from the same team as last year . ###Yes that 's correct . 
913778:89	###I understand there 's only three people who are from the same team as last year . ###Yes that 's correct . 
913792:96	###Yes , we 've achieved erm well at the signing of the season I think erm from Poole , and we 're also recalling Mark Carlson who was one of our junior riders out on loan to Stoke . ###So why does such a great amount of personnel change - can you explain about the points system here . 
913801:44	###A couple of other changes over the closed season ; firstly the scare over Hans Neilson , I think Oxford erm Oxford Cheetahs fans had their hearts in their mouths for about erm a month or so ? ###Yes that 's right . 
913847:60	###Mick Allen played the ball to Tony McGovern who turned it in . ###City still looked as though they could have held on , but with four minutes to go , the roles were reversed as Cranfield 's McGovern set up Allen to level the scores . 
913860:86	###He 's just come in on the come back trail and he seems to me to be getting better and better . ###So it 's Social Circle as the second leg of the yankee in trap one , danger is the defending champion actually , last year 's winner of the Pall Mall , Noel 's Turbo , so it 'll be interesting to see how he goes . 
913864:9	###And the fourth and final leg of the erm Radio Oxford yankee erm is in the tenth race which is the nine forty eight , and I 'm going to stick with Darra Ash in trap four . ###This one comes from Perrybar up in Birmingham erm coming to form now , so that 's the fourth and final leg of our Radio Oxford yankee . 
913870:81	###Well let 's go back to Molyneux , a reminder of that result if you 've just joined us here on Talking Sport ; Wolves three , Oxford United three . ###Nick Harris has been talking with the Oxford United manager , Brian Horton . 
913877:23	###If we score got a chance and we had the chances to score first half , did n't take them obviously and we get the goal , right time , they went a bit nervous , and we went on did n't we - we could have won it . ###Daft as it seems , we could have won it because the kick was produced too quick for Paul Simpson and we hit the ball later on , Mark Stein 's a little back header , very unlucky not to win it for us . 
913880:35	###Well , you keep playing do n't you , it 's a ninety minute game , and then , as we 've said erm I believe it was two goals in the last four minutes , was it ? ###And we hit the bar as well , so it goes to the ninetieth minute does n't it , that 's what it is , a fifteen round fight goes to the last second does n't it as some boxers have found out . 
913957:10	###What . ###who is it , then . 
913963:9	###Miss put your great knees under the table . ###Are n't I , 
914069:17	###Let 's take a look . ###I am .

914155:23	###No , that you have n't marked , you have n't marked , ai n't it . ###No , the mark remains to be 
914300:12	###It 's not what he put on a woman , he put a on a woman , or something like that . ###Old woman walking down the street , right , and he stuck it on her back , or something like that . 
914316:7	###And he goes , do you think small ###and take it
